0,"It is my Great Honor to endorse America First Patriot Tracey Powell; a fantastic Candidate for Indiana's 21st State Senate District (which I won by 24 points!). Tracey is running against a pathetic RINO incumbent named Jim Buck; who; for whatever reason; voted against Redistricting in Indiana; which puts the United States Congress in jeopardy. Buck and his RINO friends made Indiana; a State I love and have been very good to; the only State in the Country that essentially said they don’t care if Democrats steal Republican House seats to take over the United States Congress. We could have easily picked up two seats in Indiana; helping Democrat seat theft in Blue States; but instead; Buck; an America Last politician; would rather give away our Majority in the House of Representatives; thereby putting our Country in a very dangerous position that could cost us some of the magnificent gains that we have made over the last year; since I assumed the Office of President. Tracey Powell; on the other hand; is a successful Businessman; Chiropractor; Farmer; and Highly Respected Tipton County Commissioner; who has dedicated his life to serving his Community. As your next State Senator; Tracey will fight tirelessly to Protect ""Hoosier"" Values; Grow the Economy; Cut Taxes and Regulations; Promote MADE IN THE U.S.A.; Champion our Amazing Farmers and Agriculture; Unleash American Energy DOMINANCE; Keep our Border SECURE; Ensure LAW AND ORDER; Support our Military; Veterans; and Law Enforcement; Advance Election Integrity; Defend our always under siege Second Amendment.  Tracey Powell has my Complete and Total Endorsement to be the next State Senator from Indiana's 21st Senate District. Unlike incumbent Jim Buck; a “RINO” who failed the wonderful people of Indiana so badly; TRACEY POWELL IS A WINNER WHO WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN!"

0,I am pleased to report that Venezuela is releasing its Political Prisoners at a rapid rate; which rate will be increasing over the coming short period of time. I’d like to thank the leadership of Venezuela for agreeing to this powerful humanitarian gesture! PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP
0,Our Trade Deals are very important to America. In each of these Deals; we have acted swiftly to reduce our TARIFFS in line with the Transaction agreed to. We; of course; expect our Trading Partners to do the same.  South Korea's Legislature is not living up to its Deal with the United States. President Lee and I reached a Great Deal for both Countries on July 30; 2025; and we reaffirmed these terms while I was in Korea on October 29; 2025. Why hasn't the Korean Legislature approved it? Because the Korean Legislature hasn't enacted our Historic Trade Agreement; which is their prerogative; I am hereby increasing South Korean TARIFFS on Autos; Lumber; Pharma; and all other Reciprocal TARIFFS; from 15% to 25%. Thank you for your attention to this matter! DONALD J. TRUMPPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
0,"It is my Great Honor to endorse State Representative Michelle Davis; a REAL Republican running for Indiana's 41st State Senate District (which I won by 33 points!); against RINO incumbent Greg Walker! Michelle will be a fantastic replacement for Walker who; for whatever reason; voted against Redistricting in Indiana; which puts the United States Congress in jeopardy. Walker and his RINO friends made Indiana; a State I love and have been very good to; the only State in the Country that essentially said they don’t care about what happens in the United States Congress. We could have easily picked up two seats in Indiana; so Walker; an America Last politician; put our Majority in the House of Representatives at risk; thereby putting our Country in a very dangerous position in losing some of the magnificent gains that we have made over the last year; since I assumed the Office of President. State Representative Michelle Davis; on the other hand; strongly voted WITH Republicans to pass Redistricting in the State House; unlike “RINO” Greg Walker; who voted with the Democrats in the State Senate to stop it. As your next State Senator; Michelle will fight tirelessly to Protect ""Hoosier"" Values; Advocate for the Working Men and Women of Indiana; Grow our Economy; Cut Taxes and Regulations; Promote American Manufacturing; Advance MADE IN THE U.S.A.; Unleash American Energy DOMINANCE; Keep our Border SECURE; Support our Military; Veterans; and Law Enforcement; Advance Election Integrity; and Defend our always under siege Second Amendment.  Michelle Davis has my Complete and Total Endorsement to be the next State Senator from Indiana's 41st Senate District. Unlike incumbent Greg Walker; a “RINO” LOSER who has failed the fantastic people of Indiana so badly; MICHELLE DAVIS IS A WINNER WHO WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN!"
0,The incredible people of Kentucky’s 4th Congressional District; who want desperately to get rid of Thomas Massie; the Worst “Republican” Congressman we have had in many years; gave us a mandate to; MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! The person that will help us do the job; and do it right; is Navy SEAL; Army Ranger; Fifth Generation Kentucky Farmer; and American Hero; Captain Ed Gallrein; a true Patriot. Today; Ed; who also happens to be central casting; officially filed to run for Congress. I have heard that there are other Candidates exploring a run for this seat; but I am asking all MAGA Warriors to rally behind Captain Ed Gallrein; the Candidate who is; far and away; best positioned to DEFEAT Third Rate Congressman Thomas Massie; a Weak and Pathetic RINO from the beautiful Commonwealth of Kentucky; a place I love; and won BIG; ALL THREE TIMES. A Brave Combat Veteran; Ed knows the Wisdom and Courage required to Defend our Country; Support our Military/Veterans; and Ensure PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH. He is a big fan of our recent attack on Nicolas Maduro; the Dictator of Venezuela. Additionally; as a very successful Businessman; Ed knows how to Create GREAT Jobs; Cut Taxes and Regulations; Promote MADE IN THE U.S.A.; Support our Amazing Farmers and American Agriculture; Unleash American Energy Dominance; and Champion our Nation’s Golden Age. In Congress; he will fight tirelessly to Keep our now very Secure Border; SECURE; Stop Migrant Crime; and Defend our always under siege Second Amendment. Captain Ed Gallrein has my Complete and Total Endorsement against “Congressman” Thomas Massie — He only votes AGAINST the Republican Party; making life very easy for the Radical Left. Unlike “lightweight” Congressman Massie; a true hater of Israel; and a totally ineffective LOSER who has failed us so badly; CAPTAIN ED GALLREIN IS A WINNER WHO WILL NOT LET KENTUCKY DOWN!

0,Governor Tim Walz called me with the request to work together with respect to Minnesota. It was a very good call; and we; actually; seemed to be on a similar wavelength. I told Governor Walz that I would have Tom Homan call him; and that what we are looking for are any and all Criminals that they have in their possession. The Governor; very respectfully; understood that; and I will be speaking to him in the near future. He was happy that Tom Homan was going to Minnesota; and so am I! We have had such tremendous SUCCESS in Washington; D.C.; Memphis; Tennessee; and New Orleans; Louisiana; and virtually every other place that we have “touched” and; even in Minnesota; Crime is way down; but both Governor Walz and I want to make it better! PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP
0,Just recovered the last Hostage body in GAZA. Thus; got back ALL 20 of the living Hostages; and ALL of the Dead! AMAZING JOB! Most thought of it as an impossible thing to do. Congratulations to my great team of Champions!!! President DJT
0,RT @realDonaldTrumpI am sending Tom Homan to Minnesota tonight. He has not been involved in that area; but knows and likes many of the people there. Tom is tough but fair; and will report directly to me. Separately; a major investigation is going on with respect to the massive 20 Billion Dollar; Plus; Welfare Fraud that has taken place in Minnesota; and is at least partially responsible for the violent organized protests going on in the streets. Additionally; the DOJ and Congress are looking at “Congresswoman” Illhan Omar; who left Somalia with NOTHING; and is now reportedly worth more than 44 Million Dollars. Time will tell all. Thank you for your attention to this matter! President DJT
0,Fake and Fraudulent Polling should be; virtually; a criminal offense. As an example; all of the Anti Trump Media that covered me during the 2020 Election showed Polls that were knowingly wrong. They knew what they were doing; trying to influence the Election; but I won in a Landslide; including winning the Popular Vote; all 7 of the 7 Swing States; the Electoral College was a route; and 2;750 Counties to 525. You can’t do much better than that; and yet if people examined The Failing New York Times; ABC Fake News; NBC Fake News; CBS Fake News; Low Ratings CNN; or the now defunct MSDNC; Polls were all fraudulent; and bore nothing even close to the final results. Something has to be done about Fraudulent Polling. Even the Polls of FoxNews and The Wall Street Journal have been; over the years; terrible! There are great Pollsters that called the Election right; but the Media does not want to use them in any way; shape; or form. Isn’t it sad what has happened to American Journalism; but I am going to do everything possible to keep this Polling SCAM from moving forward!

0,I can’t watch the new NFL Kickoff. Like many others; I just turn my head. Who has the right to make such a change? So disparaging to the game! The original was Big Time; Strong; Glamorous; and Exciting. The ridiculous new Kickoff Rule takes away the prestige and power of the game. I hope College Football doesn’t follow suit!
0,RT: https://truthsocial.com/users/realDonaldTrump/statuses/115958123338296139During the four years of Crooked Joe Biden and Democrat failed leadership; Tens of Millions of Illegal Alien Criminals poured into our Country; including Hundreds of Thousands of Convicted Murderers; Rapists; Kidnappers; Drug Dealers; and Terrorists. I won the Election in a Historic Landslide; and Republicans won Majorities in both the House and Senate; in large part; because we pledged to SEAL THE BORDER; which we have done; and launch the largest Mass Deportation of Illegal Alien Criminals in American History. This Deportation effort is underway; and in Republican run Cities and States; these operations are going peacefully and smoothly; because Local Law Enforcement Officers are allowed to work with their Federal counterparts. For example; in the five Republican run States of Texas; Georgia; Florida; Tennessee; and Louisiana; ICE has arrested 150;245 Criminal Illegal Aliens over the past year — with ZERO protests; riots; or chaos. Why? Because Local Police and ICE are cooperating and working together. Meanwhile; Democrat run Sanctuary Cities and States are REFUSING to cooperate with ICE; and they are actually encouraging Leftwing Agitators to unlawfully obstruct their operations to arrest the Worst of the Worst People! By doing this; Democrats are putting Illegal Alien Criminals over Taxpaying; Law-Abiding Citizens; and they have created dangerous circumstances for EVERYONE involved. Tragically; two American Citizens have lost their lives as a result of this Democrat ensued chaos.
0,That is why I am hereby calling on Governor Walz; Mayor Frey; and EVERY Democrat Governor and Mayor in the United States of America to formally cooperate with the Trump Administration to enforce our Nation’s Laws; rather than resist and stoke the flames of Division; Chaos; and Violence: 1. Governor Walz and Mayor Frey should turn over all Criminal Illegal Aliens that are currently incarcerated in their State Prisons and Jails to Federal Authorities; along with all Illegal Criminals with an active warrant or known Criminal History; for Immediate Deportation. 2. State and Local Law Enforcement must agree to turn over all Illegal Aliens arrested by Local Police. 3. Local Police must assist Federal Law Enforcement in apprehending and detaining Illegal Aliens who are wanted for Crimes. 4. Democrat Politicians must partner with the Federal Government to protect American Citizens in the rapid removal of all Criminal Illegal Aliens in our Country. Some Democrats; in places like Memphis; Tennessee; or Washington; D.C.; have done so; resulting in safer streets for ALL. In addition; I am hereby calling on the United States Congress to immediately pass Legislation to END Sanctuary Cities; which is the root cause of all of these problems. American Cities should be Safe Sanctuaries for Law Abiding American Citizens ONLY; not Illegal Alien Criminals who broke our Nation’s Laws. All of these requests are rooted in COMMON SENSE; and will provide the best possible circumstances to; MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! The Trump Administration is standing by; and waiting for ANY Democrat to do the right thing; and work with us on these important matters of MAKING AMERICA SAFE like it is in all sections of our Country where we are; together with Local Leadership; participating and involved. DONALD J. TRUMPPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
0,Minnesota is a Criminal COVER UP of the massive Financial Fraud that has gone on!
0,I’m building; on top of everything else that I am doing; one of the greatest and most beautiful Ballrooms anywhere in the World; with more than 300 Million Dollars of Great American Patriots’ money; and working closely with; right from the beginning; the United States Military and Secret Service. This is a GIFT (ZERO taxpayer funding!) to the United States of America; of 300 to 400 Million Dollars (depending on the scope and quality of interior finishes!); for a desperately needed space; sought for over 150 years by previous Presidents and Administrations; so that the White House would no longer be forced to use a cheap and unsafe “tent;” for big and important STATE EVENTS; Dinners; Meetings; Conferences; and already scheduled future INAUGURATIONS (for safety; security; and capacity purposes!); on a very wet; and subject to weather; White House lawn. Making such a large gift to the U.S.A. was thought to be; by almost everyone; “A WONDERFUL THING TO DO” — But no; as usual; I got sued; this time by the Radical Left National (No!)Trust for Historic Preservation; a group that couldn’t care less about our Country! All of the Structural Steel; Windows; Doors; A.C./Heating Equipment; Marble; Stone; Precast Concrete; Bulletproof Windows and Glass; Anti-Drone Roofing; and much more; has been ordered (or is ready to be); and there is no practical or reasonable way to go back. IT IS TOO LATE! Why didn’t these obstructionists and troublemakers bring their baseless lawsuit much earlier? Congress never tried; or wanted; to stop the Ballroom Project! Everyone knew what was taking place at the White House — A great; big; beautiful gift to the United States of America! For those that are interested; the tiny East Wing was so “bastardized” and changed; built and rebuilt over the years; that it bore no resemblance or relationship to the original building. The so-called “preservationists;” who get their money from the most unusual of places; should not be allowed to stop this desperately needed addition to our GREAT White House; a place that a President has never needed permission to change or enhance; because of the special grounds on which it sits; no matter how big (and important!); that enhancement may be. Additionally; in this instance; it is being done with the design; consent; and approval of the highest levels of the United  States Military and Secret Service. The mere bringing of this ridiculous lawsuit has already; unfortunately; exposed this heretofore Top Secret fact. Stoppage of construction; at this late date; when so much has already been ordered and done; would be devastating to the White House; our Country; and all concerned. Thank you for your attention to this matter! President DONALD J. TRUMP
0,RT @realDonaldTrumpI am so happy to have helped in saving TikTok! It will now be owned by a group of Great American Patriots and Investors; the Biggest in the World; and will be an important Voice. Along with other factors; it was responsible for my doing so well with the Youth Vote in the 2024 Presidential Election. I only hope that long into the future I will be remembered by those who use and love TikTok. Thank you to Vice President JD Vance; and all of the others within my Administration; who helped bring this Deal to a very dramatic; final; and beautiful conclusion. I would also like to thank President Xi; of China; for working with us and; ultimately; approving the Deal. He could have gone the other way; but didn’t; and is appreciated for his decision.

0,RT @realDonaldTrumpGavin Newscum; as a “Lame Duck” Governor of a Failing State; should not be at Davos running around screaming for the attention of Foreign Leaders; and embarrassing our Country. He made a mockery of himself; and everybody; including his staff; knows it! He should get the permits so that people can build their homes destroyed by the fire that he could have prevented if he would have allowed water to flow from the Pacific Northwest. He should finish his monstrously “overbudget and behind schedule” Railroad; from San Francisco to L.A.; one of the Greatest Public Disasters in History; and focus on stopping Crime in the streets of California Cities — Then finish out his term; and GO HOME! With a record like he’s got; the ruination of one of the most beautiful places on Earth; where people are leaving in droves; it is unimaginable that he could run for President but; who knows; it’s a very strange World!

He is a Lifelong Leader; both on and off the field — A true WINNER! As your next Governor; “Coach” will work tirelessly to Grow the Economy; Cut Taxes and Regulations; Promote MADE IN THE U.S.A.; Champion American Energy DOMINANCE; Keep our Border SECURE; Stop Migrant Crime; Ensure LAW AND ORDER; Strengthen our Military/Veterans; Safeguard our Elections; and Protect our always under siege Second Amendment. I was proud to endorse “Coach” when he ran for the Senate in 2020; and am honored to do so again. I’d love to keep him as a Senator; because he was great; but he wants to be the Governor in the State he loves; and that’s OK with me! Tommy Tuberville has my Complete and Total Endorsement to be the next Governor of the Great State of Alabama – COACH TUBERVILLE WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN!
0,"RT @realDonaldTrumpI am hearing that Bluffton City Councilman Blake Fiechter; a True America First Patriot; is considering a primary challenge against “RINO” State Senator Travis Holdman; in Indiana’s 19th Senate District who; for whatever reason; voted against Redistricting in Indiana; in a District that I won by 39 points; which puts the United States Congress in jeopardy. Holdman and his RINO friends made Indiana; a State I love and have been very good to; the only State in the Country that essentially said they don’t care about what happens in the United States Congress. We could have easily picked up two seats in Indiana; so Holdman; an America Last politician; put our Majority in the House of Representatives at risk; thereby putting our Country in a very dangerous position in losing some of the magnificent gains that we have made over the last year; since I assumed the Office of President. On the other hand; Blake Fiechter; a very successful Real Estate Broker; Proud Husband; Loving Father to three girls; and a Highly Respected Councilman in the wonderful City of Bluffton; has dedicated his life to serving the Community which he loves so much. As your next State Senator; Blake would fight tirelessly to Protect ""Hoosier"" Values; Promote our Amazing Farmers and Ranchers; Grow our Economy; Cut Taxes and Regulations; Advance MADE IN THE U.S.A.; Promote American Energy DOMINANCE; Keep our Border SECURE; Support our Brave Military; Veterans; and Law Enforcement; Ensure LAW AND ORDER; Safeguard our Elections; and Protect our always under siege Second Amendment.  Should he decide to enter this Race; and hopefully he will; Blake Fiechter has my Complete and Total Endorsement against RINO Travis Holdman. RUN; BLAKE; RUN!"

0,This is the gunman’s gun; loaded (with two additional full magazines!); and ready to go – What is that all about? Where are the local Police? Why weren’t they allowed to protect ICE Officers? The Mayor and the Governor called them off? It is stated that many of these Police were not allowed to do their job; that ICE had to protect themselves — Not an easy thing to do! Why does Ilhan Omar have $34 Million Dollars in her account? And where are the Tens of Billions of Dollars that have been stolen from the once Great State of Minnesota? We are there because of massive Monetary Fraud; with Billions of Dollars missing; and Illegal Criminals that were allowed to infiltrate the State through the Democrats’ Open Border Policy. We want the money back; and we want it back; NOW. Those Fraudsters who stole the money are going to jail; where they belong! This is no different than a really big Bank Robbery. Much of what you’re witnessing is a COVER UP for this Theft and Fraud. The Mayor and the Governor are inciting Insurrection; with their pompous; dangerous; and arrogant rhetoric! Instead; these sanctimonious political fools should be looking for the Billions of Dollars that has been stolen from the people of Minnesota; and the United States of America. LET OUR ICE PATRIOTS DO THEIR JOB! 12;000 Illegal Alien Criminals; many of them violent; have been arrested and taken out of Minnesota. If they were still there; you would see something far worse than you are witnessing today!

0,Trump in Davos: 'When America Booms; the Entire World Booms': https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/donald-trump-davos-economy/2026/01/21/id/1242951/
0,Maybe we should have put NATO to the test: Invoked Article 5; and forced NATO to come here and protect our Southern Border from further Invasions of Illegal Immigrants; thus freeing up large numbers of Border Patrol Agents for other tasks.
0,Gavin Newscum; as a “Lame Duck” Governor of a Failing State; should not be at Davos running around screaming for the attention of Foreign Leaders; and embarrassing our Country. He made a mockery of himself; and everybody; including his staff; knows it! He should get the permits so that people can build their homes destroyed by the fire that he could have prevented if he would have allowed water to flow from the Pacific Northwest. He should finish his monstrously “overbudget and behind schedule” Railroad; from San Francisco to L.A.; one of the Greatest Public Disasters in History; and focus on stopping Crime in the streets of California Cities — Then finish out his term; and GO HOME! With a record like he’s got; the ruination of one of the most beautiful places on Earth; where people are leaving in droves; it is unimaginable that he could run for President but; who knows; it’s a very strange World!
0,Mortgage Rates just hit a Three Year Low despite Jerome “Too Late” Powell; and his never ending quest to keep Interest Rates high (against “TRUMP!”). It just shows that he has been wrong all along; because the Market is overtaking his obstinance. The Fed has been hurt and discredited during Too Late’s reign!
0,Highly Respected Senator; “Coach” Tommy Tuberville; is running for Governor of Alabama; a place I love and WON BIG; six times; including Primaries; in 2016; 2020; and 2024! A former SEC Championship winning College Football Coach; and now; as a Highly Respected U.S. Senator; Tommy has proven he has the Courage and Wisdom to deliver strong results for the incredible people of his wonderful State and Nation. He is a Lifelong Leader; both on and off the field — A true WINNER! As your next Governor; “Coach” will work tirelessly to Grow the Economy; Cut Taxes and Regulations; Promote MADE IN THE U.S.A.; Champion American Energy DOMINANCE; Keep our Border SECURE; Stop Migrant Crime; Ensure LAW AND ORDER; Strengthen our Military/Veterans; Safeguard our Elections; and Protect our always under siege Second Amendment. I was proud to endorse “Coach” when he ran for the Senate in 2020; and am honored to do so again. I’d love to keep him as a Senator; because he was great; but he wants to be the Governor in the State he loves; and that’s OK with me! Tommy Tuberville has my Complete and Total Endorsement to be the next Governor of the Great State of Alabama – COACH TUBERVILLE WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN!
0,I am hearing that Alabama GOP Chairman; John Wahl; a true MAGA Warrior and America First Patriot; is considering launching his Campaign for Lieutenant Governor; and I hope he does! John has been with us from the very beginning; and has been key to our many Republican Victories in the Great State of Alabama; a State that I won with the Highest Vote in Alabama History; including my HISTORIC WINS in 2016; 2020; and 2024! As your next Lieutenant Governor; John would fight tirelessly to Grow the Economy; Cut Taxes and Regulations; Promote MADE IN THE U.S.A.; Support our Amazing Farmers and Fishermen; Unleash American Energy DOMINANCE; Keep our Border SECURE; Stop Migrant Crime; Ensure LAW AND ORDER; Strengthen our Brave Military/Veterans; Safeguard our Elections; and Defend our always under siege Second Amendment. Should he decide to enter this Race; John Wahl has my Complete and Total Endorsement. RUN; JOHN; RUN!
0,"I am hearing that Bluffton City Councilman Blake Fiechter; a True America First Patriot; is considering a primary challenge against “RINO” State Senator Travis Holdman; in Indiana’s 19th Senate District who; for whatever reason; voted against Redistricting in Indiana; in a District that I won by 39 points; which puts the United States Congress in jeopardy. Holdman and his RINO friends made Indiana; a State I love and have been very good to; the only State in the Country that essentially said they don’t care about what happens in the United States Congress. We could have easily picked up two seats in Indiana; so Holdman; an America Last politician; put our Majority in the House of Representatives at risk; thereby putting our Country in a very dangerous position in losing some of the magnificent gains that we have made over the last year; since I assumed the Office of President. On the other hand; Blake Fiechter; a very successful Real Estate Broker; Proud Husband; Loving Father to three girls; and a Highly Respected Councilman in the wonderful City of Bluffton; has dedicated his life to serving the Community which he loves so much. As your next State Senator; Blake would fight tirelessly to Protect ""Hoosier"" Values; Promote our Amazing Farmers and Ranchers; Grow our Economy; Cut Taxes and Regulations; Advance MADE IN THE U.S.A.; Promote American Energy DOMINANCE; Keep our Border SECURE; Support our Brave Military; Veterans; and Law Enforcement; Ensure LAW AND ORDER; Safeguard our Elections; and Protect our always under siege Second Amendment.  Should he decide to enter this Race; and hopefully he will; Blake Fiechter has my Complete and Total Endorsement against RINO Travis Holdman. RUN; BLAKE; RUN!"
0,The people who brought the Tariff Litigation against our Country; now in the United States Supreme Court; are strongly China oriented; and very upset by the fact that the United States is doing so well — GIANT GROWTH AND INVESTMENT; ALMOST NO INFLATION! These people; in some cases Americans; should be ashamed of themselves. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

0,Congresswoman Ilhan Omar is worth over $30 Million Dollars. There is no way such wealth could have been accumulated; legally; while being paid the salary of a politician. She should be investigated for Financial and Political Crimes; and that investigation should start; NOW!
0,RECORD NUMBERS ALL OVER THE PLACE! SHOULD I TRY FOR A FOURTH TERM?
0,The “Donroe Doctrine” In Action: https://americanmind.org/salvo/the-donroe-doctrine-in-action/
0,Based on his testimony today; there is no question that Deranged Jack Smith should be prosecuted for his actions. He destroyed the lives of many innocent people; which has been his history as a prosecutor. At a minimum; he committed large scale perjury!
0,Today; I am announcing the United States’ intention to bid for the World Expo 2035. The Great State of Florida has expressed strong interest in hosting the Expo in Miami; which I fully support. Miami Expo 2035 can be the next big milestone in our new Golden Age of America. I am appointing Miami native Secretary of State Marco Rubio to Chair the efforts of coordinating and advancing this exciting opportunity to convene the World. We will create thousands of jobs; and add Billions of Dollars in GROWTH; to our Economy. In my First Term as President; I fought hard to bring the 2026 FIFA World Cup and 2028 LA Summer Olympics to the U.S.A. I now have the Honor of hosting as the 47th President; plus America250; G20 Doral; and the G7. I look forward to winning and participating in the Miami Expo 2035!
0,Heading back to D.C. It was an incredible time in Davos. The Greenland structure is being worked on; and will be amazing for the U.S.A.; and the Board of Peace is something that the World has never seen before — Very special. So many good things happening! PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP
0,Trump sues JPMorgan Chase and CEO Jamie Dimon for $5B over alleged 'political' debanking: https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/trump-sues-jpmorgan-chase-ceo-jamie-dimon-5b-over-alleged-political-debanking
0,Deranged Jack Smith is being DECIMATED before Congress. It was over when they discussed his past failures and unfair prosecutions. He destroyed many lives under the guise of legitimacy. Jack Smith is a deranged animal; who shouldn’t be allowed to practice Law. If he were a Republican; his license would be taken away from him; and far worse! Hopefully the Attorney General is looking at what he’s done; including some of the crooked and corrupt witnesses that he was attempting to use in his case against me. The whole thing was a Democrat SCAM — A big price should be paid by them for what they have put our Country through!
0,Something has to be done about Fake Polls! They are truly OUT OF CONTROL. We have the Greatest Economy in the History of our Country; we have the Strongest Border in History; nobody has ever done a job like I have done; and they have me in the low 40s. The Democrats destroyed Healthcare; I’m trying to fix it; and they give me FAKE low numbers. Fake Polls on the Economy; on the Border; on just about everything; are ridiculous and dangerous. The REAL Polls have been GREAT; but they refuse to print them. This is no different than a writer who is corrupt; of which there are many. The New York Times; and so many others; print Polls that are knowingly false. They have become deranged; and sick. They suffer from a major case of TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME (TDS). Their 2024 Election coverage was so bad; and so wrong; and yet they never get called out for it — But I am calling them out with the lawsuit that I have filed which is making its way through the Courts. They have to pay a price for FAKE AND FRAUDULENT NEWS and; hopefully; in the not too distant future; they will!
0,The Times Siena Poll; which is always tremendously negative to me; especially just before the Election of 2024; where I won in a Landslide; will be added to my lawsuit against The Failing New York Times. Our lawyers have demanded that they keep all Records; and how they “computed” these fake results — Not just the fact that it was heavily skewed toward Democrats. They will be held fully responsible for all of their Radical Left lies and wrongdoing!

This solution; if consummated; will be a great one for the United States of America; and all NATO Nations. Based upon this understanding; I will not be imposing the Tariffs that were scheduled to go into effect on February 1st. Additional discussions are being held concerning The Golden Dome as it pertains to Greenland. Further information will be made available as discussions progress. Vice President JD Vance; Secretary of State Marco Rubio; Special Envoy Steve Witkoff; and various others; as needed; will be responsible for the negotiations — They will report directly to me.

0,Shockingly; our “brilliant” NATO Ally; the United Kingdom; is currently planning to give away the Island of Diego Garcia; the site of a vital U.S. Military Base; to Mauritius; and to do so FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER. There is no doubt that China and Russia have noticed this act of total weakness. These are International Powers who only recognize STRENGTH; which is why the United States of America; under my leadership; is now; after only one year; respected like never before. The UK giving away extremely important land is an act of GREAT STUPIDITY; and is another in a very long line of National Security reasons why Greenland has to be acquired. Denmark and its European Allies have to DO THE RIGHT THING. Thank you for your attention to this matter. PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP
0,Just watched footage of the Church Raid in Minnesota by the agitators and insurrectionists. These people are professionals! No person acts the way they act. They are highly trained to scream; rant; and rave; like lunatics; in a certain manner; just like they are doing. They are troublemakers who should be thrown in jail; or thrown out of the Country. The first to go should be Walz; and Fake Sleazebag; Ilhan Omar; who is supposedly worth over $30 Million Dollars; even though she’s never had anything but a Government job. Investigate these Corrupt Politicians; and do it now!
0,Note from President Emmanuel Macron; of France:
0,I had a very good telephone call with Mark Rutte; the Secretary General of NATO; concerning Greenland. I agreed to a meeting of the various parties in Davos; Switzerland. As I expressed to everyone; very plainly; Greenland is imperative for National and World Security. There can be no going back — On that; everyone agrees! The United States of America is the most powerful Country anywhere on the Globe; by far. Much of the reason for this is a rebuilding of our Military during my First Term; which rebuilding continues at even more expedited pace. We are the only POWER that can ensure PEACE throughout the World — And it is done; quite simply; through STRENGTH! PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP

0,ICE is removing some of the most violent criminals in the World from our Country; and bring them back home; where they belong. Why is Minnesota fighting this? Do they really want murderers and drug dealers to be ensconced in their community? The thugs that are protesting include many highly paid professional agitators and anarchists. Is this really what Minnesota wants? The crooked Governor and “Congresswoman” Omar; who married her brother; don’t mind because it keeps the focus of attention off the 18 Billion Dollar; Plus; FRAUD; that has taken place in the State!

0,RT @realDonaldTrumpWe have subsidized Denmark; and all of the Countries of the European Union; and others; for many years by not charging them Tariffs; or any other forms of remuneration. Now; after Centuries; it is time for Denmark to give back — World Peace is at stake! China and Russia want Greenland; and there is not a thing that Denmark can do about it. They currently have two dogsleds as protection; one added recently. Only the United States of America; under PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP; can play in this game; and very successfully; at that! Nobody will touch this sacred piece of Land; especially since the National Security of the United States; and the World at large; is at stake. On top of everything else; Denmark; Norway; Sweden; France; Germany; The United Kingdom; The Netherlands; and Finland have journeyed to Greenland; for purposes unknown. This is a very dangerous situation for the Safety; Security; and Survival of our Planet. These Countries; who are playing this very dangerous game; have put a level of risk in play that is not tenable or sustainable. Therefore; it is imperative that; in order to protect Global Peace and Security; strong measures be taken so that this potentially perilous situation end quickly; and without question. Starting on February 1st; 2026; all of the above mentioned Countries (Denmark; Norway; Sweden; France; Germany; The United Kingdom; The Netherlands; and Finland); will be charged a 10% Tariff on any and all goods sent to the United States of America. On June 1st; 2026; the Tariff will be increased to 25%. This Tariff will be due and payable until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland. The United States has been trying to do this transaction for over 150 years. Many Presidents have tried; and for good reason; but Denmark has always refused. Now; because of The Golden Dome; and Modern Day Weapons Systems; both Offensive and Defensive; the need to ACQUIRE is especially important. Hundreds of Billions of Dollars are currently being spent on Security Programs having to do with “The Dome;” including for the possible protection of Canada; and this very brilliant; but highly complex system can only work at its maximum potential and efficiency; because of angles; metes; and bounds; if this Land is included in it. The United States of America is immediately open to negotiation with Denmark and/or any of these Countries that have put so much at risk; despite all that we have done for them; including maximum protection; over so many decades. Thank you for your attention to this matter!DONALD J. TRUMPPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

0,Everyone is asking about the Autopen? What was done is totally illegal; and anything signed that way is of “no further force or effect.” The person who “worked” the Autopen had no idea whether or not Biden approved of what he was doing. There was no ORDER in writing; and it was an absolutely illegal act perpetrated by the Radical Left Insurrectionists who illegally ran the Biden Administration. Every one of them should be arrested for what they have done to our Country. They didn’t win the Presidency but; when you think of it; neither did Joe Biden. The whole thing was RIGGED. There must be a price to pay; and it has got to be a BIG ONE! PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP
0,We have subsidized Denmark; and all of the Countries of the European Union; and others; for many years by not charging them Tariffs; or any other forms of remuneration. Now; after Centuries; it is time for Denmark to give back — World Peace is at stake! China and Russia want Greenland; and there is not a thing that Denmark can do about it. They currently have two dogsleds as protection; one added recently. Only the United States of America; under PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP; can play in this game; and very successfully; at that! Nobody will touch this sacred piece of Land; especially since the National Security of the United States; and the World at large; is at stake. On top of everything else; Denmark; Norway; Sweden; France; Germany; The United Kingdom; The Netherlands; and Finland have journeyed to Greenland; for purposes unknown. This is a very dangerous situation for the Safety; Security; and Survival of our Planet. These Countries; who are playing this very dangerous game; have put a level of risk in play that is not tenable or sustainable. Therefore; it is imperative that; in order to protect Global Peace and Security; strong measures be taken so that this potentially perilous situation end quickly; and without question. Starting on February 1st; 2026; all of the above mentioned Countries (Denmark; Norway; Sweden; France; Germany; The United Kingdom; The Netherlands; and Finland); will be charged a 10% Tariff on any and all goods sent to the United States of America. On June 1st; 2026; the Tariff will be increased to 25%. This Tariff will be due and payable until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland. The United States has been trying to do this transaction for over 150 years. Many Presidents have tried; and for good reason; but Denmark has always refused. Now; because of The Golden Dome; and Modern Day Weapons Systems; both Offensive and Defensive; the need to ACQUIRE is especially important. Hundreds of Billions of Dollars are currently being spent on Security Programs having to do with “The Dome;” including for the possible protection of Canada; and this very brilliant; but highly complex system can only work at its maximum potential and efficiency; because of angles; metes; and bounds; if this Land is included in it. The United States of America is immediately open to negotiation with Denmark and/or any of these Countries that have put so much at risk; despite all that we have done for them; including maximum protection; over so many decades. Thank you for your attention to this matter!DONALD J. TRUMPPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
0,A front page Article in The Fake News Wall Street Journal states; without any verification; that I offered Jamie Dimon; of JPMorgan Chase; the job of Fed Chairman. This statement is totally untrue; there was never such an offer and; in fact; I’ll be suing JPMorgan Chase over the next two weeks for incorrectly and inappropriately DEBANKING me after the January 6th Protest; a protest that turned out to be correct for those doing the protesting — The Election was RIGGED! Why wouldn’t The Wall Street Journal call me to ask whether or not such an offer was made? I would have very quickly told them; “NO;” and that would have been the end of the story. Also; one was led to believe that I offered Jamie Dimon the job of Secretary of the Treasury; but that would be one that he would be very interested in. The problem is; I have Scott Bessent doing a fantastic job; A SUPERSTAR — Why would I give it to Jamie? No such offer was made there; or even thought of; either. The Wall Street Journal ought to do better “fact checking;” or its already strained credibility will continue to DIVE. Thank you for your attention to this matter!

0,As Steve Witkoff announced; we have OFFICIALLY entered the next phase of Gaza’s 20-Point Peace Plan! Since the Ceasefire; my team has helped deliver RECORD LEVELS of Humanitarian Aid to Gaza; reaching Civilians at HISTORIC speed and scale. Even the United Nations has acknowledged this achievement as UNPRECEDENTED. These results have set the stage for this next phase. As Chairman of the Board of Peace; I am backing a newly appointed Palestinian Technocratic Government; the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza; supported by the Board's High Representative; to govern Gaza during its transition. These Palestinian leaders are unwaveringly committed to a PEACEFUL future! With the support of Egypt; Turkey; and Qatar; we will secure a COMPREHENSIVE Demilitarization Agreement with Hamas; including the surrender of ALL weapons; and the dismantling of EVERY tunnel. Hamas must IMMEDIATELY honor its commitments; including the return of the final body to Israel; and proceed without delay to full Demilitarization. As I have said before; they can do this the easy way; or the hard way. The people of Gaza have suffered long enough. The time is NOW. PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH.

Thank you for you attention to this matter! President DJT
0,A highly respected judge declined to block I.C.E. operations in the very politically corrupt State of Minnesota. I.C.E. will therefore be allowed to continue its highly successful operation of removing some of the most violent and vicious criminals anywhere in the World; many of them murderers; from the State. The great patriots of Law Enforcement will continue to make our Country safe. RECORD LOW CRIME NUMBERS!!!

They get sent Millions of Dollars of Taxpayer Money; and laugh at how STUPID the Americans are; but not anymore. These people should be sent back to Somalia; or any other Country from where they came. California; Illinois; New York; and so many other places are equally as bad. It’s all a giant Democrat SCAM; with protection from the Fake News Media but; it will end; as we; MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

0,RT @realDonaldTrumpBREAKING NEWS: Numbers released today show that the United States of America has the lowest Trade Deficit since 2009; and going even lower. In addition; our Nation’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is predicted to come in at over 5%; and that is after losing at least 1.5% to the Democrat “Shutdown.” These incredible numbers; and the unprecedented SUCCESS of our Country; are a direct result of TARIFFS; which have rescued our Economy and National Security. I hope the Supreme Court is aware of these Historic; Country saving achievements prior to the issuance of their most important (ever!) Decision. Thank you for your attention to this matter! PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP

0,The United States needs Greenland for the purpose of National Security. It is vital for the Golden Dome that we are building. NATO should be leading the way for us to get it. IF WE DON’T; RUSSIA OR CHINA WILL; AND THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN! Militarily; without the vast power of the United States; much of which I built during my first term; and am now bringing to a new and even higher level; NATO would not be an effective force or deterrent - Not even close! They know that; and so do I. NATO becomes far more formidable and effective with Greenland in the hands of the UNITED STATES.Anything less than that is unacceptable. Thank you for your attention to this matter! President DJT
0,Congratulations Jon!
0,Under my stewardship; the Economy is booming! A Manufacturing Renaissance and soaring Household Incomes are powering GDP gains that have not been seen in decades; and we are undergoing a DIS-inflationary boom. The Private Sector is growing by over 5% thanks to the most Business Investment we have ever seen; maybe in History; and Inflation trends are looking GOOD. All the smart money knows the “HOTTEST” Economy in the World is the U.S.A. TIME TO INVEST!
0,Minnesota is Trump Country! I won 78 out of 87 Counties. The Election was swung by Corrupt Counties around Minneapolis and St. Paul; represented by disgusting Ilhan Omar. Moronic Tim Walz has allowed Minnesota to become overrun by Somali fraudsters who steal from American Taxpayers; and take advantage of our generosity. Tim is completely incompetent; which is why he lost big time last year; and bowing out of Re-Election is the only good decision he has ever made. I have instructed Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent to FOLLOW THE MONEY; and put an END to this abuse once and for all; first in Minnesota; and then all around the Country!
0,Sadly; the Great Influencer; Scott Adams; has passed away. He was a fantastic guy; who liked and respected me when it wasn’t fashionable to do so. He bravely fought a long battle against a terrible disease. My condolences go out to his family; and all of his many friends and listeners. He will be truly missed. God bless you Scott!

0,Do the people of Minnesota really want to live in a community in which there are thousands of already convicted murderers; drug dealers and addicts; rapists; violent released and escaped prisoners; dangerous people from foreign mental institutions and insane asylums; and other deadly criminals too dangerous to even mention. All the patriots of ICE want to do is remove them from your neighborhood and send them back to the prisons and mental institutions from where they came; most in foreign Countries who illegally entered the USA though Sleepy Joe Biden’s HORRIBLE Open Border’s Policy. Every place we go; crime comes down. In Chicago; despite a weak and incompetent Governor and Mayor fighting us all the way; a big improvement was made. Thousands of Criminals were removed! Minnesota Democrats love the unrest that anarchists and professional agitators are causing because it gets the spotlight off of the 19 Billion Dollars that was stolen by really bad and deranged people. FEAR NOT; GREAT PEOPLE OF MINNESOTA; THE DAY OF RECKONING &amp; RETRIBUTION IS COMING!

0,Under Sleepy Joe Biden and the Radical Left Democrats; the average American Household’s monthly Utility bills went up MASSIVELY — over 30%! I never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers. Therefore; my Administration is working with major American Technology Companies to secure their commitment to the American People; and we will have much to announce in the coming weeks. First up is Microsoft; who my team has been working with; and which will make major changes beginning this week to ensure that Americans don’t “pick up the tab” for their POWER consumption; in the form of paying higher Utility bills. We are the “HOTTEST” Country in the World; and Number One in AI. Data Centers are key to that boom; and keeping Americans FREE and SECURE but; the big Technology Companies who build them must “pay their own way.” Thank you; and congratulations to Microsoft. More to come soon! President DJT

0,The actual numbers that we would have to pay back if; for any reason; the Supreme Court were to rule against the United States of America on Tariffs; would be many Hundreds of Billions of Dollars; and that doesn’t include the amount of “payback” that Countries and Companies would require for the Investments they are making on building Plants; Factories; and Equipment; for the purpose of being able to avoid the payment of Tariffs. When these Investments are added; we are talking about Trillions of Dollars! It would be a complete mess; and almost impossible for our Country to pay. Anybody who says that it can be quickly and easily done would be making a false; inaccurate; or totally misunderstood answer to this very large and complex question. It may not be possible but; if it were; it would be Dollars that would be so large that it would take many years to figure out what number we are talking about and even; who; when; and where; to pay. Remember; when America shines brightly; the World shines brightly. In other words; if the Supreme Court rules against the United States of America on this National Security bonanza; WE’RE SCREWED!PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP

0,This is according to Michael F. Cannon; Director of Healthcare Policy at the CATO Institute: “Don’t extend the ObamaCare subsidies — Would be like making ObamaCare permanent. You have to stop talking about it now. Tell Congress; ‘I want to make permanent those Rules that I put into place in 2018; giving people access to ObamaCare exempt planning’ — Because then Premiums will FALL; by 50% or more; for most people. I want to go back to the three year window where you can get in there for ObamaCare where you won’t pay as much. Don’t expand ObamaCare. Congress must make Trump Rules permanent. These were President Trump’s 2018 Short Term Plans Rule that President Obama terminated. All Congress has to do is say; ‘Look; the Short Term Plans can last up to 36 months; your Insurer can sell you a Renewal Guarantee so it can last even beyond that period; and you will get lower priced Insurance; better Insurance; Longer Term Insurance and; it doesn’t cost Taxpayers a dime or; it won’t destabilize ObamaCare.’ Much simpler than what President Trump’s advisers are selling him; much better to assuage the fears of nervous Democrats; because we had these Rules in place for six years; and ObamaCare did not crater. Subsidies will not solve this problem. Government should be capping what it spends on Healthcare at ZERO. Send them a check. No need for subsidies. Congress has to get out of the way of Private Insurance Companies. Give the money to the Consumers to buy directly from the Health Insurance Companies.”

Most of those Cubans are DEAD from last weeks U.S.A. attack; and Venezuela doesn’t need protection anymore from the thugs and extortionists who held them hostage for so many years. Venezuela now has the United States of America; the most powerful military in the World (by far!); to protect them; and protect them we will. THERE WILL BE NO MORE OIL OR MONEY GOING TO CUBA - ZERO!

Everyone is in daily contact. Today’s meeting will almost exclusively be a discussion on Venezuelan Oil; and our longterm relationship with Venezuela; its Security; and People. A very big factor in this involvement will be the reduction of Oil Prices for the American People. Additionally; and perhaps most importantly of all; will be the stoppage of Drugs and Criminals coming into the United States of America. Thank you for your attention to this matter!

0,BREAKING NEWS: Numbers released today show that the United States of America has the lowest Trade Deficit since 2009; and going even lower. In addition; our Nation’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is predicted to come in at over 5%; and that is after losing at least 1.5% to the Democrat “Shutdown.” These incredible numbers; and the unprecedented SUCCESS of our Country; are a direct result of TARIFFS; which have rescued our Economy and National Security. I hope the Supreme Court is aware of these Historic; Country saving achievements prior to the issuance of their most important (ever!) Decision. Thank you for your attention to this matter! PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP
0,Biden ignored the Housing Market; and instead was immersed with High Crime; Open Borders; runaway INFLATION; the Afghanistan Disaster; and a Military that he left in Chaos and Confusion. Everything was broken; but I; as President of the United States; have already fixed it! Now; I am giving special attention to the Housing Market. Because I chose not to sell Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in my First Term; a truly great decision; and against the advice of the “experts;” it is now worth many times that amount — AN ABSOLUTE FORTUNE — and has $200 BILLION DOLLARS IN CASH. Because of this; I am instructing my Representatives to BUY $200 BILLION DOLLARS IN MORTGAGE BONDS. This will drive Mortgage Rates DOWN; monthly payments DOWN; and make the cost of owning a home more affordable. It is one of my many steps in restoring Affordability; something that the Biden Administration absolutely destroyed. We are bringing back the AMERICAN DREAM that was destroyed by the last Administration. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
0,I just finished a great meeting with the very successful Intel CEO; Lip-Bu Tan. Intel just launched the first SUB 2 NANOMETER CPU PROCESSOR designed; built; and packaged right here in the U.S.A. The United States Government is proud to be a Shareholder of Intel; and has already made; through its U.S.A. ownership position; Tens of Billions of Dollars for the American People — IN JUST FOUR MONTHS. We made a GREAT Deal; and so did Intel. Our Country is determined to bring leading edge Chip Manufacturing back to America; and that is exactly what is happening!!!
0,Republicans should be ashamed of the Senators that just voted with Democrats in attempting to take away our Powers to fight and defend the United States of America. Susan Collins; Lisa Murkowski; Rand Paul; Josh Hawley; and Todd Young should never be elected to office again. This Vote greatly hampers American Self Defense and National Security; impeding the President’s Authority as Commander in Chief. In any event; and despite their “stupidity;” the War Powers Act is Unconstitutional; totally violating Article II of the Constitution; as all Presidents; and their Departments of Justice; have determined before me. Nevertheless; a more important Senate Vote will be taking place next week on this very subject.

0,It was a Great Honor to speak with the President of Colombia; Gustavo Petro; who called to explain the situation of drugs and other disagreements that we have had. I appreciated his call and tone; and look forward to meeting him in the near future. Arrangements are being made between Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the Foreign Minister of Colombia. The meeting will take place in the White House in Washington; D.C.
0,I have just been informed that Venezuela is going to be purchasing ONLY American Made Products; with the money they receive from our new Oil Deal. These purchases will include; among other things; American Agricultural Products; and American Made Medicines; Medical Devices; and Equipment to improve Venezuela’s Electric Grid and Energy Facilities. In other words; Venezuela is committing to doing business with the United States of America as their principal partner – A wise choice; and a very good thing for the people of Venezuela; and the United States. Thank you for your attention to this matter!
0,After long and difficult negotiations with Senators; Congressmen; Secretaries; and other Political Representatives; I have determined that; for the Good of our Country; especially in these very troubled and dangerous times; our Military Budget for the year 2027 should not be $1 Trillion Dollars; but rather $1.5 Trillion Dollars. This will allow us to build the “Dream Military” that we have long been entitled to and; more importantly; that will keep us SAFE and SECURE; regardless of foe. If it weren’t for the tremendous numbers being produced by Tariffs from other Countries; many of which; in the past; have “ripped off” the United States at levels never seen before; I would stay at the $1 Trillion Dollar number but; because of Tariffs; and the tremendous Income that they bring; amounts being generated; that would have been unthinkable in the past (especially just one year ago during the Sleepy Joe Biden Administration; the Worst President in the History of our Country!); we are able to easily hit the $1.5 Trillion Dollar number while; at the same time; producing an unparalleled Military Force; and having the ability to; at the same time; pay down Debt; and likewise; pay a substantial Dividend to moderate income Patriots within our Country!PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP
0,I have been informed by the Department of War that Defense Contractor; Raytheon; has been the least responsive to the needs of the Department of War; the slowest in increasing their volume; and the most aggressive spending on their Shareholders rather than the needs and demands of the United States Military. Raytheon seems to think this is the Biden Administration; and this is “business as usual;” IT’S NOT! Either Raytheon steps up; and starts investing in more upfront Investment like Plants and Equipment; or they will no longer be doing business with Department of War. Also; if Raytheon wants further business with the United States Government; under no circumstances will they be allowed to do any additional Stock Buybacks; where they have spent Tens of Billions of Dollars; until they are able to get their act together. Our Country comes FIRST; and they’re going to have to learn that; the hard way! PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP
0,I have just viewed the clip of the event which took place in Minneapolis; Minnesota. It is a horrible thing to watch. The woman screaming was; obviously; a professional agitator; and the woman driving the car was very disorderly; obstructing and resisting; who then violently; willfully; and viciously ran over the ICE Officer; who seems to have shot her in self defense. Based on the attached clip; it is hard to believe he is alive; but is now recovering in the hospital. The situation is being studied; in its entirety; but the reason these incidents are happening is because the Radical Left is threatening; assaulting; and targeting our Law Enforcement Officers and ICE Agents on a daily basis. They are just trying to do the job of MAKING AMERICA SAFE. We need to stand by and protect our Law Enforcement Officers from this Radical Left Movement of Violence and Hate! PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP
0,All United State Defense Contractors; and the Defense Industry as a whole; BEWARE: While we make the best Military Equipment in the World (No other Country is even close!); Defense Contractors are currently issuing massive Dividends to their Shareholders and massive Stock Buybacks; at the expense and detriment of investing in Plants and Equipment. This situation will no longer be allowed or tolerated! Also; Executive Pay Packages in the Defense Industry are exorbitant and unjustifiable given how slowly these Companies are delivering vital Equipment to our Military; and our Allies. Salaries; Stock Options; and every other form of Compensation are far too high for these Executives. Defense Companies are not producing our Great Military Equipment rapidly enough and; once produced; not maintaining it properly or quickly. From this moment forward; these Executives must build NEW and MODERN Production Plants; both for delivering and maintaining this important Equipment; and for building the latest Models of future Military Equipment. Until they do so; no Executive should be allowed to make in excess of $5 Million Dollars which; as high as it sounds; is a mere fraction of what they are making now. Additionally; the maintenance and repair of Equipment; once sold; is far too slow; and must be immediately enhanced. As President; I am demanding that maintenance be “spot on; on time.” Therefore; I will not permit Dividends or Stock Buybacks for Defense Companies until such time as these problems are rectified — Likewise; for Salaries and Executive Compensation. MILITARY EQUIPMENT IS NOT BEING MADE FAST ENOUGH! It must be built now with the Dividends; Stock Buybacks; and Over Compensation of Executives; rather than borrowing from Financial Institutions; or getting the money from your Government. Longer term; this is good for both Executives and Shareholders; because it will be GREAT for our Country! Thank you for your attention to this matter. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! DONALD J. TRUMPPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
0,For a very long time; buying and owning a home was considered the pinnacle of the American Dream. It was the reward for working hard; and doing the right thing; but now; because of the Record High Inflation caused by Joe Biden and the Democrats in Congress; that American Dream is increasingly out of reach for far too many people; especially younger Americans. It is for that reason; and much more; that I am immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes; and I will be calling on Congress to codify it. People live in homes; not corporations. I will discuss this topic; including further Housing and Affordability proposals; and more; at my speech in Davos in two weeks.
0,In honor of the late; GREAT; Congressman Doug LaMalfa; a true American Patriot and fantastic Representative of Northern California; yesterday I ordered all American Flags throughout the United States lowered to Half Mast until this evening. Doug will be dearly missed!
0,Remember; for all of those big NATO fans; they were at 2% GDP; and most weren’t paying their bills; UNTIL I CAME ALONG. The USA was; foolishly; paying for them! I; respectfully; got them to 5% GDP; AND THEY PAY; immediately. Everyone said that couldn’t be done; but it could; because; beyond all else; they are all my friends. Without my involvement; Russia would have ALL OF UKRAINE right now. Remember; also; I single-handedly ENDED 8 WARS; and Norway; a NATO Member; foolishly chose not to give me the Noble Peace Prize. But that doesn’t matter! What does matter is that I saved Millions of Lives. RUSSIA AND CHINA HAVE ZERO FEAR OF NATO WITHOUT THE UNITED STATES; AND I DOUBT NATO WOULD BE THERE FOR US IF WE REALLY NEEDED THEM. EVERYONE IS LUCKY THAT I REBUILT OUR MILITARY IN MY FIRST TERM; AND CONTINUE TO DO SO. We will always be there for NATO; even if they won’t be there for us. The only Nation that China and Russia fear and respect is the DJT REBUILT U.S.A. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!! President DJT

I have asked Energy Secretary Chris Wright to execute this plan; immediately. It will be taken by storage ships; and brought directly to unloading docks in the United States. Thank you for your attention to this matter! DONALD J. TRUMPPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

0,Nobody knows Henry Cuellar better than Donald J. Trump. I studied his records; learned about his financing; and listened to his two wonderful daughters beg me to help the mother and father that they love. Their letters were heart wrenching and beautiful; but their father had problems that nobody could solve but me; and the daughters very correctly and respectfully knew that. He and his wife were headed to jail for up to 20 years because he was “stupid” in what he did but; above all; because the Biden Administration practiced Political Weaponization on Cuellar and his wife because they didn’t agree with his policies on the Southern Border. He was a weak and incompetent version of me; who wanted the Border closed to criminals; drug dealers; people from mental institutions and; above all; murderers and heavy handed criminals that were sitting in jails and mental institutions; and should never have been given the right to be released into our Country. Henry’s views on these subjects were not strong; but they were better than other Democrats. Biden and his crew of Radical Left Thugs did not like those things about Cuellar; and they worked hard; and expected to put him in jail for the rest of his life. Being an expert on Political Weaponization; based on what the Biden Losers had done to me; and without having ever met Henry Cuellar; and in particular because of the magnificence of the letter drawn by his daughters asking me to help “Mom and Dad;” I gave him and Mrs. Cuellar a full and unconditional Pardon. In doing so; I never assumed he would be running for Office again; and certainly not as a Democrat; who essentially destroyed his life even with the Pardon given; but he did; and now; despite doing him by far the greatest favor of his life; 20 years of FREEDOM; I am fighting him for his seat in Congress because his views are not nearly as good or strong as Judge Tano Tijerina; who is much more powerful on the Border issue; cutting Taxes; our Military; and just about everything else than is Henry Cuellar.
0,A Great and Highly Respected Hispanic Judge; very successful Businessman; and Rancher; Tano Tijerina has dedicated his life to serving his Community. In Congress; he will fight tirelessly to Grow our Economy; Promote our Amazing Farmers and Ranchers; Cut Taxes and Regulations; Promote MADE IN THE U.S.A.; Champion American Energy DOMINANCE; Keep our now very Secure Border; SECURE; Stop Migrant Crime; Ensure LAW AND ORDER; Strengthen our Military/Veterans; and Protect our always under siege Second Amendment. I don’t know why; but the fact that Henry Cuellar would be running against Donald J. Trump; and the Republican Party; seems to be a great act of disloyalty and; perhaps more importantly; the act of a fool who would immediately go back to a Political Party; the Radical Left Democrats; whose views are different from his; but not nearly good or strong enough to be a true Republican. The Democrats wanted to put him “away” for the rest of his life and; likewise; the life of his wife. Knowing everything and; if I had to do it again; I would do the exact same thing. I would pardon Henry Cuellar because he was put through a Political Persecution; but he was also not smart in what he did; not respected by his Party; and a person who truly deserves to be beaten badly in the upcoming Election; but not somebody who should be serving a 20 year jail sentence. Likewise; however; based on all that has happened; Henry should not be allowed to serve in Congress again. Tano’s views are stronger; better; and far less tainted than Henry’s; and he has my Complete and Total Endorsement to be the next Representative from Texas’ 28th Congressional District — HE WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN!
0,It is my Great Honor to endorse America First Patriot; Amanda McKinney; who is running to represent the wonderful people of Washington’s 4th Congressional District. A very successful Business Executive; Civic Leader; and Highly Respected Yakima County Commissioner; Amanda has dedicated her life to serving her Community. As your next Congresswoman; Amanda will fight tirelessly to Grow our Economy; keep our now very Secure Border; SECURE; Stop Migrant Crime; Support our Incredible Military/Veterans; Advance American Energy DOMINANCE; Cut Taxes and Regulations; Promote MADE IN THE U.S.A.; Defend our always under siege Second Amendment; and Ensure PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH. Amanda McKinney has my Complete and Total Endorsement to be the next Representative from Washington’s 4th Congressional District — SHE WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN!
0,Two Highly Respected America First Patriots; Jay Feely and Gina Swoboda; are running for Congress in the Great State of Arizona; a very special place to me in that we had a BIG Presidential Election Win just over one year ago; on November 5; 2024! Both fierce advocates of Make America Great Again; Jay and Gina have been with us from the very beginning; and either one would be an incredible Representative who would work tirelessly to Grow our Economy; Cut Taxes and Regulations; Promote MADE IN THE U.S.A.; Champion American Energy DOMINANCE; Keep our now very Secure Border; SECURE; Stop Migrant Crime; Strengthen our Military/Veterans; and Defend our always under siege Second Amendment. Therefore; I am honored to give both Jay Feely and Gina Swoboda my Complete and Total Endorsement to be the next Representative of Arizona’s 1st Congressional District – JAY OR GINA WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN!

0,Today; the Trump Administration is proud to announce the United States of America’s updated Childhood Vaccination Schedule. This Schedule is rooted in the Gold Standard of Science; and widely agreed upon by Scientists and Experts all over the World. Effective today; America will no longer require 72 “jabs” for our beautiful; healthy children. We are moving to a far more reasonable Schedule; where all children will only be recommended to receive Vaccinations for 11 of the most serious and dangerous diseases. Parents can still choose to give their children all of the Vaccinations; if they wish; and they will still be covered by insurance. However; this updated Schedule finally aligns the United States with other Developed Nations around the World. Congratulations to HHS Secretary Bobby Kennedy; CDC Acting Director Jim O’Neil; FDA Commissioner Marty Makary; CMS Administrator Dr. Oz; NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya; and all of the Medical Experts and Professionals who worked very hard to make this happen. Many Americans; especially the “MAHA Moms;” have been praying for these COMMON SENSE reforms for many years. Thank you for your attention to this matter! DONALD J. TRUMPPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

0,Minnesota’s Corrupt Governor will possibly leave office before his Term is up but; in any event; will not be running again because he was caught; REDHANDED; along with Ilhan Omar; and others of his Somali friends; stealing Tens of Billions of Taxpayer Dollars. I feel certain the facts will come out; and they will reveal a seriously unscrupulous; and rich; group of “SLIMEBALLS.” Governor Walz has destroyed the State of Minnesota; but others; like Governor Gavin Newscum; JB Pritzker; and Kathy Hochul; have done; in my opinion; an even more dishonest and incompetent job. NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW!
0,We have taken in; and will soon be receiving; more than 600 Billion Dollars in Tariffs; but the Fake News Media refuses to talk about it because they hate and disrespect our Country; and want to interfere with the upcoming Tariff decision; one of the most important ever; of the United States Supreme Court. Because of Tariffs; our Country is financially; AND FROM A NATIONAL SECURITY STANDPOINT; FAR STRONGER AND MORE RESPECTED THAN EVER BEFORE. GOD BLESS AMERICA! President DONALD J. TRUMP

0,The United States of America has successfully carried out a large scale strike against Venezuela and its leader; President Nicolas Maduro; who has been; along with his wife; captured and flown out of the Country. This operation was done in conjunction with U.S. Law Enforcement. Details to follow. There will be a News Conference today at 11 A.M.; at Mar-a-Lago. Thank you for your attention to this matter! President DONALD J. TRUMP
0,Tariffs are an overwhelming benefit to our Nation; as they have been incredible for our National Security and Prosperity (like nobody has ever seen before!). Losing our ability to Tariff other countries who treat us unfairly would be a terrible blow to the United States of America. Thank you for your attention to this matter! President Donald J. Trump

0,The White House Doctors have just reported that I am in “PERFECT HEALTH;” and that I “ACED” (Meaning; was correct on 100% of the questions asked!); for the third straight time; my Cognitive Examination; something which no other President; or previous Vice President; was willing to take. P.S.; I strongly believe that anyone running for President; or Vice President; should be mandatorily forced to take a strong; meaningful; and proven Cognitive Examination. Our great Country cannot be run by “STUPID” or INCOMPETENT PEOPLE! President DJT

0,Great job by Art Del Cueto; a Border hero; in explaining; on FoxNews; that Border crossings are virtually nonexistent under the Trump Administration. In past years; under Sleepy Joe; MILLIONS OF PEOPLE POURED INTO OUR COUNTRY; totally unchecked and unvetted. Also; crime numbers are now down to lowest numbers!!!
0,WOW!
0,Alex Swoyer has written a powerful Book; “Lawless Lawfare: Tipping the Scales of Justice to Get Trump and Destroy MAGA.” The unprecedented Weaponization of “Justice” by the Democrats against their Political Opponent (ME!) can never be forgotten; or allowed to happen again. Read this Book; and remember what the Radical Left Democrats are capable of; and what we overcame through sheer Grit; Wisdom; and Courage. Get your copy today:https://www.amazon.com/Lawless-Lawfare-Tipping-Justice-Destroy/dp/B0FCYKGK7L
0,Good News! George and Amal Clooney; two of the worst political prognosticators of all time; have officially become citizens of France which is; sadly; in the midst of a major crime problem because of their absolutely horrendous handling of immigration; much like we had under Sleepy Joe Biden. Remember when Clooney; after the now infamous debate; dumped Joe during a fundraiser; only to go onto the side of another stellar candidate; Jamala(K!); who is now fighting it out with the worst governor in the Country; including Tim Waltz; Gavin Newscum; for who is going to lead the Democrats to their future defeat. Clooney got more publicity for politics than he did for his very few; and totally mediocre; movies. He wasn’t a movie star at all; he was just an average guy who complained; constantly; about common sense in politics. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
0,We are removing the National Guard from Chicago; Los Angeles; and Portland; despite the fact that CRIME has been greatly reduced by having these great Patriots in those cities; and ONLY by that fact. Portland; Los Angeles; and Chicago were GONE if it weren’t for the Federal Government stepping in. We will come back; perhaps in a much different and stronger form; when crime begins to soar again - Only a question of time! It is hard to believe that these Democrat Mayors and Governors; all of whom are greatly incompetent; would want us to leave; especially considering the great progress that has been made??? President DJT
0,The Democrats are a bunch of cheaters and thieves that never want to do what’s good for America. As an example; they refuse to even consider Voter Identification. Why??? Because they want to cheat; and the Republicans should not put up with this; and many other such things; any longer!!!
0,Republicans: No more money to Fat Cat Insurance Companies. The money must go directly to the people to buy their own Healthcare. President DJT
0,The United States has set a World Record on investments being made into a Country; and it is Trillions of Dollars more than number two; China. This is singularly because of TARIFFS; and the fact that if you make your product in the U.S.; there ARE NO TARIFFS. Hence; factories and businesses are being built all over our Country - At a level never seen before. Congrats to the USA on this incredible achievement!!! President DJT

0,God Bless Tina Peters; who is now; for two years out of nine; sitting in a Colorado Maximum Security Prison; at the age of 73; and sick; for the “crime” of trying to stop the massive voter fraud that goes on in her State (where people are leaving in record numbers!). Hard to wish her a Happy New Year; but to the Scumbag Governor; and the disgusting “Republican” (RINO!) DA; who did this to her (nothing happens to the Dems and their phony Mail In Ballot System that makes it impossible for a Republican to win an otherwise very winnable State!); I wish them only the worst. May they rot in Hell. FREE TINA PETERS!
0,Much of the Minnesota Fraud; up to 90%; is caused by people that came into our Country; illegally; from Somalia. “Congresswoman” Omar; an ungrateful loser who only complains and never contributes; is one of the many scammers. Did she really marry her brother? Lowlifes like this can only be a liability to our Country’s greatness. Send them back from where they came; Somalia; perhaps the worst; and most corrupt; country on earth. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!
0,There is more FRAUD in California than there is in Minnesota; if that is even possible. When you add in Election Fraud; then they are tied for first. Two Crooked Governors; two Crooked States!
0,Tim Waltz of Minnesota is a Crooked Governor!!!
0,California and Colorado are two of the TOP OUTBOUND STATES IN 2025 (United Van Lines!) - In other words; PEOPLE LEAVING!!! That’s what bad governors do to even places blessed with beautiful surrounds and climate. President DJT
0,Paul Perez and the Border Patrol have done a fantastic job; and so proud that more than half are of Hispanic heritage; which Los Angeles’ incompetent Mayor; Karen Bass (who hasn’t even gotten the permits for people rebuilding their homes after the record setting fire that took place); and other Third Rate Politicians; are complaining about. Our Enlistment Numbers are at RECORDS; and we’ll keep it that way. There is no group I am more proud of than Border Patrol and ICE; and nobody understands the Border better than our fantastic Hispanic population; which continues to; MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
0,The polls are rigged even more than the writers. The real number is 64%; and why not; our Country is “hotter” than ever before. Isn’t it nice to have a STRONG BORDER; No Inflation; a powerful Military; and great Economy??? Happy New Year!

0,I am pleased to announce that the breakout fighting between Thailand and Cambodia will stop momentarily; and they will go back to living in PEACE; as per our recently agreed to original Treaty. I want to congratulate both great leaders on their brilliance in coming to this rapid and very fair conclusion. It was FAST &amp; DECISIVE; as all of these situations should be! The United States of America; as always; was proud to help! With all of the wars and conflicts I have settled and stopped over the last eleven months; EIGHT; perhaps the United States has become the REAL United Nations; which has been of very little assistance or help in any of them; including the disaster currently going on between Russia and Ukraine. The United Nations must start getting active and involved in WORLD PEACE!

0,Merry Christmas to all; including the many Sleazebags who loved Jeffrey Epstein; gave him bundles of money; went to his Island; attended his parties; and thought he was the greatest guy on earth; only to “drop him like a dog” when things got too HOT; falsely claimed they had nothing to do with him; didn’t know him; said he was a disgusting person; and then blame; of course; President Donald J. Trump; who was actually the only one who did drop Epstein; and long before it became fashionable to do so. When their names get brought out in the ongoing Radical Left Witch Hunt (plus one lowlife “Republican;” Massie!); and it is revealed that they are Democrats all; there will be a lot of explaining to do; much like there was when it was made public that the Russia; Russia; Russia Hoax was a fictitious story - a total Scam -and had nothing to do with “TRUMP.” The Failing New York Times; among many others; was forced to apologize for their bad and faulty Election “Reporting;” even to the point of losing many subscribers due to their highly inaccurate (FAKE!) coverage. Now the same losers are at it again; only this time so many of their friends; mostly innocent; will be badly hurt and reputationally tarnished. But sadly; that’s the way it is in the World of Corrupt Democrat Politics!!! Enjoy what may be your last Merry Christmas! President Donald J. Trump
0,Tonight; at my direction as Commander in Chief; the United States launched a powerful and deadly strike against ISIS Terrorist Scum in Northwest Nigeria; who have been targeting and viciously killing; primarily; innocent Christians; at levels not seen for many years; and even Centuries! I have previously warned these Terrorists that if they did not stop the slaughtering of Christians; there would be hell to pay; and tonight; there was. The Department of War executed numerous perfect strikes; as only the United States is capable of doing. Under my leadership; our Country will not allow Radical Islamic Terrorism to prosper. May God Bless our Military; and MERRY CHRISTMAS to all; including the dead Terrorists; of which there will be many more if their slaughter of Christians continues. DONALD J. TRUMPPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

0,Highly Respected Congresswoman; Harriet Hageman; is running for the United States Senate in the Great State of Wyoming; a place I love and WON BIG in 2016; 2020; and 2024! I know Harriet well; and she is a TOTAL WINNER! Harriet has ALWAYS delivered for Wyoming; and will continue to do so in the United States Senate. She will fight tirelessly to Grow our Economy; Cut Taxes and Regulations; Promote MADE IN THE U.S.A.; Advance American Energy DOMINANCE; Champion our Amazing Farmers and Ranchers; Keep our Border SECURE; Stop Migrant Crime; Support our Incredible Military/Veterans; and Defend our always under siege Second Amendment. Harriet Hageman has my Complete and Total Endorsement to be your next Senator — SHE WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN!
0,THE TRUMP RULE:The Financial News today was great — GDP up 4.2% as opposed to the predicted 2.5% (and this; despite the downward pressure of the recent Democrat Shutdown!) — But in the Modern Market; when you have good news; the Market stays even; or goes down; because Wall Street’s “heads” are wired differently than they used to be. In the old days; when there was good news; the Market went up. Nowadays; when there is good news; the Market goes down; because everybody thinks that Interest Rates will be immediately lifted to take care of “potential” Inflation. That means that; essentially; we can never have a Great Market again; those Markets from the time when our Nation was building up; and becoming great. Strong Markets; even phenomenal Markets; don’t cause Inflation; stupidity does! I want my new Fed Chairman to lower Interest Rates if the Market is doing well; not destroy the Market for no reason whatsoever. I want to have a Market the likes of which we haven’t had in many decades; a Market that goes up on good news; and down on bad news; the way it should be; and the way it was. Inflation will take care of itself and; if it doesn’t; we can always raise Rates at the appropriate time — But the appropriate time is not to kill Rallies; which could lift our Nation by 10; 15; and even 20 GDP points in a year — and maybe even more than that! A Nation can never be Economically GREAT if “eggheads” are allowed to do everything within their power to destroy the upward slope. We are going to be encouraging the Good Market to get better; rather than make it impossible for it to do so. We are going to see numbers that are far more natural; and far better; than they have ever been before. We are going to; MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! The United States should be rewarded for SUCCESS; not brought down by it. Anybody that disagrees with me will never be the Fed Chairman!
0,Q3 GDP came in at 4.3%; BLOWING PAST expectations of 3.2%. 60 of 61 Bloomberg Economists got it WRONG; but “TRUMP;” and some other Geniuses; got it right. The SUCCESS is due to Good Government; and TARIFFS. Consumer spending is STRONG; Net Exports are WAY UP; Imports and Trade Deficits are WAY DOWN; and there is NO INFLATION! Because of my Tax Bill (THE GREAT BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL) and TARIFFS; INVESTMENT IS SETTING RECORDS. The Trump Economic Golden Age is FULL steam ahead — “You haven’t seen anything yet!” Thank you for your attention to this matter. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! DONALD J. TRUMPPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

Tremendous announcement today; in the White House; on “Most Favored Nation” Drug Pricing. There has never been anything like it in the Medical World. Prices are now dropping at levels never seen before. This alone should win the Midterms for Republicans! No Democrat could have come close to doing it.

We are striking very strongly against ISIS strongholds in Syria; a place soaked in blood which has many problems; but one that has a bright future if ISIS can be eradicated.

0,Raphael Warnock was on Meet the Fake Press with a one sided and very biased Kristen Welker as the Host(ess!). Warnock spent the entire show using Religion to try and divide the Country! If a Republican; in particular ME; made those statements; it would be FRONT PAGE NEWS. He ended by saying that he was going to his Church to preach now; and while I think that’s fine; I do say; “What ever happened to separation of Church and State?” That would be the first thing they would use against us but; actually; it’s something that never much bothered me. Anyway; Warnock is a LIGHTWEIGHT whose wife correctly states that he tried to run her over with a car. Fortunately; she was able to get out of the way; and only almost lost her foot. Warnock is a bad guy; and NBC News; which is second only to ABC Fake News for being the worst; should be ashamed of themselves in allowing garbage “interviews” with untalented and uncaring people to take place. The Public airwaves; which these Networks are using at no charge; should not be allowed to get away with this any longer! They should be properly licensed; and pay significant amounts of money for using this very valuable Public space. Thank you for your attention to this matter. MAGA!

0,Today; I am proud to announce my nomination of Troy Edgar as the next United States Ambassador to El Salvador. Since returning to DHS on January 20th; Troy has shown outstanding leadership; delivering strong results in protecting our Homeland; and supporting our America First Agenda. His experience; discipline; and deep understanding of Border Security and Western Hemisphere challenges make him the PERFECT choice for this critical post. El Salvador is one of our most important partners in the region. President Nayib Bukele has been a tremendous ally in the fight against Crime; Cartels; and Chaos; and together; we are building the safest and strongest neighborhood our hemisphere has ever seen. Troy will play a key role in advancing our Western Hemisphere strategy; strengthening cooperation with President Bukele; and ensuring the Safety and Prosperity of BOTH our Nations — A big step toward restoring American Strength across Latin America!
0,Venezuela is completely surrounded by the largest Armada ever assembled in the History of South America. It will only get bigger; and the shock to them will be like nothing they have ever seen before — Until such time as they return to the United States of America all of the Oil; Land; and other Assets that they previously stole from us. The illegitimate Maduro Regime is using Oil from these stolen Oil Fields to finance themselves; Drug Terrorism; Human Trafficking; Murder; and Kidnapping. For the theft of our Assets; and many other reasons; including Terrorism; Drug Smuggling; and Human Trafficking; the Venezuelan Regime has been designated a FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATION. Therefore; today; I am ordering A TOTAL AND COMPLETE BLOCKADE OF ALL SANCTIONED OIL TANKERS going into; and out of; Venezuela. The Illegal Aliens and Criminals that the Maduro Regime has sent into the United States during the weak and inept Biden Administration; are being returned to Venezuela at a rapid pace. America will not allow Criminals; Terrorists; or other Countries; to rob; threaten; or harm our Nation and; likewise; will not allow a Hostile Regime to take our Oil; Land; or any other Assets; all of which must be returned to the United States; IMMEDIATELY. Thank you for your attention to this matter!DONALD J. TRUMPPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

Rob Reiner; a tortured and struggling; but once very talented movie director and comedy star; has passed away; together with his wife; Michele; reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive; unyielding; and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME; sometimes referred to as TDS. He was known to have driven people CRAZY by his raging obsession of President Donald J. Trump; with his obvious paranoia reaching new heights as the Trump Administration surpassed all goals and expectations of greatness; and with the Golden Age of America upon us; perhaps like never before. May Rob and Michele rest in peace!

0,RT @PressSecWe know that Americans are still hurting from the 40-year high inflation caused by Joe Biden and the Democrats; but President Trump is making significant progress to fix it; and he won’t stop working until he solves it:✅The latest jobs report showed the American economy remains strong with 119;000 new jobs added – more than double expectations. In particular; construction jobs surged by 19;000 in the month of September; the largest monthly gain in a year.✅Inflation remains under control and real wages are on pace to increase roughly $1;200 for the average worker. This is a complete reversal of the failed Biden era where we saw inflation skyrocket to 9%; causing private sector workers to see their real wages decline by approximately $3;000 dollars.✅Since President Trump took office; all employment gains have gone to native-born workers rather than foreigners like we saw under Biden.Trust in Trump.

They have agreed to CEASE all shooting effective this evening; and go back to the original Peace Accord made with me; and them; with the help of the Great Prime Minister of Malaysia; Anwar Ibrahim. The roadside bomb that originally killed and wounded numerous Thai Soldiers was an accident; but Thailand nevertheless retaliated very strongly. Both Countries are ready for PEACE and continued Trade with the United States of America. It is my Honor to work with Anutin and Hun in resolving what could have evolved into a major War between two otherwise wonderful and prosperous Countries! I would also like to thank the Prime Minister of Malaysia; Anwar Ibrahim; for his assistance in this very important matter.
0,For years; Democrats ignored Violent and Vicious Crime of all shapes; sizes; colors; and types. Violent Criminals who should have been locked up were allowed to attack again. Democrats were also far too happy to let in the worst from the worst countries so they could rip off American Taxpayers. Democrats only think there is one crime – Not voting for them! Instead of protecting Americans and their Tax Dollars; Democrats chose instead to prosecute anyone they can find that wanted Safe and Secure Elections. Democrats have been relentless in their targeting of TINA PETERS; a Patriot who simply wanted to make sure that our Elections were Fair and Honest. Tina is sitting in a Colorado prison for the “crime” of demanding Honest Elections. Today I am granting Tina a full Pardon for her attempts to expose Voter Fraud in the Rigged 2020 Presidential Election!
0,The Wall Street Journal has another ridiculous story today that China is dominating us; and the World; on the production of Electricity having to do with AI. They’re WRONG; as usual! Every AI plant being built in the United States is building its own Electric Generating Facilities. The approvals are being given carefully; but very quickly; a matter of weeks. Any excess Electricity being produced is going to our Electric Grid; which is being strengthened; and expanded; for other purposes than AI; like never before. In other words; AI has far more Electricity than they will ever need because; they are building the facilities that produce it; themselves. We are leading the World in AI; BY FAR; because of a gentleman named DONALD J. TRUMP!
0,I inherited a MESS from the Biden Administration — The Worst Inflation in History; and the Highest Prices our Country has ever seen. In other words; Affordability; just 13 months ago; was a DISASTER for the American People; but now; it’s totally different! Prices are coming down FAST; Energy; Oil and Gasoline; are hitting five year lows; and the Stock Market today just hit an All Time High. Tariffs are bringing in Hundreds of Billions of Dollars; and we are respected as a Nation again. When will I get credit for having created; with No Inflation; perhaps the Greatest Economy in the History of our Country? When will people understand what is happening? When will Polls reflect the Greatness of America at this point in time; and how bad it was just one year ago?

Importantly; it now has a chance to make a difference in Washington; D.C.; in regard to the number of House seats we have that are necessary to hold the Majority against the Radical Left Democrats. Every other State has done Redistricting; willingly; openly; and easily. There was never a question in their mind that contributing to a WIN in the Midterms for the Republicans was a great thing to do for our Party; and for America itself. In all fairness; the Democrats have been doing Redistricting for years; and continue to do so. Unfortunately; Indiana Senate “Leader” Rod Bray enjoys being the only person in the United States of America who is against Republicans picking up extra seats; in Indiana’s case; two of them. He is putting every ounce of his limited strength into asking his soon to be very vulnerable friends to vote with him. By doing so; he is putting the Majority in the House of Representatives; Washington; D.C.; at risk and; at the same time; putting anybody in Indiana who votes against this Redistricting; likewise; at risk. The people of Indiana don’t want the Party of Sleepy Joe Biden; Kamala; Ilhan Omar; or the rest to succeed in Washington. Bray doesn’t care. He’s either a bad guy; or a very stupid one! In any event; he and a couple of his friends will partner with the Radical Left Democrats. They found some Republican “SUCKERS;” and they couldn’t be happier that they did! Guys like Failed Senate Candidate Mitch Daniels; who I opposed in his Race against Senator Jim Banks; and Cam Savage; whoever that is; are fighting against the Republican Party; all the way. Bray and his friends are the favorite Republicans of Hakeem Jeffries; Crazy Nancy Pelosi; and Cryin’ Chuck Schumer. Anybody that votes against Redistricting; and the SUCCESS of the Republican Party in D.C.; will be; I am sure; met with a MAGA Primary in the Spring. If Republicans will not do what is necessary to save our Country; they will eventually lose everything to the Democrats. Rod Bray and his friends won’t be in Politics for long; and I will do everything within my power to make sure that they will not hurt the Republican Party; and our Country; again. One of my favorite States; Indiana; will be the only State in the Union to turn the Republican Party down!

0,State Senator Phil Berger is an America First Patriot; who is doing an incredible job representing North Carolina’s 26th Senate District! Phil Berger has served as the Highly Respected Leader of the North Carolina Senate for over a decade; helping us deliver massive and historic Victories across the State; including my six BIG WINS and Primaries in 2016; 2020; and 2024! As Senate Leader; Phil is fighting tirelessly to Grow the Economy; Cut Taxes and Regulations; Advance MADE IN THE U.S.A.; Unleash American Energy DOMINANCE; Champion School Choice; Support our Great Military; Veterans; and Law Enforcement; Keep our now very Secure Border; SECURE; Stop Migrant Crime; and Protect our always under siege Second Amendment. He is also endorsed by Senator Ted Budd; and Representatives Virginia Foxx; Addison McDowell; David Rouzer; and many other MAGA Warriors. Sam Page is GREAT; he has been a longtime supporter; but I really want him to come work for us in Washington; D.C.; rather than further considering a run against Phil — Both are such outstanding people! Therefore; Phil Berger has my Complete and Total Endorsement for Re-Election — HE WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN!

0,RT @realDonaldTrumpThere has never been a President that has worked as hard as me! My hours are the longest; and my results are among the best. I’ve stopped Eight Wars; saving many millions of lives in the process; created the Greatest Economy in the History of our Country; brought Business back into the United States at levels never seen before; rebuilt our Military; created the Largest Tax Cuts and Regulation Cuts; EVER; closed our open and very dangerous Southern Border; when previous Administrations were unable to do so; and created an “aura” around the United States of America that has led every Country in the World to respect us more than ever before. In addition to all of that; I go out of my way to do long; thorough; and very boring Medical Examinations at the Great Walter Reed National Military Medical Center; seen and supervised by top doctors; all of whom have given me PERFECT Marks — Some have even said they have never seen such Strong Results. I do these Tests because I owe it to our Country. In addition to the Medical; I have done something that no other President has done; on three separate occasions; the last one being recently; by taking what is known as a Cognitive Examination; something which few people would be able to do very well; including those working at The New York Times; and I ACED all three of them in front of large numbers of doctors and experts; most of whom I do not know. I have been told that few people have been able to “ace” this Examination and; in fact; most do very poorly; which is why many other Presidents have decided not to take it at all. Despite all of this; the time and work involved; The New York Times; and some others; like to pretend that I am “slowing up;” am maybe not as sharp as I once was; or am in poor physical health; knowing that it is not true; and knowing that I work very hard; probably harder than I have ever worked before. I will know when I am “slowing up;” but it’s not now! After all of the work I have done with Medical Exams; Cognitive Exams; and everything else; I actually believe it’s seditious; perhaps even treasonous; for The New York Times; and others; to consistently do FAKE reports in order to libel and demean  “THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.” They are true Enemies of the People; and we should do something about it. They have inaccurately reported on all of my Election Results and; in fact; were forced to apologize on much of what they wrote. The best thing that could happen to this Country would be if The New York Times would cease publication because they are a horrible; biased; and untruthful “source” of information. Thank you for your attention to this matter. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

0,Because of Tariffs; easily and quickly applied; our National Security has been greatly enhanced; and we have become the financially strongest Country; by far; anywhere in the World. Only dark and sinister forces would want to see that end!!!
0,The biggest threat in history to United States National Security would be a negative decision on Tariffs by the U.S. Supreme Court. We would be financially defenseless. Now Europe is going to Tariffs against China; as they already do against others. We would not be allowed to do what others already do!https://justthenews.com/government/diplomacy/european-countries-threaten-tariffs-china-following-trump-trade-deficits
0,Mexico continues to violate our comprehensive Water Treaty; and this violation is seriously hurting our BEAUTIFUL TEXAS CROPS AND LIVESTOCK. Mexico still owes the U.S over 800;000 acre-feet of water for failing to comply with our Treaty over the past five years. The U.S needs Mexico to release 200;000 acre-feet of water before December 31st; and the rest must come soon after. As of now; Mexico is not responding; and it is very unfair to our U.S. Farmers who deserve this much needed water. That is why I have authorized documentation to impose a 5% Tariff on Mexico if this water isn’t released; IMMEDIATELY. The longer Mexico takes to release the water; the more our Farmers are hurt. Mexico has an obligation to FIX THIS NOW. Thank you for your attention to this matter!
0,I have informed President Xi; of China; that the United States will allow NVIDIA to ship its H200 products to approved customers in China; and other Countries; under conditions that allow for continued strong National Security. President Xi responded positively! $25% will be paid to the United States of America. This policy will support American Jobs; strengthen U.S. Manufacturing; and benefit American Taxpayers. The Biden Administration forced our Great Companies to spend BILLIONS OF DOLLARS building “degraded” products that nobody wanted; a terrible idea that slowed Innovation; and hurt the American Worker. That Era is OVER! We will protect National Security; create American Jobs; and keep America’s lead in AI. NVIDIA’s U.S. Customers are already moving forward with their incredible; highly advanced Blackwell chips; and soon; Rubin; neither of which are part of this deal. My Administration will always put America FIRST. The Department of Commerce is finalizing the details; and the same approach will apply to AMD; Intel; and other GREAT American Companies.

0,The only reason Marjorie “Traitor” Brown (Green turns Brown under stress!) went BAD is that she was JILTED by the President of the United States (Certainly not the first time she has been jilted!). Too much work; not enough time; and her ideas are; NOW; really BAD - She sort of reminds me of a Rotten Apple! Marjorie is not AMERICA FIRST or MAGA; because nobody could have changed her views so fast; and her new views are those of a very dumb person. That was proven last night when washed up; Trump hating; 60 Minutes “correspondent;” Lesley Stahl; who still owes me an apology from when she attacked me on the show (with serious conviction!); that Hunter Biden’s LAPTOP FROM HELL was produced by Russia; not Hunter himself (TOTALLY PROVEN WRONG!); interviewed a very poorly prepared Traitor; who in her confusion made many really stupid statements. My real problem with the show; however; wasn’t the low IQ traitor; it was that the new ownership of 60 Minutes; Paramount; would allow a show like this to air. THEY ARE NO BETTER THAN THE OLD OWNERSHIP; who just paid me millions of Dollars for FAKE REPORTING about your favorite President; ME! Since they bought it; 60 Minutes has actually gotten WORSE! Oh well; far worse things can happen. P.S. I hereby demand a complete and total APOLOGY; though far too late to be meaningful; from Lesley Stahl and 60 Minutes for her incorrect and Libelous statements about Hunter’s Laptop!!! President DJT
0,There must be only One Rulebook if we are going to continue to lead in AI. We are beating ALL COUNTRIES at this point in the race; but that won’t last long if we are going to have 50 States; many of them bad actors; involved in RULES and the APPROVAL PROCESS. THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT ABOUT THIS! AI WILL BE DESTROYED IN ITS INFANCY! I will be doing a ONE RULE Executive Order this week. You can’t expect a company to get 50 Approvals every time they want to do something. THAT WILL NEVER WORK!
0,While the United States has other methods of charging TARIFFS against foreign countries; many of whom have; for YEARS; TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF OUR NATION; the current method of Tariffing before the United States Supreme Court is far more DIRECT; LESS CUMBERSOME; and MUCH FASTER; all ingredients necessary for A STRONG AND DECISIVE NATIONAL SECURITY RESULT. SPEED; POWER; AND CERTAINTY ARE; AT ALL TIMES; IMPORTANT FACTORS IN GETTING THE JOB DONE IN A LASTING AND VICTORIOUS MANNER. I have settled 8 Wars in 10 months because of the rights clearly given to the President of the United States. If countries didn’t think these rights existed; they would have said so; LOUD AND CLEAR!

0,RT @realDonaldTrumpCan you imagine??? The Democrats; under the Crooked Joe Biden Administration; who always use extreme force and jail-time to destroy their political opponent; wanted to put Congressman Henry Cuellar; and his wife; Imelda; in PRISON; for 15 years; which I predicted these Radical Left Lunatics would do - And they never stopped wanting to fulfill this evil quest! The Dems mercilessly went after Henry with everything they had! They were looking to destroy him; his lovely wife; his two young daughters; and anyone close to them. When the Democrats overwhelmingly lost the 2024 Presidential Election; and power with it; they; regardless; did everything they could to keep going after the Cuellar family. The Dems were vicious; and all because Henry strongly wanted; correctly; BORDER SECURITY! He was against illegals pouring into our Country; totally unchecked and unvetted. The Congressman didn’t want gang members; drug dealers; violent prisoners; people from mental institutions and yes; even murderers; in the good ol’ USA. It was all very unfair what they were doing to him and his family; so much so that his daughters wrote me a beautiful letter about their parents (Just posted on TRUTH!). After reading it I decided; in the interest of justice; and based on the daughter’s loving request; that I would give Henry and Imelda a Full and Complete Pardon. I never spoke to the Congressman; his wife; or his daughters; but felt very good about fighting for a family that was tormented by very sick and deranged people - They were treated sooo BADLY! I signed the papers; and said to people in the Oval Office that I just did a very good; perhaps life saving; thing. God was very happy with me that day! THEN IT HAPPENED!!! Only a short time after signing the Pardon; Congressman Henry Cuellar announced that he will be “running” for Congress again; in the Great State of Texas (a State where I received the highest number of votes ever recorded!); as a Democrat; continuing to work with the same Radical Left Scum that just weeks before wanted him and his wife to spend the rest of their lives in Prison - And probably still do! Such a lack of LOYALTY; something that Texas Voters; and Henry’s daughters; will not like. Oh’ well; next time; no more Mr. Nice guy! PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP

0,The Baseball Hall of Fame Committee is voting on admitting new Members TOMORROW; and these highly respected owners; executives; writers; and; most importantly; Hall of Famers; should do the right thing by finally putting Roger Clemens; known as “The Rocket;” in the Hall! Roger is clearly one of the Greatest Pitchers of All Time; with amazing achievements that include winning 354 Games; seven Cy Young Awards (A Record; by a lot!); and playing in six World Series; winning two. “The Rocket” is second only to another All Time GREAT; Hall of Famer Nolan Ryan; in most strike-outs. Roger Clemens is the only pitcher who has won 300 games to not have the honor of being enshrined in the Hall of Fame; which is a total travesty! The only reason he is not is because of rumors and innuendo; which were not proven. He never tested positive and; when the Obama DOJ went after him in a criminal case claiming that he did take steroids; Roger; who has always denied taking any drugs; was FULLY ACQUITTED OF ALL CHARGES. “The Rocket;” a nickname he earned very early in his career because of his blazing fastball; was just as dominant before those erroneous allegations were leveled against him. I sincerely hope that the Committee uses its great judgment (Roger’s opponents never proved a thing against him; and he may have the best pitching record; all told; in the History of Baseball!); and the Baseball Commissioner has the Strength; Wisdom; and Power to do the right thing; and put Roger Clemens in The Baseball Hall of Fame; IMMEDIATELY! Thank you for your attention to this matter. President DJT

0,Today; the CDC Vaccine Committee made a very good decision to END their Hepatitis B Vaccine Recommendation for babies; the vast majority of whom are at NO RISK of Hepatitis B; a disease that is mostly transmitted sexually; or through dirty needles. The American Childhood Vaccine Schedule long required 72 “jabs;” for perfectly healthy babies; far more than any other Country in the World; and far more than is necessary. In fact; it is ridiculous! Many parents and scientists have been questioning the efficacy of this “schedule;” as have I! That is why I have just signed a Presidential Memorandum directing the Department of Health and Human Services to “FAST TRACK” a comprehensive evaluation of Vaccine Schedules from other Countries around the World; and better align the U.S. Vaccine Schedule; so it is finally rooted in the Gold Standard of Science and COMMON SENSE!

0,The SLEAZEBAG Governor of Colorado; Jared Polis; refuses to allow an elderly woman; Tina Peters; who was unfairly convicted of what the Democrats do; cheating on Elections; out of jail! She was convicted for trying to stop Democrats from stealing Colorado Votes in the Election. She was preserving Election Records; which she was obligated to do under Federal Law. She has now served more than one year in jail; and has eight years to go. On top of everything else; she is a cancer “survivor.” This lightweight Governor; who has allowed his State to go to hell (Tren de Aragua; anyone?); should be ashamed of himself. FREE TINA!
0,For years; the Biden Administration weaponized the Justice System against their Political Opponents; and anyone who disagreed with them. One of the clearest examples of this was when Crooked Joe used the FBI and DOJ to “take out” a member of his own Party after Highly Respected Congressman Henry Cuellar bravely spoke out against Open Borders; and the Biden Border “Catastrophe.” Sleepy Joe went after the Congressman; and even the Congressman’s wonderful wife; Imelda; simply for speaking the TRUTH. It is unAmerican and; as I previously stated; the Radical Left Democrats are a complete and total threat to Democracy! They will attack; rob; lie; cheat; destroy; and decimate anyone who dares to oppose their Far Left Agenda; an Agenda that; if left unchecked; will obliterate our magnificent Country. Because of these facts; and others; I am hereby announcing my full and unconditional PARDON of beloved Texas Congressman Henry Cuellar; and Imelda. Henry; I don’t know you; but you can sleep well tonight — Your nightmare is finally over!

0,We had a very productive call with President Lula of Brazil. Among the things discussed were Trade; how our Countries could work together to stop Organized Crime; Sanctions imposed on various Brazilian dignitaries; Tariffs; and various other items. President Lula and I established a relationship at a meeting which took place at the United Nations; and I believe it set the stage for very good dialogue and agreement long into the future. I look forward to seeing and speaking with him soon. Much good will come out of this newly formed partnership!

0,Looks like Honduras is trying to change the results of their Presidential Election. If they do; there will be hell to pay! The people of Honduras voted in overwhelming numbers on November 30th. The National Electoral Commission; the official body charged with counting the Votes; abruptly stopped counting at midnight on November 30th. Their count showed a close race between Tito Asfura and Salvador Nasralla with Asfura holding a narrow lead of 500 votes. Their tally was stopped when only 47 percent of the Vote was counted. It is imperative that the Commission finish counting the Votes. Hundreds of thousands of Hondurans must have their Votes counted. Democracy must prevail!

0,Obama sycophant; the former Attorney General of the United States; who did so much to hurt our Country; and who weaponized the Obama Administration against the Republican Party (and ME!); Eric Holder (known as “FAST AND FURIOUS”) just gave a Speech where he emphatically stated; above all else; that Democrats will PACK the Supreme Court of the United States if they get the chance. The word is; he wants 21 Radical Left Activist Judges; not being satisfied with the heretofore 15 that they were seeking. It will be 21; they will destroy our Constitution; and there’s not a thing that the Republicans can do about it unless we TERMINATE THE FILIBUSTER; which will lead to an easy WIN of the Midterms; and an even easier WIN in the Presidential Election of 2028. Why would the Republicans even think about giving them this opportunity? The American People don’t want gridlock; they want their Leaders to GET THINGS DONE — TERMINATE THE FILIBUSTER; AND HAVE THE MOST SUCCESSFUL FOUR YEARS IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY; BY FAR; WITH NOT EVEN THE HINT OF A SHUTDOWN OF OUR GREAT NATION ON JANUARY 30TH!

0,The United States is very satisfied with the results displayed; through hard work and determination; in the Country of Syria. We are doing everything within our power to make sure the Government of Syria continues to do what was intended; which is substantial; in order to build a true and prosperous Country. One of the things that has helped them greatly was my termination of very strong and biting sanctions — I believe this was truly appreciated by Syria; its Leadership; and its People! It is very important that Israel maintain a strong and true dialogue with Syria; and that nothing takes place that will interfere with Syria’s evolution into a prosperous State. The new President of Syria; Ahmed al-Sharaa; is working diligently to make sure good things happen; and that both Syria and Israel will have a long and prosperous relationship together. This is a historic opportunity; and adds to the SUCCESS; already attained; for PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST!

0,Tariffs have made our Country Rich; Strong; Powerful; and Safe. They have been successfully used by other Countries against us for Decades; but when it comes to Tariffs; and because of what I have set in place; WE HAVE ALL THE CARDS; and with a smart President; we always will! Wars have been stopped; and stronger relationships with other countries have been built; even though they are not allowed to rip off the United States anymore. The Stock Market and 401k’s have hit an all time high; Inflation; Prices and Taxes are DOWN. Education is being brought back to the States (where it belongs!); and our Military; and Southern Border; is the strongest they have ever been. The USA is respected again; respected like never before. All of this was brought about by Strong Leadership and TARIFFS; without which we would be a poor and pathetic laughingstock again. Evil; American hating Forces are fighting us at the United States Supreme Court. Pray to God that our Nine Justices will show great wisdom; and do the right thing for America!

Tito will be a Great President; and the United States will work closely with him in order to ensure the success; with all of its potential; of Honduras! Additionally; I will be granting a Full and Complete Pardon to Former President Juan Orlando Hernandez who has been; according to many people that I greatly respect; treated very harshly and unfairly. This cannot be allowed to happen; especially now; after Tito Asfura wins the Election; when Honduras will be on its way to Great Political and Financial Success. VOTE FOR TITO ASFURA FOR PRESIDENT; AND CONGRATULATIONS TO JUAN ORLANDO HERNANDEZ ON YOUR UPCOMING PARDON. Thank you for your attention to this matter. MAKE HONDURAS GREAT AGAIN!PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP
0,Democracy is on trial in the coming Elections in the beautiful country of Honduras on November 30th. Will Maduro and his Narcoterrorists take over another country like they have taken over Cuba; Nicaragua; and Venezuela? The man who is standing up for Democracy; and fighting against Maduro; is Tito Asfura; the Presidential Candidate of the National Party. Tito was the highly successful Mayor of Tegucigalpa where he brought running water to millions; and paved hundreds of kilometers of roads. His chief opponent is Rixi Moncada; who says Fidel Castro is her idol. Normally; the smart people of Honduras; would reject her; and elect Tito Asfura; but the Communists are trying to trick the people by running a third Candidate; Salvador Nasralla. Nasralla is no friend of Freedom. A borderline Communist; he helped Xiomara Castro by running as her Vice President. He won; and helped Castro win. Then he resigned; and is now pretending to be an anti-Communist only for the purposes of splitting Asfura’s vote. The people of Honduras must not be tricked again. The only real friend of Freedom in Honduras is Tito Asfura. Tito and I can work together to fight the Narcocommunists; and bring needed aid to the people of Honduras. I cannot work with Moncada and the Communists; and Nasralla is not a reliable partner for Freedom; and cannot be trusted. I hope the people of Honduras vote for Freedom and Democracy; and elect Tito Asfura; President!

0,Any document signed by Sleepy Joe Biden with the Autopen; which was approximately 92% of them; is hereby terminated; and of no further force or effect. The Autopen is not allowed to be used if approval is not specifically given by the President of the UnitedStates. The Radical Left Lunatics circling Biden around the beautiful Resolute Desk in the Oval Office took the Presidency away from him. I am hereby cancelling all Executive Orders; and anything else that was not directly signed by Crooked Joe Biden; because the people who operated the Autopen did so illegally. Joe Biden was not involved in the Autopen process and; if he says he was; he will be brought up on charges of perjury. Thank you for your attention to this matter!

0,“Twilight’s Last Gleaming; Can America Be Saved” (YES!); by the Great Todd Starnes. A fantastic NEW BOOK. Get it now!!! President DJT
0,A very Happy Thanksgiving salutation to all of our Great American Citizens and Patriots who have been so nice in allowing our Country to be divided; disrupted; carved up; murdered; beaten; mugged; and laughed at; along with certain other foolish countries throughout the World; for being “Politically Correct;” and just plain STUPID; when it comes to Immigration. The official United States Foreign population stands at 53 million people (Census); most of which are on welfare; from failed nations; or from prisons; mental institutions; gangs; or drug cartels. They and their children are supported through massive payments from Patriotic American Citizens who; because of their beautiful hearts; do not want to openly complain or cause trouble in any way; shape; or form. They put up with what has happened to our Country; but it’s eating them alive to do so! A migrant earning $30;000 with a green card will get roughly $50;000 in yearly benefits for their family. The real migrant population is much higher. This refugee burden is the leading cause of social dysfunction in America; something that did not exist after World War II (Failed schools; high crime; urban decay; overcrowded hospitals; housing shortages; and large deficits; etc.). As an example; hundreds of thousands of refugees from Somalia are completely taking over the once great State of Minnesota. Somalian gangs are roving the streets looking for “prey” as our wonderful people stay locked in their apartments and houses hoping against hope that they will be left alone. The seriously retarded Governor of Minnesota; Tim Walz; does nothing; either through fear; incompetence; or both; while the worst “Congressman/woman” in our Country; Ilhan Omar; always wrapped in her swaddling hijab; and who probably came into the U.S.A. illegally in that you are not allowed to marry your brother; does nothing but hatefully complain about our Country; its Constitution; and how “badly” she is treated; when her place of origin is a decadent; backward; and crime ridden nation; which is essentially not even a country for lack of Government; Military; Police; schools; etc…
0,…Even as we have progressed technologically; Immigration Policy has eroded those gains and living conditions for many. I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover; terminate all of the millions of Biden illegal admissions; including those signed by Sleepy Joe Biden’s Autopen; and remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States; or is incapable of loving our Country; end all Federal benefits and subsidies to noncitizens of our Country; denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic tranquility; and deport any Foreign National who is a public charge; security risk; or non-compatible with Western Civilization. These goals will be pursued with the aim of achieving a major reduction in illegal and disruptive populations; including those admitted through an unauthorized and illegal Autopen approval process. Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation. Other than that; HAPPY THANKSGIVING TO ALL; except those that hate; steal; murder; and destroy everything that America stands for — You won’t be here for long!
0,This is part of the horrendous airlift from Afghanistan. Hundreds of thousands of people poured into our Country totally unvetted and unchecked. We will fix it; but will never forget what Crooked Joe Biden and his Thugs did to our Country!
0,Very sad to hear that the highly respected and beloved Professional Golfer; Fuzzy Zoeller; has passed away. In 1979; Fuzzy won the Masters Tournament (Only 1 of 3 to win in his first appearance!) and; in 1984; he won the U.S. Open at Winged Foot Golf Club; and famously waved the white towel on the 18th Hole as he went on to beat Greg Norman in an 18 Hole playoff. A truly remarkable person and player; he will be missed!

I; as President of the United States; and everyone associated with the Office of the Presidency; am with you!
0,The United States did not attend the G20 in South Africa; because the South African Government refuses to acknowledge or address the horrific Human Right Abuses endured by Afrikaners; and other descendants of Dutch; French; and German settlers. To put it more bluntly; they are killing white people; and randomly allowing their farms to be taken from them. Perhaps; worst of all; the soon to be out of business New York Times and the Fake News Media won’t issue a word against this genocide. That’s why all the Liars and Pretenders of the Radical Left Media are going out of business! At the conclusion of the G20; South Africa refused to hand off the G20 Presidency to a Senior Representative from our U.S. Embassy; who attended the Closing Ceremony. Therefore; at my direction; South Africa will NOT be receiving an invitation to the 2026 G20; which will be hosted in the Great City of Miami; Florida next year. South Africa has demonstrated to the World they are not a country worthy of Membership anywhere; and we are going to stop all payments and subsidies to them; effective immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter!
0,BREAKING NEWS! LAW and JUSTICE have prevailed in the Great State of Georgia; as the corrupt Fani Willis Witch Hunt against me; and other Great American Patriots; has been DISMISSED in its entirety. This Illegal; Unconstitutional; and unAmerican Hoax was perpetrated against our Nation by Fani and her Low I.Q. Lover; Nathan Wade; at the direction of Crooked Joe Biden and his “Handlers.” This case should have never been brought in the first place. The Radical and Unethical District Attorney illegally hired her boyfriend to “prosecute the Former President of the United States of America” in a charade; even though he had never prosecuted such a case before; was completely inexperienced in RICO; and blatantly lied about everything; including their “beautiful” love affair; the ridiculously high amounts of money she paid him (unlawfully taking it from the honest Taxpayers of Georgia); their record setting numbers of Caribbean cruises; vacations; and getaways; her clear Campaign Finance Violations and; most importantly; their obsession with doing anything and everything to “GET TRUMP;” just as the Biden White House told them to do. The Deranged Democrats did all they could to viciously attack me; my supporters; and our MAGA Movement; for telling the TRUTH — THE 2020 ELECTION WAS RIGGED AND STOLEN; and they committed Crime after Crime as they weaponized our Law Enforcement and Justice System against HONEST AND LOVING Americans but; we have fought back and won both in the Courts and Politically with our Historic; Country saving; Landslide Victory of November 5; 2024. We have to hold responsible those who attempted to destroy our Legal System and Nation itself as they tried to use it to silence and imprison Political Opponents for protecting our Country; and exercising our FIRST AMENDMENT Rights. The few remaining Democrat Witch Hunts will soon meet the same embarrassing end. We are going to keep winning; and continue to; MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

0,The Creeps at the Failing New York Times are at it again. I won the 2024 Presidential Election in a Landslide; winning all Seven Swing States; the Popular Vote; and the Electoral College by a lot. I won our Nation’s Districts by 2750 to 550; a complete wipeout. I settled 8 Wars; have 48 New Stock Market Highs; our Economy is Great; and our Country is RESPECTED AGAIN all over the World; respected like never before. The last Administration had the Highest Inflation in history - I have already brought that down to normal; and prices; including groceries; are coming down. To do this requires a lot of Work and Energy; and I have never worked so hard in my life. Yet despite all of this the Radical Left Lunatics in the soon to fold New York Times did a hit piece on me that I am perhaps losing my Energy; despite facts that show the exact opposite. They know this is wrong; as is almost every thing that they write about me; including election results; ALL PURPOSELY NEGATIVE. This cheap “RAG” is truly an “ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE.” The writer of the story; Katie Rogers; who is assigned to write only bad things about me; is a third rate reporter who is ugly; both inside and out. Despite all of this; I have my highest Poll Numbers; ever; and with record setting investment being made in America; they should only go up. There will be a day when I run low on Energy; it happens to everyone; but with a PERFECT PHYSICAL EXAM AND A COMPREHENSIVE COGNITIVE TEST (“That was aced”) JUST RECENTLY TAKEN; it certainly is not now! GOD BLESS AMERICA &amp; MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!

0,It looks like the Indiana Senate Republicans will be coming back in two weeks to take up Redistricting; a very important initiative to balance out the Democrats’ endless “Sue to Blue” and Census rigging strategy that has stolen seats from Republicans; and given them to Democrats who would not have them if they played fairly. Radical Left Democrats have rigged the game for a long time — Remember; until the GREAT Speaker Newt Gingrich; Democrats controlled the House for 40 YEARS in a row; and now; Republicans must fight back for the American People who want and need the Massive Tax and Regulation Cuts; Lower Prices; Strong Borders; Powerful Military; and Safe Cities that Republicans are delivering; and Democrats are fighting against every step of the way. Democrats; if they steal power back; will again give us the Highest Ever Inflation; Sky High Prices; Open Borders; Transgender for Everybody; DEI; and unlimited Violent Crime that they caused and allowed until we came back into Office this year. Republicans must do what is necessary to stop the destruction of our Country by these people who hate America; and are so ungrateful for the opportunities our Nation has given them. Our Country and Democracy is special; and we must do everything we possibly can to defend it from the Far Left infiltrators who want to destroy it. I am glad to hear the Indiana House is stepping up to do the right thing; and I hope the Senate finds the Votes. If they do; I will make sure that all of those people supporting me win their Primaries; and go on to Greatness but; if they don’t; I will partner with the incredibly powerful MAGA Grassroots Republicans to elect STRONG Republicans who are ready to do what is needed to protect our Country and; MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
0,Over the past week; my team has made tremendous progress with respect to ending the War between Russia and Ukraine (A War that would have NEVER started if I were President!). Last month 25;000 soldiers died. The original 28-Point Peace Plan; which was drafted by the United States; has been fine-tuned; with additional input from both sides; and there are only a few remaining points of disagreement. In the hopes of finalizing this Peace Plan; I have directed my Special Envoy Steve Witkoff to meet with President Putin in Moscow and; at the same time; Secretary of the Army Dan Driscoll will be meeting with the Ukrainians. I will be briefed on all progress made; along with Vice President JD Vance; Secretary of State Marco Rubio; Secretary of War Pete Hegseth; and White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles. I look forward to hopefully meeting with President Zelenskyy and President Putin soon; but ONLY when the deal to end this War is FINAL or; in its final stages. Thank you for your attention to this very important matter; and let’s all hope that PEACE can be accomplished AS SOON AS POSSIBLE! DONALD J. TRUMPPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

0,I just had a very good telephone call with President Xi; of China. We discussed many topics including Ukraine/Russia; Fentanyl; Soybeans and other Farm Products; etc. We have done a good; and very important; deal for our Great Farmers — and it will only get better. Our relationship with China is extremely strong! This call was a follow up to our highly successful meeting in South Korea; three weeks ago. Since then; there has been significant progress on both sides in keeping our agreements current and accurate. Now we can set our sights on the big picture. To that end; President Xi invited me to visit Beijing in April; which I accepted; and I reciprocated where he will be my guest for a State Visit in the U.S. later in the year. We agreed that it is important that we communicate often; which I look forward to doing. Thank you for your attention to this matter! DONALD J. TRUMPPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

0,Despite the massive amount of money being made by the United States of America; Hundreds of Billions of Dollars; as a direct result of Tariffs being charged to other countries; the full benefit of the Tariffs has not yet been calculated in that many of the buyers of goods and products; in order to avoid paying the Tariffs in the short term; “STOCK UP” by purchasing far more inventory than they can use. That heavy inventory purchase is now; however; wearing thin; and soon Tariffs will be paid on everything they apply to; without avoidance; and the amounts payable to the USA will SKYROCKET; over and above the already historic levels of dollars received. These payments will be RECORD SETTING; and put our Nation on a new and unprecedented course. We are already the “hottest” Country anywhere in the World; but this Tariff POWER will bring America National Security and Wealth the likes of which has never been seen before. Those opposing us are serving hostile foreign interests that are not aligned with the success; safety and prosperity of the USA. They couldn’t care less about us. I look so much forward to the United States Supreme Court’s decision on this urgent and time sensitive matter so that we can continue; in an uninterrupted manner to; MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

0,Jeffrey Epstein; who was charged by the Trump Justice Department in 2019 (Not the Democrats!); was a lifelong Democrat; donated Thousands of Dollars to Democrat Politicians; and was deeply associated with many well-known Democrat figures; such as Bill Clinton (who traveled on his plane 26 times); Larry Summers (who just resigned from many Boards; including Harvard); Sleazebag Political Activist Reid Hoffman; Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (who asked Epstein to donate to his Campaign AFTER Epstein was charged); Democrat Congresswoman Stacey Plaskett; and many more. Perhaps the truth about these Democrats; and their associations with Jeffrey Epstein; will soon be revealed; because I HAVE JUST SIGNED THE BILL TO RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES! As everyone knows; I asked Speaker of the House Mike Johnson; and Senate Majority Leader John Thune; to pass this Bill in the House and Senate; respectively. Because of this request; the votes were almost unanimous in favor of passage. At my direction; the Department of Justice has already turned over close to fifty thousand pages of documents to Congress. Do not forget — The Biden Administration did not turn over a SINGLE file or page related to Democrat Epstein; nor did they ever even speak about him. Democrats have used the “Epstein” issue; which affects them far more than the Republican Party; in order to try and distract from our AMAZING Victories; including THE GREAT BIG BEAUTIFUL TAX CUT BILL; Strong Borders; No Men in Women’s Sports or Transgender for Everyone; ending DEI; stopping Biden’s Record Setting Inflation; lowering Prices; Biggest Tax and Regulation Cuts in History; ending EIGHT Wars; rebuilding our Military; knocking out Iran’s Nuclear capability; getting Trillions of Dollars INVESTED in the U.S.A.; creating the “HOTTEST” Country anywhere in the World; and even delivering a HUGE DEFEAT to the Democrats on the recent Shutdown Disaster. For years our Great Nation has had to endure RUSSIA; RUSSIA; RUSSIA; UKRAINE; UKRAINE; UKRAINE; IMPEACHMENT HOAX #1; IMPEACHMENT HOAX #2; and many other Democrat created Witch Hunts and Scams; all of which have been so terrible and divisive for our Country; and have been done to confuse; deflect; and distract from the GREAT JOB that Republicans; and the Trump Administration; are doing. This latest Hoax will backfire on the Democrats just as all of the rest have! Thank you for your attention to this matter. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
0,Tremendous atrocities are taking place in Sudan. It has become the most violent place on Earth and; likewise; the single biggest Humanitarian Crisis. Food; doctors; and everything else are desperately needed. Arab Leaders from all over the World; in particular the highly respected Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia; who has just left the United States; have asked me to use the power and influence of the Presidency to bring an immediate halt to what is taking place in Sudan. It is considered a Great Civilization and Culture; unfortunately gone bad; but one that can be fixed with the cooperation and coordination of Countries; including those in the Region of tremendous Wealth; who want this to happen. We will work with Saudi Arabia; United Arab Emirates; Egypt; and other Middle Eastern partners to get these atrocities to end; while at the same time stabilizing Sudan.

0,As I said on Friday night aboard Air Force One to the Fake News Media; House Republicans should vote to release the Epstein files; because we have nothing to hide; and it’s time to move on from this Democrat Hoax perpetrated by Radical Left Lunatics in order to deflect from the Great Success of the Republican Party; including our recent Victory on the Democrat “Shutdown.” The Department of Justice has already turned over tens of thousands of pages to the Public on “Epstein;” are looking at various Democrat operatives (Bill Clinton; Reid Hoffman; Larry Summers; etc.) and their relationship to Epstein; and the House Oversight Committee can have whatever they are legally entitled to; I DON’T CARE! All I do care about is that Republicans get BACK ON POINT; which is the Economy; “Affordability” (where we are winning BIG!); our Victory on reducing Inflation from the highest level in History to practically nothing; bringing down prices for the American People; delivering Historic Tax Cuts; gaining Trillions of Dollars of Investment into America (A RECORD!); the rebuilding of our Military; securing our Border; deporting Criminal Illegal Aliens; ending Men in Women’s Sports; stopping Transgender for Everyone; and so much more! Nobody cared about Jeffrey Epstein when he was alive and; if the Democrats had anything; they would have released it before our Landslide Election Victory. Some “members” of the Republican Party are being “used;” and we can’t let that happen. Let’s start talking about the Republican Party’s Record Setting Achievements; and not fall into the Epstein “TRAP;” which is actually a curse on the Democrats; not us. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
0,Very disappointed in Indiana State Senate Republicans; led by RINO Senators Rod Bray and Greg Goode; for not wanting to redistrict their State; allowing the United States Congress to perhaps gain two more Republican seats. The Democrats have done redistricting for years; often illegally; and all other appropriate Republican States have done it. Because of these two politically correct type “gentlemen;” and a few others; they could be depriving Republicans of a Majority in the House; A VERY BIG DEAL! California is trying to pick up five seats; and no one is complaining about that. It’s weak “Republicans” that cause our Country such problems — It’s why we have crazy Policies and Ideas that are so bad for America. Also; a friend of mine; Governor Mike Braun; perhaps; is not working the way he should to get the necessary Votes. Considering that Mike wouldn’t be Governor without me (Not even close!); is disappointing! Any Republican that votes against this important redistricting; potentially having an impact on America itself; should be PRIMARIED. Indiana is a State with strong; smart; and patriotic people. They want us to see our Country WIN; and want to; “MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” Senators Bray; Goode; and the others to be released to the public later this afternoon; should DO THEIR JOB; AND DO IT NOW! If not; let’s get them out of office; ASAP.

Morgan; Chase; and many other people and institutions; to determine what was going on with them; and him. This is another Russia; Russia; Russia Scam; with all arrows pointing to the Democrats. Records show that these men; and many others; spent large portions of their life with Epstein; and on his “Island.” Stay tuned!!!

Some Weak Republicans have fallen into their clutches because they are soft and foolish. Epstein was a Democrat; and he is the Democrat’s problem; not the Republican’s problem!

Only a very bad; or stupid; Republican would fall into that trap. The Democrats cost our Country $1.5 Trillion Dollars with their recent antics of viciously closing our Country; while at the same time putting many at risk — and they should pay a fair price.

0,I am proud to announce that Chicago; Illinois; despite all of the radical opposition and obstruction we have from the Mayor and the Governor; has seen Car Theft; Shootings; Robberies; Violent Crime; and everything else; drop dramatically. Since the launch of the DHS operation “Midway Blitz” in Chicago only weeks ago; Shootings are down 35%; Robberies are down 41%; and Carjackings are down almost 50% — And this is with just a small initial Federal Force; not the full “surge” we have done in Chicago and Memphis. As we ramp up more assets; these numbers will continue to drop. This has been achieved despite the extraordinary resistance from Chicago and Illinois Radical Democrat “Leadership;” and the constant Violent Leftwing Terrorism against ICE Officers and Federal Agents that Insurrectionist Democrat Officials refuse to stop or prosecute; including constant physical assault and attempted assassination.

As Texas Chair of our Historic Presidential Campaigns in 2016; 2020; and 2024; Dan has been an incredible friend to our Movement; helping me to WIN BIG in all Primaries and General Elections! Dan’s leadership was pivotal in the passage of the new; fair; and much improved; Congressional Map; that will give the wonderful people of Texas the tremendous opportunity to elect 5 new MAGA Republicans in the 2026 Midterm Elections — A HUGE VICTORY for our America First Agenda. In his next Term; Dan will continue to fight tirelessly alongside of us to Secure our already Secure Border; Stop Migrant Crime and the Flow of Illegal Drugs into our Country; Grow the Economy; Cut Taxes and Regulations; Promote MADE IN THE U.S.A.; Restore American Energy DOMINANCE; Champion School Choice; Support our Military/Vets; and Strongly Protect our always under siege Second Amendment. A True Friend to MAGA from the very beginning; Dan Patrick has my Complete and Total Endorsement for Re-Election – HE WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN!

SEMPER FIDELIS. WE LOVE YOU ALL! DONALD J. TRUMPPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
0,The “Pay Back” Numbers being quoted by the Radical Left Lunatics; who would love to see us lose on Tariffs because of how bad it would be for our Country; are much higher than those being stated by our Fake Opposition — Opposition mainly from Foreign Countries that would do anything to be allowed to charge us Tariffs without retribution. The actual Number we would have to pay back in Tariff Revenue and Investments would be in excess of $2 Trillion Dollars; and that; in itself; would be a National Security catastrophe. Those opposed to us in the United States Supreme Court are giving low Numbers so that the Court will think it is easy to get out of this terrible situation that these Anarchists and Thugs have put us into!
0,All money left over from the $2000 payments made to low and middle income USA Citizens; from the massive Tariff Income pouring into our Country from foreign countries; which will be substantial; will be used to SUBSTANTIALLY PAY DOWN NATIONAL DEBT. Thank you for your attention to this matter! President DJT

Anyone who doesn’t will be substantially “docked.” For those Air Traffic Controllers who were GREAT PATRIOTS; and didn’t take ANY TIME OFF for the “Democrat Shutdown Hoax;” I will be recommending a BONUS of $10;000 per person for distinguished service to our Country. For those that did nothing but complain; and took time off; even though everyone knew they would be paid; IN FULL; shortly into the future; I am NOT HAPPY WITH YOU. You didn’t step up to help the U.S.A. against the FAKE DEMOCRAT ATTACK that was only meant to hurt our Country. You will have a negative mark; at least in my mind; against your record. If you want to leave service in the near future; please do not hesitate to do so; with NO payment or severance of any kind! You will be quickly replaced by true Patriots; who will do a better job on the Brand New State of the Art Equipment; the best in the World; that we are in the process of ordering. The last “Administration” wasted Billions of Dollars trying to fix antiquated “junk.” They had no idea what they were doing! Again; to our great American Patriots; GOD BLESS YOU - I won’t be able to send your money fast enough! To all others; REPORT TO WORK IMMEDIATELY. GOD BLESS AMERICA! PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP

0,RT @NewtGingrichThe New York Post report on the Nobel Peace Prize Winner dedicating her prize to President Trump may be a bigger honor than if the Committee had given the prize directly to the President. As the Post reported “ Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado on Friday said her historic Nobel Peace Prize isn’t just a victory for her embattled nation — it’s also a tribute to President Donald Trump; whose policies have “restored democracy and freedom in the Americas.”“I dedicated this award to the Venezuelan people and President Trump because I believe that’s absolutely fair. We; the Venezuelan people; are absolutely grateful to President Trump for the way he has supported democracy and freedom in the Americas.” Remember she is praising him for working on Venezuela while his public focus has been on Gaza and Ukraine. President Trump’s reach and ability to multitask is historic.

0,Senator Lindsey Graham: “The Schumer Shutdown is inflicting real pain on hardworking Americans. Senate Democrats need to stop playing political games; and reopen the Government now!”
0,“AUTOPEN”Sleepy Joe Biden was; by far; the worst President in American History. Taking office as a result of the most corrupt Election ever seen in the United States; Biden oversaw a series of unprecedented disasters that brought our Nation to the brink of destruction. His policies caused the highest Inflation ever recorded; leading the U.S. Dollar to lose more than 20% of its value in 4 years. His Green New Scam surrendered American Energy Dominance and; by abolishing the Southern Border; Biden let 21 million people from all over the World pour into the United States; including from prisons; jails; mental institutions; and insane asylums. His surrender in Afghanistan was among the most humiliating events in American History; and resulted in the murder of 13 brave American Servicemembers; with many others gravely wounded. Seeing Biden’s devastating weakness; Russia invaded Ukraine; and Hamas terrorists launched the heinous October 7th attack on Israel. Nicknamed both “Sleepy” and “Crooked;” Joe Biden was dominated by his radical handlers. They and their allies in the Fake News Media attempted to cover up his severe mental decline; and his unprecedented use of the Autopen. Following his humiliating debate loss to President Trump in the big June 2024 debate; he was forced to withdraw from his campaign for re-election in disgrace. Biden weaponized Law Enforcement against his political opponent; while also persecuting many other innocent people. He left office issuing blanket pardons to Radical Democrat criminals and thugs; as well as members of the Biden Crime Family — But despite it all; President Trump would get Re-Elected; and SAVE AMERICA!

0,This is who is getting your Healthcare Dollars!
0,Democrats claim to be working for “the little guy;” and driving down your Health Insurance; but the OBAMACARE SCAM goes STRAIGHT TO THEIR BEST FRIENDS IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY. THEY ARE MAKING A “KILLING;” while Health Coverage only gets WORSE. If Democrats get their way again; they’re in for another HUGE Payday at the expense of the American People. NO DEAL! Republicans should give money DIRECTLY to your personal HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNTS that I expanded in our GREAT BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL. Thank you for your attention to this matter!
0,I am sorry that the American People are being terrorized by Democrats who have decided to shut the Government down to make me and other Republicans continue ObamaCare subsidies; which have been a windfall for Health Insurance Companies; and a DISASTER for the American People. The largest Health Insurance Companies have seen their Stock Prices soar (Some over 1000%!) since the passage of ObamaCare. Meanwhile; Americans’ Premiums have more than DOUBLED; contrary to President Obama’s promise. I believe that the money should go directly to THE PEOPLE to purchase better Healthcare; and create competition. This enrichment of Health Insurance companies must stop. It is long past time to lower Premiums; not enrich Insurance Companies. I stand ready to work with both Parties to solve this problem once the Government is open. Stop terrorizing the American People. Stop pushing failed policies!

The President of the United States is allowed (and fully approved by Congress!) to stop ALL TRADE with a Foreign Country (Which is far more onerous than a Tariff!); and LICENSE a Foreign Country; but is not allowed to put a simple Tariff on a Foreign Country; even for purposes of NATIONAL SECURITY. That is NOT what our great Founders had in mind! The whole thing is ridiculous! Other Countries can Tariff us; but we can’t Tariff them??? It is their DREAM!!! Businesses are pouring into the USA ONLY BECAUSE OF TARIFFS. HAS THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT NOT BEEN TOLD THIS??? WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON???President DJT

In other words; take from the BIG; BAD Insurance Companies; give it to the people; and terminate; per Dollar spent; the worst Healthcare anywhere in the World; ObamaCare.

Now; the Leaders of this strategic Region; which is located at the crossroads of Europe; Asia; and the Middle East; and is blessed with ABUNDANT Critical Minerals; Hydrocarbons; and Human Talent; have a President of the United States of America who intends to be fully engaged! In commemoration of the 10 year anniversary of the C5+1 platform; we secured Billions of Dollars in Commercial Deals that will support tens of thousands of American jobs in the Aviation; Critical Minerals; Agriculture; Rail; Auto; and Technology sectors. Our Summit was the dawn of a beautiful; new relationship between the United States and Kazakhstan; Uzbekistan; Tajikistan; the Kyrgyz Republic; and Turkmenistan!

The Times totally misrepresented the facts; and didn’t cover the end result whereby China; very intelligently; pulled back their Rare Earths threat; bought Billions of Dollars of Soybeans and other Agricultural products; and agreed to pay substantial Tariffs. President Xi; a friend of mine; did the right thing for his Country; but I did the right thing for MINE. This was a Big Victory for the U.S.A. and; indeed; the World! Also; it was a wonderful outcome for China; and the fact that these two Major Powers left the meeting; as it began; with an excellent relationship; and specific plans for future talks and meetings. For The Failing New York Times to be trying to spin this Great Event negatively; when it was the exact opposite; is a disgrace to Journalism.

I am asking the DOJ to act expeditiously. Thank you for your attention to this matter!

0,Tomorrow’s United States Supreme Court case is; literally; LIFE OR DEATH for our Country. With a Victory; we have tremendous; but fair; Financial and National Security. Without it; we are virtually defenseless against other Countries who have; for years; taken advantage of us. Our Stock Market is consistently hitting Record Highs; and our Country has never been more respected than it is right now. A big part of this is the Economic Security created by Tariffs; and the Deals that we have negotiated because of them. Thank you for your attention to this matter!

0,The Unconstitutional Redistricting Vote in California is a GIANT SCAM in that the entire process; in particular the Voting itself; is RIGGED. All “Mail-In” Ballots; where the Republicans in that State are “Shut Out;” is under very serious legal and criminal review. STAY TUNED!
0,SNAP BENEFITS; which increased by Billions and Billions of Dollars (MANY FOLD!) during Crooked Joe Biden’s disastrous term in office (Due to the fact that they were haphazardly “handed” to anyone for the asking; as opposed to just those in need; which is the purpose of SNAP!); will be given only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government; which they can easily do; and not before! Thank you for your attention to this matter. President DJT

0,Any Jewish person that votes for Zohran Mamdani; a proven and self professed JEW HATER; is a stupid person!!!
0,The Democrats are far more likely to win the Midterms; and the next Presidential Election; if we don’t do the Termination of the Filibuster (The Nuclear Option!); because it will be impossible for Republicans to get Common Sense Policies done with these Crazed Democrat Lunatics being able to block everything by withholding their votes. FOR THREE YEARS; NOTHING WILL BE PASSED; AND REPUBLICANS WILL BE BLAMED.  Elections; including the Midterms; will be rightfully brutal. If we do terminate the Filibuster; we will get EVERYTHING approved; like no Congress in History. We will have FAIR; FREE; and SAFE Elections; No Men in Women’s Sports or Transgender for Everybody; Strong Borders; Major Tax and Energy Cuts; and will secure our Second Amendment; which the Democrats will also terminate; IMMEDIATELY. If we don’t do it; they are far more likely to do well in the upcoming Elections; which would mean a PACKED Supreme Court; 2 more States and 4 more Democrat Senators (D.C. and Puerto Rico); and 8 more Electoral Votes. Remember; Republicans; they are going to end the Filibuster as soon as they get the chance We know this because they already tried; and the only two people who didn’t go along are now out of office. But they have much less chance of WINNING if we have Great Policy Wins after Wins after Wins. IN FACT; THEY WILL LOSE BIG; AND FOR A VERY LONG TIME. TERMINATE THE FILIBUSTER NOW; END THE RIDICULOUS SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATELY; AND THEN; MOST IMPORTANTLY; PASS EVERY WONDERFUL REPUBLICAN POLICY THAT WE HAVE DREAMT OF; FOR YEARS; BUT NEVER GOTTEN. WE WILL BE THE PARTY THAT CANNOT BE BEATEN - THE SMART PARTY!!!
0,RT @realDonaldTrumpIf Communist Candidate Zohran Mamdani wins the Election for Mayor of New York City; it is highly unlikely that I will be contributing Federal Funds; other than the very minimum as required; to my beloved first home; because of the fact that; as a Communist; this once great City has ZERO chance of success; or even survival! It can only get worse with a Communist at the helm; and I don’t want to send; as President; good money after bad. It is my obligation to run the Nation; and it is my strong conviction that New York City will be a Complete and Total Economic and Social Disaster should Mamdani win. His principles have been tested for over a thousand years; and never once have they been successful. I would much rather see a Democrat; who has had a Record of Success; WIN; than a Communist with no experience and a Record of COMPLETE AND TOTAL FAILURE. He was nothing as an Assemblyman; ranked at the bottom of the class and; as Mayor of potentially; again; the Greatest City in the World; HE HAS NO CHANCE to bring it back to its former Glory! We must also remember this — A vote for Curtis Sliwa (who looks much better without the beret!) is a vote for Mamdani. Whether you personally like Andrew Cuomo or not; you really have no choice. You must vote for him; and hope he does a fantastic job. He is capable of it; Mamdani is not!
0,Virginia and New Jersey; VOTE REPUBLICAN IF YOU WANT MASSIVE ENERGY COST AND CRIME REDUCTIONS. The Democrats will double and even triple your Energy Costs; and CRIME will be rampant. A vote for the Democrats is a DEATH WISH! VOTE REPUBLICAN!!!
0,Why would anyone vote for New Jersey and Virginia Gubernatorial Candidates; Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger; when they want transgender for everybody; men playing in women’s sports; High Crime; and the most expensive Energy prices almost anywhere in the World? VOTE REPUBLICAN for massive Energy Cost reductions; large scale Tax Cuts; and basic Common Sense! Under President Trump; ME; Gasoline will come down to approximately $2 a Gallon; very soon! With the Democrats; you’ll be paying $4; $5; and $6 a Gallon; and your Electric and other Energy costs will; likewise; SOAR. VOTE REPUBLICAN FOR A GREAT AND VERY AFFORDABLE LIFE. All you’ll get from voting Democrat is unrelentingly High Crime; Energy prices through the roof; men playing in women’s sports; and HEARTACHE!
0,For all of those people voting in New Jersey and Virginia for Governor; Attorney General; or any other position; please remember this: A REPUBLICAN VOTE MEANS A DRASTIC DROP IN ENERGY PRICES AND ENERGY COSTS; A DROP LIKE YOU’VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE! — A DEMOCRAT VOTE MEANS A DOUBLING; AND EVEN TRIPLING; OF YOUR ENERGY BILLS AND PRICES; TRADITIONALLY THE HIGHEST COST OF AN AMERICAN CITIZEN! So; if you vote Republican; your Energy Costs are going to go down; tremendously! If you vote Democrat; your Energy Costs are going to go “through the roof;” making Energy virtually unaffordable for you and your family to pay. Also; remember; that if you don’t go to the Polls and VOTE; it’s the same thing as voting for a Democrat. SO; GO TO THE POLLS AND CUT YOUR ENERGY COSTS IN HALF!

0,VIRGINIA AND NEW JERSEY; REMEMBER THIS: A VOTE FOR A REPUBLICAN MEANS SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER ENERGY PRICES; A VOTE FOR A DEMOCRAT; ESPECIALLY THESE TWO LOSERS WHO ARE RUNNING; MEANS A DOUBLING; TRIPLING; AND EVEN QUADRUPLING OF YOUR ENERGY COSTS. IT WILL NOT BE SUSTAINABLE; AND YOU WILL RUE THE DAY THAT YOU VOTED TO DESTROY YOUR LIFE! FAILING TO VOTE TOMORROW IS THE SAME AS VOTING FOR A DEMOCRAT.

0,RT @PeteHegsethI just spoke to President Trump; and we agree — the relationship between the United States and China has never been better. Following President Trump’s historic meeting with Chairman Xi in South Korea; I had an equally positive meeting with my counterpart; China’s Minister of National Defense Admiral Dong Jun in Malaysia. And we spoke again last night. The Admiral and I agree that peace; stability; and good relations are the best path for our two great and strong countries. As President Trump said; his historic “G2 meeting” set the tone for everlasting peace and success for the U.S. and China. The Department of War will do the same — peace through strength; mutual respect; and positive relations. Admiral Dong and I also agreed that we should set up military-to-military channels to deconflict and deescalate any problems that arise. We have more meetings on that coming soon. God bless both China and the USA!

0,"Attention Pennsylvania: On November 4th; you can bring back the Rule of Law; and stand up for the Constitution. There are three Radical Democrat Supreme Court Justices on the Ballot for a 10 year retention. Vote “NO; NO; NO” on Liberal Justices Donohue; Dougherty; and Wecht. These activist Judges unlawfully gerrymandered your Congressional maps; which led to my corrupt Impeachment(s); and locked you up during COVID by closing your small businesses; schools; and churches. They let sex offenders out of prison; and ruled for Sleepy Joe Biden over and over; and interfered in the 2020 Election. It is time for Justice. Vote “NO; NO; NO"" on retention of these woke Judges."

0,The Orthodox Jewish communities all across America voted in very big numbers for me in our Historic 2024 Presidential Campaign. Lakewood; New Jersey; was one of our biggest Wins anywhere in the Country with more than 90% of the Vote. On November 4th; the eyes of the Country are on New Jersey again.

Jack will be a GREAT Governor; and has my Complete and Total Endorsement — He will never let you down! Jack needs every single Vote in the community; including all the Yeshiva students who turned out to vote for me last year. Your Votes in this Election will save New Jersey; a State that is near and dear to my heart. Jack will cut your taxes; and tremendously reduce your out of control and ridiculous Energy costs — whereas his opponent will double; triple; and even quadruple your Energy; and other costs. You will rue the day that you voted for her. VOTE FOR JACK CIATTARELLI ON TUESDAY; NOVEMBER 4TH!
0,Next week’s Case on Tariffs is one of the most important in the History of the Country. If a President is not allowed to use Tariffs; we will be at a major disadvantage against all other Countries throughout the World; especially the “Majors.” In a true sense; we would be defenseless! Tariffs have brought us Great Wealth and National Security in the nine months that I have had the Honor to serve as President. The Stock Market has hit All Time Highs many times during my short time in Office; with virtually No Inflation; and National Security that is second to none. Our recent successful negotiation with China; and many others; put us in a strong position only because we had Tariffs with which to negotiate fair and sustainable Deals. If a President was not able to quickly and nimbly use the power of Tariffs; we would be defenseless; leading perhaps even to the ruination of our Nation. The only people fighting us are Foreign Countries who for years have taken advantage of us; those who hate our Country and; the Democrats; because our numbers are insurmountably good. I will not be going to the Court on Wednesday in that I do not want to distract from the importance of this Decision. It will be; in my opinion; one of the most important and consequential Decisions ever made by the United States Supreme Court. If we win; we will be the Richest; Most Secure Country anywhere in the World; BY FAR. If we lose; our Country could be reduced to almost Third World status — Pray to God that that doesn’t happen!

0,Remember; Republicans; regardless of the Schumer Shutdown; the Democrats will terminate the Filibuster  the first chance they get.

We will immediately END the Extortionist Shutdown; get ALL of our agenda passed; and make life so good for Americans that these DERANGED DEMOCRAT politicians will never again have the chance to DESTROY AMERICA!

0,If the Nigerian Government continues to allow the killing of Christians; the U.S.A. will immediately stop all aid and assistance to Nigeria; and may very well go into that now disgraced country; “guns-a-blazing;” to completely wipe out the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities. I am hereby instructing our Department of War to prepare for possible action. If we attack; it will be fast; vicious; and sweet; just like the terrorist thugs attack our CHERISHED Christians! WARNING: THE NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT BETTER MOVE FAST!

0,Seth Meyers of NBC may be the least talented person to “perform” live in the history of television. In fact; he may be the WORST to perform; live or otherwise. I watched his show the other night for the first time in years. In it he talked endlessly about electric catapults on aircraft carriers which I complain about as not being as good as much less expensive steam catapults. On and on he went; a truly deranged lunatic. Why does NBC waste its time and money on a guy like this??? - NO TALENT; NO RATINGS; 100% ANTI TRUMP; WHICH IS PROBABLY ILLEGAL!!!
0,She should go back!

0,Our Government lawyers do not think we have the legal authority to pay SNAP with certain monies we have available; and now two Courts have issued conflicting opinions on what we can and cannot do. I do NOT want Americans to go hungry just because the Radical Democrats refuse to do the right thing and REOPEN THE GOVERNMENT. Therefore; I have instructed our lawyers to ask the Court to clarify how we can legally fund SNAP as soon as possible. It is already delayed enough due to the Democrats keeping the Government closed through the monthly payment date and; even if we get immediate guidance; it will unfortunately be delayed while States get the money out. If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court; it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding; just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay. The Democrats should quit this charade where they hurt people for their own political reasons; and immediately REOPEN THE GOVERNMENT. If you use SNAP benefits; call the Senate Democrats; and tell them to reopen the Government; NOW! Here is Cryin’ Chuck Schumer’s Office Number: (202) 224-6542
0,Christianity is facing an existential threat in Nigeria. Thousands of Christians are being killed. Radical Islamists are responsible for this mass slaughter. I am hereby making Nigeria a “COUNTRY OF PARTICULAR CONCERN” — But that is the least of it. When Christians; or any such group; is slaughtered like is happening in Nigeria (3;100 versus 4;476 Worldwide); something must be done! I am asking Congressman Riley Moore; together with Chairman Tom Cole and the House Appropriations Committee; to immediately look into this matter; and report back to me. The United States cannot stand by while such atrocities are happening in Nigeria; and numerous other Countries. We stand ready; willing; and able to save our Great Christian population around the World!DONALD J. TRUMP;PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
0,I just inspected the construction on The Kennedy Center. It is really looking good!

It is happening faster than anticipated; one of my trademarks. My people are doing a really great job! We are bringing this building back to life. It was dead as a doornail; but it will soon be beautiful again!
0,The Refurbished Lincoln Bathroom in the White House — Highly polished; Statuary marble!
0,I renovated the Lincoln Bathroom in the White House. It was renovated in the 1940s in an art deco green tile style; which was totally inappropriate for the Lincoln Era. I did it in black and white polished Statuary marble. This was very appropriate for the time of Abraham Lincoln and; in fact; could be the marble that was originally there!

0,I just got back from Asia where I met the Leaders of many Countries; including China; Japan; South Korea; Malaysia; Australia; Canada; New Zealand; Singapore; Thailand; Cambodia; Vietnam; and others. It was a Great Honor to meet them but; more particularly; to see that America is respected again — RESPECTED LIKE NEVER BEFORE! Great Trade Deals were made; Long Term relationships now exist; and money is pouring into our Country because of Tariffs and; frankly; the Landslide Results of the 2024 Presidential Election. The one question that kept coming up; however; was how did the Democrats SHUT DOWN the United States of America; and why did the powerful Republicans allow them to do it? The fact is; in flying back; I thought a great deal about that question; WHY? Majority Leader John Thune; and Speaker of the House Mike Johnson; are doing a GREAT job; but the Democrats are Crazed Lunatics that have lost all sense of WISDOM and REALITY. It is a sick form of the now “legendary” Trump Derangement Syndrome (TDS) that only comes from losing too much. They want Trillions of Dollars to be taken from our Healthcare System and given to others; who are not deserving — People who have come into our Country illegally; many from prisons and mental institutions. This will hurt American citizens; and Republicans will not let it happen. It is now time for the Republicans to play their “TRUMP CARD;” and go for what is called the Nuclear Option — Get rid of the Filibuster; and get rid of it; NOW! Just a short while ago; the Democrats; while in power; fought for three years to do this; but were unable to pull it off because of Senators Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. Never have the Democrats fought so hard to do something because they knew the tremendous strength that terminating the Filibuster would give them. They want to substantially expand (PACK!) the United States Supreme Court; make Washington; D.C. and Puerto Rico States (Thereby automatically picking up 4 Senate seats; many House seats; and at least 8 Electoral Votes!); and many other highly destructive things. Well; now WE are in power; and if we did what we should be doing; it would IMMEDIATELY end this ridiculous; Country destroying “SHUT DOWN.” If the Democrats ever came back into power; which would be made easier for them if the Republicans are not using the Great Strength and Policies made available to us by ending the Filibuster; the Democrats will exercise their rights; and it will be done in the first day they take office; regardless of whether or not we do it. In addition to all of the other things we would get; such as the best Judges; the best U.S. Attorneys; the best of everything; this was a concept from years ago of then President Barack Hussein Obama and former Majority Leader Harry Reid in order to take advantage of the Republicans. Now I want to do it in order to take advantage of the Democrats….

0,I had a truly great meeting with President Xi of China. There is enormous respect between our two Countries; and that will only be enhanced with what just took place. We agreed on many things; with others; even of high importance; being very close to resolved. I was extremely honored by the fact that President Xi authorized China to begin the purchase of massive amounts of Soybeans; Sorghum; and other Farm products. Our Farmers will be very happy! In fact; as I said once before during my first Administration; Farmers should immediately go out and buy more land and larger tractors. I would like to thank President Xi for this! Additionally; China has agreed to continue the flow of Rare Earth; Critical Minerals; Magnets; etc.; openly and freely. Very significantly; China has strongly stated that they will work diligently with us to stop the flow of Fentanyl into our Country. They will help us end the Fentanyl Crisis. China also agreed that they will begin the process of purchasing American Energy. In fact; a very large scale transaction may take place concerning the purchase of Oil and Gas from the Great State of Alaska. Chris Wright; Doug Burgum; and our respective Energy teams will be meeting to see if such an Energy Deal can be worked out. The agreements reached today will deliver Prosperity and Security to millions of Americans. After this Historic trip to Asia; I am now heading back to Washington; D.C. I want to thank the Great Countries of Malaysia; Japan; and South Korea for being so generous; gracious; and hospitable — Also; Australia; Canada; New Zealand; Singapore; Thailand; and Vietnam; who were at the Dinner last night hosted by His Excellency Lee Jae Myung. Hundreds of Billions of Dollars are being brought into our Country because of them. Our Nation is Strong; Respected; and Admired Again and; THE BEST IS YET TO COME!

Because of other countries testing programs; I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately.

Additionally; they have agreed to buy our Oil and Gas in vast quantities; and investments into our Country by wealthy South Korean Companies and Businessmen will exceed 600 Billion Dollars.

0,RT @SecWarYesterday; at the direction of President Trump; the Department of War carried out three lethal kinetic strikes on four vessels operated by Designated Terrorist Organizations (DTO) trafficking narcotics in the Eastern Pacific. The four vessels were known by our intelligence apparatus; transiting along known narco-trafficking routes; and carrying narcotics.Eight male narco-terrorists were aboard the vessels during the first strike. Four male narco-terrorists were aboard the vessel during the second strike. Three male narco-terrorists were aboard the vessel during the third strike. A total of 14 narco-terrorists were killed during the three strikes; with one survivor. All strikes were in international waters with no U.S. forces harmed.Regarding the survivor; USSOUTHCOM immediately initiated Search and Rescue (SAR) standard protocols; Mexican SAR authorities accepted the case and assumed responsibility for coordinating the rescue.The Department has spent over TWO DECADES defending other homelands. Now; we’re defending our own. These narco-terrorists have killed more Americans than Al-Qaeda; and they will be treated the same. We will track them; we will network them; and then; we will hunt and kill them.

People see how strong the Economy is; the Trillions of Dollars of Investment pouring into our Country; the Record Setting Strong Border (After years of millions of criminals pouring through it; totally unvetted and unchecked!); ending 8 wars in eight months; no men playing in women’s sports; no transgender for everyone; rapidly falling Energy prices; and much more! Despite all of this; the Radical Left Losers are taking fake ads; not showing REAL Polls; but rather saying that I’m Polling at low levels. These are the people that I’ve been beating for years; and am continuing to do so; but by even bigger margins. These ads should not be allowed to run because they are FAKE!

0,RT @realDonaldTrumpCanada was caught; red handed; putting up a fraudulent advertisement on Ronald Reagan’s Speech on Tariffs. The Reagan Foundation said that they; “created an ad campaign using selective audio and video of President Ronald Reagan. The ad misrepresents the Presidential Radio Address;” and “did not seek nor receive permission to use and edit the remarks. The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute is reviewing its legal options in this matter.” The sole purpose of this FRAUD was Canada’s hope that the United States Supreme Court will come to their “rescue” on Tariffs that they have used for years to hurt the United States. Now the United States is able to defend itself against high and overbearing Canadian Tariffs (and those from the rest of the World as well!). Ronald Reagan LOVED Tariffs for purposes of National Security and the Economy; but Canada said he didn’t! Their Advertisement was to be taken down; IMMEDIATELY; but they let it run last night during the World Series; knowing that it was a FRAUD. Because of their serious misrepresentation of the facts; and hostile act; I am increasing the Tariff on Canada by 10% over and above what they are paying now.

0,We have a very strong PEACE in the Middle East; and I believe it has a good chance of being EVERLASTING. Hamas is going to have to start returning the bodies of the deceased hostages; including two Americans; quickly; or the other Countries involved in this GREAT PEACE will take action. Some of the bodies are hard to reach; but others they can return now and; for some reason; they are not.

Let’s see what they do over the next 48 hours. I am watching this very closely.

0,THE STOCK MARKET IS STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE BECAUSE OF TARIFFS!
0,THE UNITED STATES IS WEALTHY; POWERFUL; AND NATIONALLY SECURE AGAIN; ALL BECAUSE OF TARIFFS! THE MOST IMPORTANT CASE EVER IS IN THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!
0,CANADA CHEATED AND GOT CAUGHT!!!They fraudulently took a big buy ad saying that Ronald Reagan did not like Tariffs; when actually he LOVED TARIFFS FOR OUR COUNTRY; AND ITS NATIONAL SECURITY. Canada is trying to illegally influence the United States Supreme Court in one of the most important rulings in the history of our Country. Canada has long cheated on Tariffs; charging our farmers as much as 400%. Now they; and other countries; can’t take advantage of the U.S. any longer. Thank you to the Ronald Reagan Foundation for exposing this FRAUD. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!
0,Ford and General Motors UP BIG on Tariffs placed on Big and Midsized Trucks coming from other countries. Thank you President Trump!
0,The Ronald Reagan Foundation has just announced that Canada has fraudulently used an advertisement; which is FAKE; featuring Ronald Reagan speaking negatively about Tariffs. The ad was for $75;000;000. They only did this to interfere with the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court; and other courts. TARIFFS ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO THE NATIONAL SECURITY; AND ECONOMY; OF THE U.S.A. Based on their egregious behavior; ALL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH CANADA ARE HEREBY TERMINATED. Thank you for your attention to this matter! President DJT

0,The Federal Government was preparing to “surge” San Francisco; California; on Saturday; but friends of mine who live in the area called last night to ask me not to go forward with the surge in that the Mayor; Daniel Lurie; was making substantial progress. I spoke to Mayor Lurie last night and he asked; very nicely; that I give him a chance to see if he can turn it around. I told him I think he is making a mistake; because we can do it much faster; and remove the criminals that the Law does not permit him to remove. I told him; “It’s an easier process if we do it; faster; stronger; and safer but; let’s see how you do?” The people of San Francisco have come together on fighting Crime; especially since we began to take charge of that very nasty subject. Great people like Jensen Huang; Marc Benioff; and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great. They want to give it a “shot.” Therefore; we will not surge San Francisco on Saturday. Stay tuned!

0,Senator Josh Hawley dismantles CNN’s narrative about President Trump’s White House renovation during a live interview.When reporter Manu Raju asked: “What about just uprooting the—you know—this is an iconic building?”Hawley exposed their faux outrage instantly:“Manu; I will just say this. I made this point yesterday; that I hear all of a sudden from my liberal friends that they’re very concerned about our history.”“Really?”“These are the same people who tore down every statue they could get their hands on in the last four years.”“Christopher Columbus; Thomas Jefferson; Theodore Roosevelt.”“They didn’t have any concern for history then. Now all of a sudden; they’re like; oh; the facade of the East Wing is iconic.”“Oh give me a break!”“I mean; give me a break.” Via Overton

0,Ask former President Barack Hussein Obama whether or not he really believes that in 2020 Joe Biden got 15 Million more Votes than he did in 2012 (65.9 vs. 81 Million). Additionally; ask him why it is that Joe Biden “beat” Obama in every single Swing State with the Black Vote in 2020; even though Black Voters hate him; but in no other State? THE 2020 ELECTION WAS AN ILLEGAL SCAM/HOAX THAT THE PEOPLE OF OUR GREAT COUNTRY WILL NEVER FORGET!

0,Mary Barra of General Motors; and Bill Ford of Ford Motor Company; just called to thank me for putting Tariffs on Mid Size and Large Size Trucks. Their Stock has gone through the roof! They told me that; without Tariffs; it would be a very hard; long “slog” for Truck and Car Manufacturers in the United States. I told them; it’s very simple; this is a National Security matter. With the Tariffs; we have a strong and powerful Economy and Country. Without them; we have the exact opposite!
0,In addition to everything else; Tariffs on other Countries SAVED our Cattle Ranchers!
0,The Cattle Ranchers; who I love; don’t understand that the only reason they are doing so well; for the first time in decades; is because I put Tariffs on cattle coming into the United States; including a 50% Tariff on Brazil. If it weren’t for me; they would be doing just as they’ve done for the past 20 years — Terrible! It would be nice if they would understand that; but they also have to get their prices down; because the consumer is a very big factor in my thinking; also!

0,Numerous of our NOW GREAT ALLIES in the Middle East; and areas surrounding the Middle East; have explicitly and strongly; with great enthusiasm; informed me that they would welcome the opportunity; at my request; to go into GAZA with a heavy force and “straighten our Hamas” if Hamas continues to act badly; in violation of their agreement with us. The love and spirit for the Middle East has not been seen like this in a thousand years! It is a beautiful thing to behold! I told these countries; and Israel; “NOT YET!” There is still hope that Hamas will do what is right. If they do not; an end to Hamas will be FAST; FURIOUS; &amp; BRUTAL! I would like to thank all of those countries that called to help. Also; I would like to thank the great and powerful country of Indonesia; and its wonderful leader; for all of the help they have shown and given to the Middle East; and to the U.S.A.

Since January 20th; more than 28;000 Violent Criminals have been arrested (RECORD BREAKING!); with over 6;000 illegal weapons seized; more than 1;700 child predators and 300 human traffickers taken off the streets; 5;000 innocent children rescued; 2;000 Criminal Enterprises disrupted; 1;900 kilos of Fentanyl (Enough to kill 125 Million people!) taken out — HISTORIC RESULTS. We are bringing LAW AND ORDER back to America. Kash; Dan; Andrew; and the men and women of the FBI; are doing a tremendous job; MAKING AMERICA SAFE AGAIN!
0,JACK CIATTARELLI IS A WINNER FOR NEW JERSEY! Mikie Sherrill is the exact opposite; a stone cold loser; who will drive your Energy costs through the roof; just like the Democrats are doing all over the Country but; even more so; because she has no understanding of what she is doing. Put simply; Jack Ciattarelli will bring your Energy costs down to a new low; and Mikie Sherrill will do the exact opposite — Energy costs under her will go up by levels never seen before. Mikie has no clue as to what she is doing. NEW JERSEY; VOTE FOR JACK CIATTARELLI — HE WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN!
0,Jack Ciattarelli; the wonderful New Jersey Gubernatorial Candidate that is doing very well in the Polls against a very Fake and Corrupt Mikie Sherrill; will bring Energy prices down in New Jersey by record amounts. He calls me constantly; wanting assurances that I will use the Power of Common Sense on helping New Jersey with their Energy bills; which are going up by record amounts. Jack is a man who will bring costs and prices down; rapidly; but in particular; Energy costs; because he knows that everything else will follow. Mikie Sherrill; on the contrary; has Energy policies and concepts that will double and triple prices in New Jersey. Unlike Jack; there have been no calls to Washington saying; “What do we do with these rapidly rising Electric and other costs?” I have brought Energy way down; with Gasoline soon to hit $2; with everything else following! If Mikie; who was essentially thrown out of her school for cheating; and wasn’t even allowed to walk through the Graduating Class; is ever involved with Government; Energy prices will soar at a record level! Unlike Jack Ciattarelli; nobody from her group is calling the White House in order to take advantage of the record drops in overall Energy costs. Jack Ciattarelli is a good man; who understands business; and who will bring down Energy; and other costs; by 50%; and even more. The unusually named Mikie; perhaps her only asset; will drive Energy costs up; like no Governor in History. She will be a DISASTER for New Jersey — VOTE JACK CIATTARELLI — HE WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN!
0,I am pleased to announce that ground has been broken on the White House grounds to build the new; big; beautiful White House Ballroom. Completely separate from the White House itself; the East Wing is being fully modernized as part of this process; and will be more beautiful than ever when it is complete! For more than 150 years; every President has dreamt about having a Ballroom at the White House to accommodate people for grand parties; State Visits; etc. I am honored to be the first President to finally get this much-needed project underway — with zero cost to the American Taxpayer! The White House Ballroom is being privately funded by many generous Patriots; Great American Companies; and; yours truly. This Ballroom will be happily used for Generations to come! President DJT

0,President Gustavo Petro; of Colombia; is an illegal drug leader strongly encouraging the massive production of drugs; in big and small fields; all over Colombia. It has become the biggest business in Colombia; by far; and Petro does nothing to stop it; despite large scale payments and subsidies from the USA that are nothing more than a long term rip off of America. AS OF TODAY; THESE PAYMENTS; OR ANY OTHER FORM OF PAYMENT; OR SUBSIDIES; WILL NO LONGER BE MADE TO COLOMBIA. The purpose of this drug production is the sale of massive amounts of product into the United States; causing death; destruction; and havoc. Petro; a low rated and very unpopular leader; with a fresh mouth toward America; better close up these killing fields immediately; or the United States will close them up for him; and it won’t be done nicely. Thank you for your attention to this matter! President Donald J. Trump

0,It was my great honor to destroy a very large DRUG-CARRYING SUBMARINE that was navigating towards the United States on a well known narcotrafficking transit route. U.S. Intelligence confirmed this vessel was loaded up with mostly Fentanyl; and other illegal narcotics. There were four known narcoterrorists on board the vessel. Two of the terrorists were killed. At least 25;000 Americans would die if I allowed this submarine to come ashore. The two surviving terrorists are being returned to their Countries of origin; Ecuador and Colombia; for detention and prosecution. No U.S. Forces were harmed in this strike. Under my watch; the United States of America will not tolerate narcoterrorists trafficking illegal drugs; by land or by sea. Thank you for your attention to this matter!DONALD J. TRUMPPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
0,RT @realDonaldTrumpA “Blue Slip” means that if you’re a Republican President; and there happens to be just one Democrat Senator in a state where you are appointing a U.S. Attorney or District Court Judge; you will never be successful in getting a Republican confirmed. In other words; “Blue Slips” are a disaster; and I have eight GREAT Republican U.S. Attorney Candidates who will not be able to fulfill their service to the people of a state that voted overwhelmingly for me. The only one I can appoint is a Democrat; and that’s not the deal. Nobody can say that is fair or; even; Constitutional. Thank you for your attention to this matter! President DJT.
0,RT @realDonaldTrumpThe meeting with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine was very interesting; and cordial; but I told him; as I likewise strongly suggested to President Putin; that it is time to stop the killing; and make a DEAL! Enough blood has been shed; with property lines being defined by War and Guts. They should stop where they are. Let both claim Victory; let History decide! No more shooting; no more Death; no more vast and unsustainable sums of money spent. This is a War that would have never started if I were President. Thousands of people being slaughtered each and every week — NO MORE; GO HOME TO YOUR FAMILIES IN PEACE!
0,Third Rate Congressman Thomas Massie; a Weak and Pathetic RINO from the Great Commonwealth of Kentucky; a place I love; and won big SIX TIMES; must be thrown out of office; ASAP! The incredible people of Kentucky’s 4th Congressional District gave us a mandate to; MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN; and the person that will help us do that is Navy SEAL; Army Ranger; and Fifth Generation Kentucky Farmer; Captain Ed Gallrein; a true America First Patriot. A Brave Combat Veteran; Ed knows the Wisdom and Courage required to Defend our Country; Support our Military/Veterans; and Ensure PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH. Additionally; as a very successful Businessman; Ed knows how to Create GREAT Jobs; Cut Taxes and Regulations; Promote MADE IN THE U.S.A.; Support our Amazing Farmers and American Agriculture; Unleash American Energy Dominance; and Champion our Nation’s Golden Age. In Congress; he will fight tirelessly to Keep our now very Secure Border; SECURE; Stop Migrant Crime; and Defend our always under siege Second Amendment. I hope Ed gets into the Race against Massie; who is now polling at about 9% because the Great People of Kentucky are wise to him — He only votes against the Republican Party; making life very easy for the Radical Left. Unlike “lightweight” Massie; a totally ineffective LOSER who has failed us so badly; CAPTAIN ED GALLREIN IS A WINNER WHO WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN. Should he decide to challenge Massie; Captain Ed Gallrein has my Complete and Total Endorsement. RUN; ED; RUN — MAGA!
0,George Santos was somewhat of a “rogue;” but there are many rogues throughout our Country that aren’t forced to serve seven years in prison. I started to think about George when the subject of Democrat Senator Richard “Da Nang Dick” Blumenthal came up again. As everyone remembers; “Da Nang” stated for almost twenty years that he was a proud Vietnam Veteran; having endured the worst of the War; watching the Wounded and Dead as he raced up the hills and down the valleys; blood streaming from his face. He was “a Great Hero;” he would leak to any and all who would listen — And then it happened! He was a COMPLETE AND TOTAL FRAUD. He never went to Vietnam; he never saw Vietnam; he never experienced the Battles there; or anywhere else. His War Hero status; and even minimal service in our Military; was totally and completely MADE UP. This is far worse than what George Santos did; and at least Santos had the Courage; Conviction; and Intelligence to ALWAYS VOTE REPUBLICAN! George has been in solitary confinement for long stretches of time and; by all accounts; has been horribly mistreated. Therefore; I just signed a Commutation; releasing George Santos from prison; IMMEDIATELY. Good luck George; have a great life!
0,Thank you to North Carolina’s incredible Republican State Legislators; who just introduced a new; fair; and improved; Congressional Map; a situation I am watching; and strongly supporting; very closely. It was my Great Honor to win North Carolina six times; including Primaries; in 2016; 2020; and 2024; and this new Map would give the fantastic people of North Carolina the opportunity to elect an additional MAGA Republican in the 2026 Midterm Elections; which would be A HUGE VICTORY for our America First Agenda; not just in North Carolina; but across our Nation. Remember; I won the Electoral College; 312-226; Counties Nationwide; 2;700 to 525; all seven Swing States (A LANDSLIDE!); and now I have the best Polling Numbers I've ever had. Our Party has never been more UNITED; and we are getting so much done for the American People because of it. Therefore; I encourage all of my Republican friends in the North Carolina Legislature to work as hard as they can to pass this new Map so that we can continue our incredible Record of SUCCESS. It is wonderful to see Republicans in “The Tar Heel State” standing up to Save our Country and; MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. THANK YOU NORTH CAROLINA — MAGA2026!

0,The United States Air Force Academy Cadet Chapel has been a CONSTRUCTION DISASTER from the time it was built in 1962. The earlier stories are that it leaked on Day One; and that was the good part. Hundreds of Millions of Dollars have been spent. The renovation; which essentially has been going on since the day it was built; is now projected to go on until 2028; costing an additional $90 Million Dollars; bringing the grand total to $335 Million Dollars. This mess should be investigated. Very unfair to the Cadets — A COMPLETE ARCHITECTURAL CATASTROPHE!
0,I have eight GREAT U.S. Attorneys; Highly Respected ALL; who will not be confirmed for their positions in various Highly Consequential States only because they’re Republicans; and the Democrats have convinced Chuck Grassley to honor the stupid and outdated “Blue Slip” tradition; which precludes very talented and dedicated people from attaining High Office. The Democrats violate this practice in order to get people in; but Republicans just don’t. These GREAT people’s careers have been badly hurt by the Radical Left Democrats; using an old and ridiculous custom strictly to their advantage. What a shame!
0,I am outraged that the International Maritime Organization is voting in London this week to pass a global Carbon Tax. The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping; and will not adhere to it in any way; shape; or form.

Stand with the United States; and vote NO in London tomorrow!

0,I have just concluded my telephone conversation with President Vladimir Putin; of Russia; and it was a very productive one. President Putin congratulated me and the United States on the Great Accomplishment of Peace in the Middle East; something that; he said; has been dreamed of for centuries. I actually believe that the Success in the Middle East will help in our negotiation in attaining an end to the War with Russia/Ukraine. President Putin thanked the First Lady; Melania; for her involvement with children. He was very appreciative; and said that this will continue. We also spent a great deal of time talking about Trade between Russia and the United States when the War with Ukraine is over. At the conclusion of the call; we agreed that there will be a meeting of our High Level Advisors; next week. The United States’ initial meetings will be led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio; together with various other people; to be designated. A meeting location is to be determined. President Putin and I will then meet in an agreed upon location; Budapest; Hungary; to see if we can bring this “inglorious” War; between Russia and Ukraine; to an end. President Zelenskyy and I will be meeting tomorrow; in the Oval Office; where we will discuss my conversation with President Putin; and much more.

0,Throughout most of our History; America’s Colleges and Universities have been a Great Strategic Asset of the United States. Tragically; however; much of Higher Education has lost its way; and is now corrupting our Youth and Society with WOKE; SOCIALIST; and ANTI-AMERICAN Ideology that serves as justification for discriminatory practices by Universities that are Unconstitutional and Unlawful. My Administration is fixing this; and FAST; with our Great Reform Agenda in Higher Education. Our Nation’s Great Institutions will once again prioritize Merit and Hard Work before “group identity;” resulting in tremendous new Research and Opportunity to benefit all Americans; and Equality being honored in American Businesses; Courts; and Culture.To those Universities that continue to illegally discriminate based on Race or Sex; we will continue our current efforts to swiftly and forcefully enforce Federal Law. But for those Institutions that want to quickly return to the pursuit of Truth and Achievement; they are invited to enter into a forward looking Agreement with the Federal Government to help bring about the Golden Age of Academic Excellence in Higher Education. They will agree to follow Federal Law; and protect the Civil Rights of ALL Students; Faculty; and Employees on Campuses. They will stop racist Admission Policies; and put an end to unjust and illegal discrimination in Faculty Hiring. These Institutions will commit to High Quality Standards; an Intellectually Open Campus Environment (including the protection of Free Speech and Debate); Institutional Neutrality; major steps toward Affordability for Students; and an end to the entanglement of Foreign Money in the Finances of American Universities. Americans deserve to be treated in accordance with their demonstrated achievements and potential; and upon regaining this fundamentally American Value; our Nation will be unstoppable. We will once again have Universities that develop the talents of our amazing young people to lead lives of Success and Fulfillment; cultivate a Love of Country and a Culture of Achievement; and help make all Americans proud; safe; prosperous; and free!

We have identified funds to do this; and Secretary Hegseth will use them to PAY OUR TROOPS. I will not allow the Democrats to hold our Military; and the entire Security of our Nation; HOSTAGE; with their dangerous Government Shutdown. The Radical Left Democrats should OPEN THE GOVERNMENT; and then we can work together to address Healthcare; and many other things that they want to destroy.

0,It has just been learned that China has taken an extraordinarily aggressive position on Trade in sending an extremely hostile letter to the World; stating that they were going to; effective November 1st; 2025; impose large scale Export Controls on virtually every product they make; and some not even made by them. This affects ALL Countries; without exception; and was obviously a plan devised by them years ago. It is absolutely unheard of in International Trade; and a moral disgrace in dealing with other Nations.Based on the fact that China has taken this unprecedented position; and speaking only for the U.S.A.; and not other Nations who were similarly threatened; starting November 1st; 2025 (or sooner; depending on any further actions or changes taken by China); the United States of America will impose a Tariff of 100% on China; over and above any Tariff that they are currently paying. Also on November 1st; we will impose Export Controls on any and all critical software.It is impossible to believe that China would have taken such an action; but they have; and the rest is History. Thank you for your attention to this matter!DONALD J. TRUMPPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
0,Thank you to President Putin!
0,Some very strange things are happening in China! They are becoming very hostile; and sending letters to Countries throughout the World; that they want to impose Export Controls on each and every element of production having to do with Rare Earths; and virtually anything else they can think of; even if it’s not manufactured in China. Nobody has ever seen anything like this but; essentially; it would “clog” the Markets; and make life difficult for virtually every Country in the World; especially for China. We have been contacted by other Countries who are extremely angry at this great Trade hostility; which came out of nowhere. Our relationship with China over the past six months has been a very good one; thereby making this move on Trade an even more surprising one. I have always felt that they’ve been lying in wait; and now; as usual; I have been proven right! There is no way that China should be allowed to hold the World “captive;” but that seems to have been their plan for quite some time; starting with the “Magnets” and; other Elements that they have quietly amassed into somewhat of a Monopoly position; a rather sinister and hostile move; to say the least. But the U.S. has Monopoly positions also; much stronger and more far reaching than China’s. I have just not chosen to use them; there was never a reason for me to do so — UNTIL NOW! The letter they sent is many pages long; and details; with great specificity; each and every Element that they want to withhold from other Nations. Things that were routine are no longer routine at all. I have not spoken to President Xi because there was no reason to do so. This was a real surprise; not only to me; but to all the Leaders of the Free World. I was to meet President Xi in two weeks; at APEC; in South Korea; but now there seems to be no reason to do so. The Chinese letters were especially inappropriate in that this was the Day that; after three thousand years of bedlam and fighting; there is PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST. I wonder if that timing was coincidental? Dependent on what China says about the hostile “order” that they have just put out; I will be forced; as President of the United States of America; to financially counter their move. For every Element that they have been able to monopolize; we have two. I never thought it would come to this but perhaps; as with all things; the time has come. Ultimately; though potentially painful; it will be a very good thing; in the end; for the U.S.A. One of the Policies that we are calculating at this moment is a massive increase of Tariffs on Chinese products coming into the United States of America. There are many other countermeasures that are; likewise; under serious consideration. Thank you for your attention to this matter! DONALD J. TRUMP; PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

He would talk about his life in the military in almost every speech; in particular the death defying dangers he faced in his many years “fight for freedom” while in Vietnam. He stated that “the battles were violent and long; but there was no going back” - And then it happened; Blumenthal was found out to be a FRAUD. The soldiers in his so-called “platoon” came forward and said that they had no idea who this guy was. He was revealed; broke down and admitted; tears flowing from his eyes; that he LIED; a Whopper; one that lasted 20 year. This guy shouldn’t even be in the U.S. Senate. It should be investigated; and Justice should be sought. Right now there is a Congressman sitting in prison for lying about his past during a campaign. Well; those lies were nothing compared to those of Richard “Da Nang Dick” Blumenthal; perhaps the greatest phony in the history of the United States Senate. He should be allowed to speak no longer!

0,I knew Al Sharpton for many years; not that it matters; but he was a major “TRUMP” fan. He’d ask me to go to his fake Rallies all the time; because I brought BIG Crowds; and he couldn’t get anybody to come without me. Then he did the Tawana Brawley Hoax; one of the worst Low Level Scams in History; and that set him back; BIG TIME! Then he got to know Brian Roberts; Chairman of Fake News NBC; who gave him what would become one of the Lowest Rated Shows in Television History. Roberts is afraid to take him off because it wouldn’t be “Politically Correct.” This is just one of the many reasons that the Federal Communications Commission should look into the license of NBC; which shows almost exclusively positive Democrat content. Likewise; ABC Fake News — About the same thing; 97% negative to Republicans!
0,Before I became President; “OPEC” kept Oil prices high. It wasn’t right for them to do that but; in a different form; is being done again — This time by the Big Homebuilders of our Nation. They’re my friends; and they’re very important to the SUCCESS of our Country; but now; they can get Financing; and they have to start building Homes. They’re sitting on 2 Million empty lots; A RECORD. I’m asking Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to get Big Homebuilders going and; by so doing; help restore the American Dream!

0,There have been very positive discussions with Hamas; and Countries from all over the World (Arab; Muslim; and everyone else) this weekend; to release the Hostages; end the War in Gaza but; more importantly; finally have long sought PEACE in the Middle East. These talks have been very successful; and proceeding rapidly. The technical teams will again meet Monday; in Egypt; to work through and clarify the final details. I am told that the first phase should be completed this week; and I am asking everyone to MOVE FAST. I will continue to monitor this Centuries old “conflict.” TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE OR; MASSIVE BLOODSHED WILL FOLLOW — SOMETHING THAT NOBODY WANTS TO SEE!
0,Why is FoxNews and Peter Doocy putting on Democrat Senator Mark Kelly to talk about; totally unabated or challenged; Healthcare? The FAKE SPIN is so bad for Republicans that it is hard to believe that we WIN. It will be very unfair; in the future; when they don’t have “TRUMP” to fight for them. Therefore; we should fix it; NOW! I’m watching this Interview. It just doesn’t end. Fox should either get on board; or get off board; NOW; but at this point; it just doesn’t make any difference to me. They suck up the Ratings because of us; and then spin them in the Democrats’ direction. They refuse to put up Polls that correctly show me at 65% in Popularity; a Republican RECORD; but if I have a fake bad “Poll;” many of which are done by Fox (One of the worst “Pollsters” out there is the FoxNews Poll); they put them up immediately; and with gusto. Republicans are so tired of this fight with Fox always trying to be so “politically correct!” Thank you for your attention to this matter.
0,It has just come out that the Radical Left Lunatic; Jay Jones; who is running against Jason Miyares; the GREAT Attorney General in Virginia; made SICK and DEMENTED jokes; if they were jokes at all; which were not funny; and that he wrote down and sent around to people; concerning the murdering of a Republican Legislator; his wife; and their children. Abigail Spanberger; who is running for Governor; is weak and ineffective; and refuses to acknowledge what this Lunatic has done. Even Democrats are saying it is “RESIGNATION FROM CAMPAIGN” TERRITORY. Democrat Jay Jones should drop out of the Race; IMMEDIATELY; and the People of Virginia must continue to have a GREAT Attorney General in Jason Miyares who; by the way; has my Complete and Total Endorsement — JASON WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN!

It has been taken out of their package; which is VERY BAD for Republicans in the upcoming Midterms.

0,After negotiations; Israel has agreed to the initial withdrawal line; which we have shown to; and shared with; Hamas. When Hamas confirms; the Ceasefire will be IMMEDIATELY effective; the Hostages and Prisoner Exchange will begin; and we will create the conditions for the next phase of withdrawal; which will bring us close to the end of this 3;000 YEAR CATASTROPHE. Thank you for your attention to this matter and; STAY TUNED!
0,Corrupt Letitia James is costing New York State Hundreds of Billions of Dollars in lost business. No company or individual wants to be there; knowing that she’s the “Attorney General.” She is a Complete and Total Disaster; who tried running against Kathy Hochul for Governor; and only got 1% of the Vote in Polls; and QUIT. She then went back to her WITCH HUNT against President Donald J. Trump; and others. Until this “SCUM” is removed from the Attorney General’s Office; no company will move to New York; and few companies will be using the New York Stock Exchange; or NASDAQ; for going Public. The new Texas Exchange will be taking ALL of this business away; and we’re talking Hundreds of Billions of Dollars!
0,I appreciate that Israel has temporarily stopped the bombing in order to give the Hostage release and Peace Deal a chance to be completed. Hamas must move quickly; or else all bets will be off. I will not tolerate delay; which many think will happen; or any outcome where Gaza poses a threat again. Let’s get this done; FAST. Everyone will be treated fairly!
0,To ICE; Border Patrol; Law Enforcement; and all U.S. Military: As per my August 25; 2025 Executive Order; please be advised that; from this point forward; anybody burning the American Flag will be subject to one year in prison.

0,I am proud to announce that on Sunday; October 5th; I will be hosting a Salute to the Fleet in Norfolk; Virginia; to honor our brave men and women of the United States Navy. Our wonderful First Lady; as well as our great Secretary of War; Pete Hegseth; and Secretary of the Navy; John Phelan; will be joining me as we mark 250 years of MARITIME DOMINANCE in the United States of America! Chuck Schumer; Hakeem Jeffries; and the other Minority Radical Left Democrats tried their best; through the ridiculous Government Shutdown; to destroy this wonderful celebration of the U.S. Navy’s Birthday; and to stop our Military Servicemembers from celebrating American Naval History. However; I believe; “THE SHOW MUST GO ON!” The U.S. Navy has been planning this event for many months and; despite the Democrats’ incompetence; I refuse to let them down as their Commander-in-Chief. This will be the largest Celebration in the History of the Navy. Thousands of our brave Active Duty Servicemembers and Military Families will be in attendance; and I look forward to this special day with all of them. See you on Sunday!
0,Based on the Statement just issued by Hamas; I believe they are ready for a lasting PEACE. Israel must immediately stop the bombing of Gaza; so that we can get the Hostages out safely and quickly! Right now; it’s far too dangerous to do that. We are already in discussions on details to be worked out. This is not about Gaza alone; this is about long sought PEACE in the Middle East.
0,It is my Great Honor to endorse America First Patriot Matt Van Epps; who is running to represent the Great People of Tennessee’s 7th Congressional District. A West Point Graduate; and Combat Decorated Army Helicopter Pilot; Matt knows the WISDOM and COURAGE required to Defend our Country; Support our Incredible Military/Veterans; and Ensure PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH.

0,Congratulations to Idaho on breaking ground for your new Veterans Home today. Glad to have worked with your GREAT Senator Jim Risch to have made this happen. Veterans are a priority for us!
0,Hamas has been a ruthless and violent threat; for many years; in the Middle East! They have killed (and made lives unbearably miserable); culminating with the October 7th MASSACRE; in Israel; babies; woman; children; old people; and many young men and women; boys and girls; getting ready to celebrate their future lives together. As retribution for the October 7th attack on civilization; more than 25;000 Hamas “soldiers” have already been killed. Most of the rest are surrounded and MILITARILY TRAPPED; just waiting for me to give the word; “GO;” for their lives to be quickly extinguished. As for the rest; we know where and who you are; and you will be hunted down; and killed. I am asking that all innocent Palestinians immediately leave this area of potentially great future death for safer parts of Gaza. Everyone will be well cared for by those that are waiting to help. Fortunately for Hamas; however; they will be given one last chance! Great; powerful; and very rich Nations of the Middle East; and the surrounding areas beyond; together with the United States of America; have agreed; with Israel signing on; to PEACE; after 3000 years; in the Middle East. THIS DEAL ALSO SPARES THE LIVES OF ALL REMAINING HAMAS FIGHTERS! The details of the document are known to the WORLD; and it is a great one for ALL! We will have PEACE in the Middle East one way or the other. The violence and bloodshed will stop. RELEASES THE HOSTAGES; ALL OF THEM; INCLUDING THE BODIES OF THOSE THAT ARE DEAD; NOW! An Agreement must be reached with Hamas by Sunday Evening at SIX (6) P.M.; Washington; D.C. time. Every Country has signed on! If this LAST CHANCE agreement is not reached; all HELL; like no one has ever seen before; will break out against Hamas. THERE WILL BE PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. Thank you for your attention to this matter! PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP

0,As I determined on September 27th; when I activated and called into service the National Guard in Oregon; conditions continue to deteriorate into lawless mayhem. Our GREAT Federal Law Enforcement Officers have not been able to enforce the Laws in Oregon. ANTIFA and the Radical Left Anarchists have been viciously attacking our Federal Law Enforcement Officers; men and women who are simply doing their job; protecting Federal Property; and enforcing Federal Immigration Laws and the Rule of Law. We will never allow MOBS to take over our streets; burn our Cities; or destroy America.

Russell was sharp and engaged in service up until the end. Our hearts and prayers are with his incredible wife; Wendy; his 10 children; 57 grandchildren; and more than 167 great-grandchildren; as well as Members of the Church all over our Country. Russell had a remarkable life; pioneering life-saving heart surgery techniques and; of course; his ministry of many decades. He was a physician; literally and spiritually; and will be greatly missed!
0,I have been briefed on the horrendous shooting that took place at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; in Grand Blanc; Michigan. The FBI was immediately on scene; and will be leading the Federal Investigation; and providing full support to State and Local Officials. The suspect is dead; but there is still a lot to learn. This appears to be yet another targeted attack on Christians in the United States of America. The Trump Administration will keep the Public posted; as we always do. In the meantime; PRAY for the victims; and their families. THIS EPIDEMIC OF VIOLENCE IN OUR COUNTRY MUST END; IMMEDIATELY!

This is different from what Director Christopher Wray stated; over and over again! That’s right; as it now turns out; FBI Agents were at; and in; the January 6th Protest; probably acting as Agitators and Insurrectionists; but certainly not as “Law Enforcement Officials.” I want to know who each and every one of these so-called “Agents” are; and what they were up to on that now “Historic” Day. Many Great American Patriots were made to pay a very big price only for the love of their Country. I owe this investigation of “Dirty Cops and Crooked Politicians” to them! Christopher Wray; the then Director of the FBI; has some major explaining to do. That’s two in a row; Comey and Wray; who got caught LYING; with our Great Country at stake. WE CAN NEVER LET THIS HAPPEN TO AMERICA AGAIN!

Intense negotiations have been going on for four days; and will continue for as long as necessary in order to get a Successfully Completed Agreement. All of the Countries within the Region are involved; Hamas is very much aware of these discussions; and Israel has been informed at all levels; including Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu. There is more Goodwill and Enthusiasm for getting a Deal done; after so many decades; than I have ever seen before. Everyone is excited to put this period of Death and Darkness behind them. It is an Honor to be a part of this Negotiation. We must get the Hostages back; and get a PERMANENT AND LONGLASTING PEACE!

0,Corrupt and Totally Trump Deranged Lisa Monaco (A purported pawn of Legal Lightweight Andrew Weissmann); was a senior National Security aide under Barack Hussein Obama; and a Lawfare and Weaponization obsessed Deputy Attorney General under Crooked Joe Biden and Lisa’s Puppet “Boss” Attorney General Merrick Garland; who were all the architects of the worst ever Deep State Conspiracies against our Country (RUSSIA; RUSSIA; RUSSIA; the January 6th Hoax; the Illegal Raid on Mar-a-Lago; the Biden “Autopen” Scandal; the Documents Witch Hunt; and more!). Monaco has been shockingly hired as the President of Global Affairs for Microsoft; in a very senior role with access to Highly Sensitive Information. Monaco’s having that kind of access is unacceptable; and cannot be allowed to stand. She is a menace to U.S. National Security; especially given the major contracts that Microsoft has with the United States Government. Because of Monaco’s many wrongful acts; the U.S. Government recently stripped her of all Security Clearances; took away all of her access to National Security Intelligence; and banned her from all Federal Properties. It is my opinion that Microsoft should immediately terminate the employment of Lisa Monaco. Thank you for your attention to this matter! President DJT
0,I have been asked by many people about the life and times of Amelia Earhart; such an interesting story; and would I consider declassifying and releasing everything about her; in particular; her last; fatal flight! She was an Aviation Pioneer; the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean; and achieved many other Aviation “firsts.” She disappeared in the South Pacific while trying to become the first woman to fly around the World. Amelia made it almost three quarters around the World before she suddenly; and without notice; vanished; never to be seen again. Her disappearance; almost 90 years ago; has captivated millions. I am ordering my Administration to declassify and release all Government Records related to Amelia Earhart; her final trip; and everything else about her.

0,Whether you like Corrupt James Comey or not; and I can’t imagine too many people liking him; HE LIED! It is not a complex lie; it’s a very simple; but IMPORTANT one. There is no way he can explain his way out of it. He is a Dirty Cop; and always has been; but he was just assigned a Crooked Joe Biden appointed Judge; so he’s off to a very good start. Nevertheless; words are words; and he wasn’t hedging or in dispute. He was very positive; there was no doubt in his mind about what he said; or meant by saying it. He left himself ZERO margin of error on a big and important answer to a question. He just got unexpectedly caught. James “Dirty Cop” Comey was a destroyer of lives. He knew exactly what he was saying; and that it was a very serious and far reaching lie for which a very big price must be paid! President DJT

0,Starting October 1st; 2025; we will be imposing a 100% Tariff on any branded or patented Pharmaceutical Product; unless a Company IS BUILDING their Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Plant in America. “IS BUILDING” will be defined as; “breaking ground” and/or “under construction.” There will; therefore; be no Tariff on these Pharmaceutical Products if construction has started.

It is a very unfair practice; but we must protect; for National Security and other reasons; our Manufacturing process. Thank you for your attention to this matter!
0,In order to protect our Great Heavy Truck Manufacturers from unfair outside competition; I will be imposing; as of October 1st; 2025; a 25% Tariff on all “Heavy (Big!)

We need our Truckers to be financially healthy and strong; for many reasons; but above all else; for National Security purposes!

He will be a GREAT Governor; and Sherrill wants Open Borders (again!); men playing in Women’s Sports; Transgender for everyone; and all of the things that almost DESTROYED America. She is a big supporter of the perhaps future Communist Mayor of New York City! We need Jack in New Jersey!!! President DJT
0,A REAL DISGRACE took place at the United Nations yesterday — Not one; not two; but three very sinister events! First; the escalator going up to the Main Speaking Floor came to a screeching halt. It stopped on a dime. It’s amazing that Melania and I didn’t fall forward onto the sharp edges of these steel steps; face first. It was only that we were each holding the handrail tightly or; it would have been a disaster. This was absolutely sabotage; as noted by a day’s earlier “post” in The London Times that said UN workers “joked about turning off an escalator.” The people that did it should be arrested! Then; as I stood before a Television crowd of millions of people all over the World; and important Leaders in the Hall; my teleprompter didn’t work. It was stone cold dark. I immediately thought to myself; “Wow; first the escalator event; and now a bad teleprompter. What kind of a place is this?” I then proceeded to make a Speech without a teleprompter; which kicked in about 15 minutes later. The good news is the Speech has gotten fantastic reviews. Maybe they appreciated the fact that very few people could have done what I did. And third; after making the Speech; I was told that the sound was completely off in the Auditorium where the Speech was made; that World Leaders; unless they used the interpreters’ earpieces; couldn’t hear a thing. The first person I saw at the conclusion of the Speech was Melania; who was sitting right up front. I said; “How did I do?” And she said; “I couldn’t hear a word you said.” This wasn’t a coincidence; this was triple sabotage at the UN. They ought to be ashamed of themselves. I’m sending a copy of this letter to the Secretary General; and I demand an immediate investigation. No wonder the United Nations hasn’t been able to do the job that they were put in existence to do. All security tapes at the escalator should be saved; especially the emergency stop button. The Secret Service is involved. Thank you for your attention to this matter!
0,Kamala Harris; who is DUMB AS A ROCK; is going around and using; as a standard part of her Speech on why she lost the Election; that 2024 was the “closest Presidential Election in the 21st Century.” Everyone knows this is a lie; and was covered as such by Fox News! I won the Electoral College; 312-226; a LANDSLIDE; Counties Nationwide; 2;600 to 525; a LANDSLIDE; all seven Swing States; a LANDSLIDE; and; despite the fact that California’s Fake Mail In Ballots came in at ridiculous numbers (It was RIGGED!); I still won the Popular Vote by MILLIONS! Bush; as an example; won the Election by 537 Votes; and many other Elections were very close. Kamala’s “closest in the 21st Century” soundbite was; like everything else in the Democrat Party; A TOTAL LIE! I expect an apology. Thank you for your attention to this matter!
0,I have been briefed on the deadly shooting at the ICE Field Office in Dallas; Texas. It has now been revealed the deranged shooter wrote “Anti-ICE” on his shell casings. This is despicable! The Brave Men and Women of ICE are just trying to do their jobs; and remove the “WORST of the WORST” Criminals out of our Country; but they are facing an unprecedented increase in threats; violence; and attacks by Deranged Radical Leftists. This violence is the result of the Radical Left Democrats constantly demonizing Law Enforcement; calling for ICE to be demolished; and comparing ICE Officers to “Nazis.” The continuing violence from Radical Left Terrorists; in the aftermath of Charlie Kirk’s assassination; must be stopped. ICE Officers; and other Brave Members of Law Enforcement; are under grave threat. We have already declared ANTIFA a Terrorist Organization; and I will be signing an Executive Order this week to dismantle these Domestic Terrorism Networks. I AM CALLING ON ALL DEMOCRATS TO STOP THIS RHETORIC AGAINST ICE AND AMERICA’S LAW ENFORCEMENT; RIGHT NOW! The Trump Administration is fully committed to backing Law Enforcement; Strong Borders; securing our Homeland; deporting Violent Illegal Criminals; and fully rooting out the Left Wing Domestic Terrorism that is terrorizing our Country. Thank you for your attention to this matter!
0,The Democrats want Illegal Aliens; many of them VIOLENT CRIMINALS; to receive FREE Healthcare. The Democrats want $500 Million Dollars to help Radical Left News Outfits. The Democrats want to leave DEAD PEOPLE on Medicaid and Social Security rolls; so that Criminals can continue to be allowed to receive that payment; and steal their money. The Democrats want to cut Billions of Dollars from our once vulnerable Rural Hospitals (which we fixed by giving them the largest Cash Infusion; EVER!). The Democrats want men playing in women’s sports; “Transgender” for EVERYBODY; Open Borders and; perhaps most importantly of all; a five letter word; CRIME (They like it; and we don’t!); and so many other things that will destroy America. We cannot let this happen!
0,After reviewing the details of the unserious and ridiculous demands being made by the Minority Radical Left Democrats in return for their Votes to keep our thriving Country open; I have decided that no meeting with their Congressional Leaders could possibly be productive. They are threatening to shut down the Government of the United States unless they can have over $1 Trillion Dollars in new spending to continue free healthcare for Illegal Aliens (A monumental cost!); force Taxpayers to fund Transgender surgery for minors; have dead people on the Medicaid roles; allow Illegal Alien Criminals to steal Billions of Dollars in American Taxpayer Benefits; try to force our Country to again open our Borders to Criminals and to the World; allow men to play in women’s sports; and essentially create Transgender operations for everybody. These Radical Left Views and Policies is what allowed me to win the Presidential Election; including all seven Swing States; and the Popular Vote; IN A HISTORIC LANDSLIDE. There are consequences to losing Elections but; based on their letter to me; the Democrats haven’t figured that out yet. They are trying to eliminate the popular $50 Billion Dollar Rural and Vulnerable Hospital Fund; which was passed with only Republican Votes; and proudly signed into Law by ME. The Democrats in Congress seem to have totally lost their way. They obviously have no idea what it means to put America First or to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! All Congressional Democrats want to do is enact Radical Left Policies that nobody voted for — High Taxes; Open Borders; No Consequences for Violent Criminals; Men in Women’s Sports; Taxpayer funded “TRANSGENDER” surgery; and much more. Few people voted for what they represent; which would lead to the destruction of America. Instead; people voted for COMMON SENSE; and that’s what the Republicans and your President; “DONALD J. TRUMP;” stand for. I look forward to meeting with them if they get serious about the future of our Nation. We must keep the Government open; and legislate like true Patriots rather than hold American Citizens hostage; knowing that they want our now thriving Country closed. I’ll be happy to meet with them if they agree to the Principles in this Letter. They must do their job! Otherwise; it will just be another long and brutal slog through their radicalized quicksand. To the Leaders of the Democrat Party; the ball is in your court. I look forward to meeting with you when you become realistic about the things that our Country stands for. DO THE RIGHT THING!DONALD J. TRUMP; PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
0,I can’t believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back. The White House was told by ABC that his Show was cancelled! Something happened between then and now because his audience is GONE; and his “talent” was never there. Why would they want someone back who does so poorly; who’s not funny; and who puts the Network in jeopardy by playing 99% positive Democrat GARBAGE. He is yet another arm of the DNC and; to the best of my knowledge; that would be a major Illegal Campaign Contribution. I think we’re going to test ABC out on this. Let’s see how we do. Last time I went after them; they gave me $16 Million Dollars. This one sounds even more lucrative. A true bunch of losers! Let Jimmy Kimmel rot in his bad Ratings.

0,After getting to know and fully understand the Ukraine/Russia Military and Economic situation and; after seeing the Economic trouble it is causing Russia; I think Ukraine; with the support of the European Union; is in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form. With time; patience; and the financial support of Europe and; in particular; NATO; the original Borders from where this War started; is very much an option. Why not? Russia has been fighting aimlessly for three and a half years a War that should have taken a Real Military Power less than a week to win. This is not distinguishing Russia. In fact; it is very much making them look like “a paper tiger.” When the people living in Moscow; and all of the Great Cities; Towns; and Districts all throughout Russia; find out what is really going on with this War; the fact that it’s almost impossible for them to get Gasoline through the long lines that are being formed; and all of the other things that are taking place in their War Economy; where most of their money is being spent on fighting Ukraine; which has Great Spirit; and only getting better; Ukraine would be able to take back their Country in its original form and; who knows; maybe even go further than that! Putin and Russia are in BIG Economic trouble; and this is the time for Ukraine to act. In any event; I wish both Countries well. We will continue to supply weapons to NATO for NATO to do what they want with them. Good luck to all! DONALD J. TRUMP; PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
0,Congratulations to Attorney General Pam Bondi; Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche; and the entire DOJ team on the conviction; in Florida; of the person who attempted an assassination on my life. The trial was meticulously handled; and I would like to thank the Judge and Jury for their time; professionalism; and patience. This was an evil man with an evil intention; and they caught him. I would also like to thank the Secret Service; Department of Florida Law Enforcement; and the wonderful person who spotted him running from the site of the crime; and acted by following him; and getting all information on car type and license plate to the Sheriff’s Office; IMMEDIATELY; which led to his arrest and conviction. What incredible instinct and foresight this person had — A very big moment for JUSTICE IN AMERICA!
0,Highly Respected President of Argentina; Javier Milei; has proven to be a truly fantastic and powerful Leader for the Great People of Argentina; advancing on all levels at record speed. He inherited a “total mess” with horrible Inflation caused by the previous Radical Left President (much like Crooked Joe Biden; the WORST President in the History our Nation); yet he has brought stability back to Argentina’s Economy; and lifted it to a new level of Prominence and Respect! We have had a tremendous relationship with Argentina; which has become a strong ally; thanks to President Milei. I look forward to continuing working closely with him so that both of our Countries can continue on their incredible paths of success. Argentina: Javier Milei is a very good friend; fighter; and WINNER; and has my Complete and Total Endorsement for Re-Election as President — He will never let you down!
0,It was a great honor to speak before the United Nations. I believe the speech was very well received. It focused very much on energy and migration/immigration. I have been talking about this for a long period of time and this Forum; was the absolute best from the standpoint of making these two important statements. I hope everybody gets to watch it! The teleprompter was broken and the escalator came to a sudden hault as we were ridding up to the podium; but both of those events probably made the speech more interesting than it would have been otherwise. It is always an honor to speak at the United Nations; even if; their equipment is somewhat faulty. Make America Great Again!
0,Earlier this month I spoke with the Highly Respected President of Uzbekistan; Shavkat Mirziyoyev. Today I want to congratulate President Mirziyoyev on signing a GREAT Deal with Boeing! Worth over $8 Billion Dollars; Uzbekistan Airways is purchasing 22;787 Dreamliners. This will create over 35;000 jobs in the United States. President Mirziyoyev is a man of his word; and we will continue to work together on many more items! Thank you for your attention to this matter.
0,I just concluded a wonderful call with the Highly Respected President of Kazakhstan; Kassym-Jomart Kemeluly Tokayev. They have signed the largest Railroad Equipment Purchase in History; $4 Billion Dollars Worth of United States Locomotives and Rail Equipment. We need to support our U.S. Rail Industry; which has been attacked by Fake Environmentalists for years. Congratulations to President Tokayev on his great purchase. This Country; and the World; was built on reliable; beautiful Railroads. Now they will be coming back; FAST!

0,It is my honor to appoint Lindsey Halligan; who has been serving as Special Assistant to the President at the White House; as United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. Lindsey is a tough; smart; and loyal attorney; who has worked with me for a long time; including in the winning fight against the Weaponization of our Justice System by Crooked Joe Biden and the Radical Left Democrats; which she witnessed firsthand when she stood up for my rights during the Unconstitutional and UnAmerican raid on my home; Mar-a-Lago; in Palm Beach; Florida. As a Partner at the biggest Law Firm in Florida; Lindsey proved herself to be a tremendous trial lawyer; and later represented me (and WON!) in the disgraceful Democrat Documents Hoax; as well as MANY other major; high profile cases. She is extremely intelligent; fearless and; working with Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche; has the strength and determination to be absolutely OUTSTANDING in this new and very important role. Congratulations; Lindsey - You will do GREAT things for JUSTICE; Virginia; and our Country! Thank you for your attention to this matter. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP
0,Pam Bondi is doing a GREAT job as Attorney General of the United States. She is very careful; very smart; loves our Country; but needs a tough prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia; like my recommendation; Lindsey Halligan; to get things moving. What we don’t need is a Democrat Endorsed “Republican.” I will be nominating Lindsey Halligan to be the United States Attorney in this very important part of our Great Country. She will be Fair; Smart; and will provide; desperately needed; JUSTICE FOR ALL!
0,Pam: I have reviewed over 30 statements and posts saying that; essentially; “same old story as last time; all talk; no action. Nothing is being done. What about Comey; Adam “Shifty” Schiff; Leticia??? They’re all guilty as hell; but nothing is going to be done.” Then we almost put in a Democrat supported U.S. Attorney; in Virginia; with a really bad Republican past. A Woke RINO; who was never going to do his job. That’s why two of the worst Dem Senators PUSHED him so hard. He even lied to the media and said he quit; and that we had no case. No; I fired him; and there is a GREAT CASE; and many lawyers; and legal pundits; say so. Lindsey Halligan is a really good lawyer; and likes you; a lot. We can’t delay any longer; it’s killing our reputation and credibility. They impeached me twice; and indicted me (5 times!); OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED; NOW!!! President DJT

The strike killed 3 male narcoterrorists aboard the vessel; which was in international waters. No U.S. Forces were harmed in this strike. STOP SELLING FENTANYL; NARCOTICS; AND ILLEGAL DRUGS IN AMERICA; AND COMMITTING VIOLENCE AND TERRORISM AGAINST AMERICANS!!!
0,We passed the Continuing Resolution in the Republican House today; which was a very good thing because it shows that Republicans want to keep the Government open but; in the Senate; we have 53 Republicans; and we need 60 Votes. I want to thank Senator John Fetterman; a Democrat; for voting for us; but the Democrats want to shut the Country down. They want to open the Borders; they want us to stop fighting Crime (and; by the way; D.C. is finally SAFE!); they want men to play in women’s sports; they want “TRANSGENDER” for everybody and; if they don’t get them; they are not going to open the Government. Just today the House Democrats voted against condemning the political assassination of Charlie Kirk. Republicans won the Popular Vote; won all seven Swing States; won the Electoral College by a landslide; won most U.S. Counties in a landslide (2;600 to 525). Democrats must start respecting our Democracy; and the Will of the Voters!

0,Why was the wonderful Turning Point under INVESTIGATION by “Deranged” Jack Smith and the Corrupt &amp; Incompetent Biden Administration. They tried to force Charlie; and many other people and movements; out of business. They Weaponized the Justice Department against Sleepy Joe Biden’s Political Opponents; including ME! They allowed the daughter of a Judge; on one of the corrupt trials against me; to become the biggest fund raiser for Biden and Kamala; making many Millions of Dollars for herself and her family; but with her father; the Judge; not only refusing to RECUSE himself; but putting a gag order on me; not allowing ANY talk about their family corruption and unprecedented conflict of interest. Every leading legal analyst and pundit said this trial was wrong and should not have been allowed to go forward. But it did because of a Corrupt Judge who  will hopefully pay a very big price for his illegal actions; someday!

0,BREAKING NEWS! In a Big WIN for Justice and Law in Georgia; the Georgia Supreme Court just ruled that District Attorney Fani Willis and her “team” of Weaponized Prosecutors are DISQUALIFIED; once and for all; from the Fake Witch Hunt against me; and many other Great American Patriots; people that were treated so unfairly; and indeed; viciously. Willis and her lover; Nathan Wade; who she hired even though he was completely unqualified and had never prosecuted such a case before; blatantly lied; under oath; about their torrid “love” affair; the ridiculous amounts of money she paid him; their Caribbean vacations together; her clear Campaign Finance violations; unlawfully taking money from the honest Taxpayers of Georgia; and; most importantly; about their obsession with doing anything and everything they can to “GET TRUMP;” which included destroying the lives of many other people. Just like the purely political; lawless; and dismissed Witch Hunts brought through the Biden White House by Deranged Jack Smith; and others; this Unconstitutional Georgia Hoax; together with the remaining Shams in New York; should now be dead for good. The Prosecutorial Weaponization of DONALD J. TRUMP had no limits. They went after their Political Opponent at levels never seen before; and LOST. They are now CRIMINALS who will hopefully pay serious consequences for their illegal actions. Our Country was dead a year ago; in large part because of the illegal Weaponization of the American Justice System by the Radical Left Democrats. As we end illegal Political Lawfare; the U.S.A. is BACK now; bigger and better than ever before. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! President DJT

0,Shockingly; I have just learned; that Gavin Newscum; the Governor of California; is in final stages of approval to build Low Income Housing in Pacific Palisades. How unfair is that to the people that have suffered so much! Newscum allowed their houses to burn by not accepting Hundreds of Millions of Gallons of Water from the Pacific Northwest; and now; the Low Income Housing starts rising long before he gets Permits for California Citizens to rebuild; but long after the Federal Permits were issued. Lee Zeldin; EPA Administrator; and I; as President; have done the job; and produced all Permits long before anybody expected that to happen. Unfortunately; the Governor of California and Mayor Karen Bass failed you. Gavin Newscum’s plan to build Low Income Housing (at the Super Luxury Pacific Palisades Fire Site) is what caused the destruction of the Late; Great New York City Mayor John Lindsay’s Political Career — and John Lindsay was a Republican.

0,RT @realDonaldTrumpI have just read a News Report that Hamas has moved the hostages above ground to use them as human shields against Israel’s ground offensive. I hope the Leaders of Hamas know what they’re getting into if they do such a thing. This is a human atrocity; the likes of which few people have ever seen before. Don’t let this happen or; ALL “BETS” ARE OFF. RELEASE ALL HOSTAGES NOW!

0,RT @mrddmiaBiden imported--and even housed in 4-star hotels--the most dangerous terrorists and vicious gang members in the Western hemisphere.Trump promised during the campaign to send them the hell out of our country.We The People liked what we heard.We elected Trump; with an overwhelming electoral mandate.312 electoral votes.The popular vote.Trump kept the House.Trump won a comfortable margin in the Senate.Trump is delivering on his immigration promises.In America; We The People are the sovereign citizens.We are not subjects; who get the sovereignty crumbs from government; like the country from which we escaped; declared our independence; and won the Revolutionary War.America is a radical different model; which is what makes us the greatest country in human history.Sovereign power flows from God to We The People.Unlike Great Britain; where sovereign power flows from God to the king or queen.We The People loan power to our governments; through the loan agreement called the U.S. Constitution.We don't get grants of power from a king or queen; through documents like the Magna Carta.And we only loan our governments specific; enumerated; and divided powers.One of our most crucial sovereign powers as We The People is controlling our border and population.We don't want to become Europe; remaking the population with Islamist invaders who hate us.We The Power never gave away to federal judges our sovereign power to control our border and population.Never.Not at our founding.Not after the Civil War.Not in any Congress since then.Certainly not after the last election.Biden illegally mass-imported over 10 million illegal aliens.The Supreme Court refused to stop him.Now Trump is trying to fix this for We The People; as he promised.Federal judges must understand stopping him is a red line.I don't give a damn what justices unthinkingly decided in a sloppy; legislative decision on their emergency docket; as if they were debating and passing legislation as amateur senators.There is no Fifth Amendment constitutional right as it relates to the expulsion of illegal aliens--especially foreign terrorists.Period.Because We The People; as the sovereign citizens; never; ever agreed to that.Illegal aliens only have due-process rights afforded to them by Congress.And the President has Article II power; as the commander-in-chief; to expel a foreign invasion of terrorists--no matter what any statute says.That is his constitutional duty.These judges are violating We the People's most crucial sovereign right to control our border and population.This is 100% unacceptable.https://x.com/nayibbukele/status/1901245427216978290

0,RT @realDonaldTrumpThe only reason crime is somewhat down in Memphis is because the FBI; and others in the Federal Government; at my direction; have been working there for 5 months - on the absolutely terrible Crime numbers. Likewise; in Chicago and Los Angeles! But the real work by us has barely begun. That happens after we make the official announcement that WE’RE COMING; and when we do that; as we did in now VERY SAFE WASHINGTON; D.C.; the no crime “miracle” begins. ONLY I CAN SAVE THEM!!! Thank you for your attention to this matter. President DJT
0,RT @realDonaldTrumpWhen Foreign Companies who are building extremely complex products; machines; and various other “things;” come into the United States with massive Investments; I want them to bring their people of expertise for a period of time to teach and train our people how to make these very unique and complex products; as they phase out of our Country; and back into their land. If we didn’t do this; all of that massive Investment will never come in the first place — Chips; Semiconductors; Computers; Ships; Trains; and so many other products that we have to learn from others how to make; or; in many cases; relearn; because we used to be great at it; but not anymore. For example; Shipbuilding; where we used to build a Ship a day and now; we barely build a Ship a year. I don’t want to frighten off or disincentivize Investment into America by outside Countries or Companies. We welcome them; we welcome their employees; and we are willing to proudly say we will learn from them; and do even better than them at their own “game;” sometime into the not too distant future!
0,Today; I have the Great Honor of bringing a $15 Billion Dollar Defamation and Libel Lawsuit against The New York Times; one of the worst and most degenerate newspapers in the History of our Country; becoming a virtual “mouthpiece” for the Radical Left Democrat Party. I view it as the single largest illegal Campaign contribution; EVER. Their Endorsement of Kamala Harris was actually put dead center on the front page of The New York Times; something heretofore UNHEARD OF! The “Times” has engaged in a decades long method of lying about your Favorite President (ME!); my family; business; the America First Movement; MAGA; and our Nation as a whole. I am PROUD to hold this once respected “rag” responsible; as we are doing with the Fake News Networks such as our successful litigation against George Slopadopoulos/ABC/Disney; and 60 Minutes/CBS/Paramount; who knew that they were falsely “smearing” me through a highly sophisticated system of document and visual alteration; which was; in effect; a malicious form of defamation; and thus; settled for record amounts. They practiced this longterm INTENT and pattern of abuse; which is both unacceptable and illegal. The New York Times has been allowed to freely lie; smear; and defame me for far too long; and that stops; NOW! The suit is being brought in the Great State of Florida. Thank you for your attention to this matter. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

0,This morning; on my Orders; U.S. Military Forces conducted a SECOND Kinetic Strike against positively identified; extraordinarily violent drug trafficking cartels and narcoterrorists in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility. The Strike occurred while these confirmed narcoterrorists from Venezuela were in International Waters transporting illegal narcotics (A DEADLY WEAPON POISONING AMERICANS!) headed to the U.S. These extremely violent drug trafficking cartels POSE A THREAT to U.S. National Security; Foreign Policy; and vital U.S. Interests. The Strike resulted in 3 male terrorists killed in action. No U.S. Forces were harmed in this Strike. BE WARNED — IF YOU ARE TRANSPORTING DRUGS THAT CAN KILL AMERICANS; WE ARE HUNTING YOU! The illicit activities by these cartels have wrought DEVASTATING CONSEQUENCES ON AMERICAN COMMUNITIES FOR DECADES; killing millions of American Citizens. NO LONGER. Thank you for your attention to this matter!!!
0,Congressional Republicans; including Leader John Thune and Speaker Mike Johnson; are working on a short term “CLEAN” extension of Government Funding to stop Cryin’ Chuck Schumer from shutting down the Government. In times like these; Republicans have to stick TOGETHER to fight back against the Radical Left Democrat demands; and vote “YES!” on both Votes needed to pass a Clean CR this week out of the House of Representatives.

After suffering catastrophic injuries from an IED in Afghanistan on April 24; 2010; Michael endured 120 surgeries with unwavering Courage; and the strong support of his incredible wife; Sarah; and three beautiful daughters. Sarah’s tireless advocacy for Wounded Warriors and Military Families exemplifies the Spirit of America. Michael's Legacy of Resilience; and Sarah's Selfless Dedication; will forever inspire us. Brave Patriots like Michael; and their families; will never be forgotten. We will cherish them in our hearts; forever!

0,Subject to SEC Approval; Companies and Corporations should no longer be forced to “Report” on a quarterly basis (Quarterly Reporting!); but rather to Report on a “Six (6) Month Basis.” This will save money; and allow managers to focus on properly running their companies. Did you ever hear the statement that; “China has a 50 to 100 year view on management of a company; whereas we run our companies on a quarterly basis???” Not good!!!
0,The NFL has to get rid of that ridiculous looking new Kickoff Rule. How can they make such a big and sweeping change so easily and quickly. It’s at least as dangerous as the “normal” kickoff; and looks like hell. The ball is moving; and the players are not; the exact opposite of what football is all about. “Sissy” football is bad for America; and bad for the NFL! Who comes up with these ridiculous ideas? It’s like wanting to “roll back” the golf ball so it doesn’t go (nearly!) as far. Fortunately; college football will remain the same; hopefully forever!!
0,Governor Kathy Hochul of New York has Endorsed the “Liddle’ Communist;” Zohran Mamdani; running for Mayor of New York. This is a rather shocking development; and a very bad one for New York City.

0,The Federal Government; under my auspices as President of the United States of America; has stepped into the complete criminal mess that was Washington; D.C.; our Nation’s Capital. Because of this; D.C. has gone from one of the most dangerous and murder ridden cities in the U.S.A.; and even around the World; to one of the safest - In just a few weeks. The “place” is absolutely booming; with restaurants; stores; and businesses packed and; for the first time in decades; virtually NO CRIME. It has been a beautiful thing to watch but; now; under pressure from the Radical Left Democrats; Mayor Muriel Bowser; who has presided over this violent criminal takeover of our Capital for years; has informed the Federal Government that the Metropolitan Police Department will no longer cooperate with ICE in removing and relocating dangerous illegal aliens. If I allowed this to happen; CRIME would come roaring back. To the people and businesses of Washington; D.C.; DON’T WORRY; I AM WITH YOU; AND WON’T ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN. I’ll call a National Emergency; and Federalize; if necessary!!! Thank you for your attention to this matter. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!! President DJT
0,I am aware of the terrible reports regarding the murder of Chandra Nagamallaiah; a well respected person in Dallas; Texas; who was brutally beheaded; in front of his wife and son; by an ILLEGAL ALIEN from Cuba who should have never been in our Country. This individual was previously arrested for terrible crimes; including child sex abuse; grand theft auto; and false imprisonment; but was released back into our Homeland under incompetent Joe Biden because Cuba did not want such an evil person in their Country. Rest assured; the time for being soft on these Illegal Immigrant Criminals is OVER under my watch! Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem; Attorney General Pam Bondi; Border Czar Tom Homan; and many others in my Administration; are doing an incredible job in; MAKING AMERICA SAFE AGAIN. This criminal; who we have in custody; will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law. He will be charged with murder in the first degree!
0,It was my Great Honor to write the Foreword for George “Tyrus” Murdoch’s (Is he related to Rupert Murdoch?) new Book; “WHAT IT IS; AMERICA.” I have been fortunate in getting to know Tyrus; and he is a very smart and talented guy — And also a very good man. Throughout his career in Professional Wrestling and Television; he has earned the respect and admiration of millions. While Late Night Television Ratings have rapidly declined for others; Tyrus; working with the incredible Greg Gutfeld; and a group of wonderful people; have created something very special — A Late Night Show that is destroying Traditional Late Night Television; and the Radical Left who preside over it; in TV Ratings and beyond. Tyrus; using his iconic Wit; Humor; and Charm; to target the Deranged Trump Haters; and their joyless campaign against the American Way of Life; Liberty; and the Pursuit of Happiness; is a STAR. He became famous for saying; long before the Election; “Why we are talking about the 2024 Presidential Election? It’s OVER. TRUMP is going to win; and everyone knows it. It’s a waste of time to talk about it. They’re not going to beat him; and they never will.” I used to laugh when I heard it; but he was right. In his wonderful new Book; Tyrus tells the true story of the 2024 Presidential Election; with his own unique insights; strongly rooted in Common Sense and Love for our Country. This Book is fantastic — Enjoy! Pre-Order today: https://a.co/d/ef3e2av

0,A LETTER SENT BY PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP TO ALL NATO NATIONS AND; THE WORLD: “I am ready to do major Sanctions on Russia when all NATO Nations have agreed; and started; to do the same thing; and when all NATO Nations STOP BUYING OIL FROM RUSSIA. As you know; NATO’S commitment to WIN has been far less than 100%; and the purchase of Russian Oil; by some; has been shocking! It greatly weakens your negotiating position; and bargaining power; over Russia. Anyway; I am ready to “go” when you are. Just say when? I believe that this; plus NATO; as a group; placing 50% to 100% TARIFFS ON CHINA; to be fully withdrawn after the WAR with Russia and Ukraine is ended; will also be of great help in ENDING this deadly; but RIDICULOUS; WAR. China has a strong control; and even grip; over Russia; and these powerful Tariffs will break that grip. This is not TRUMP’S WAR (it would never have  started if I was President!); it is Biden’s and Zelenskyy’s WAR. I am only here to help stop it; and save thousands of Russian and Ukrainian lives (7;118 lives lost last week; alone. CRAZY!). If NATO does as I say; the WAR will end quickly; and all of those lives will be saved! If not; you are just wasting my time; and the time; energy; and money of the United States. Thank you for your attention to this matter! DONALD J. TRUMP; PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.”

THANK YOU to Senators Marshall and Moran; the Republican Members of Congress; and the Republican State Legislature; who I pay very close attention to; for their advocacy for these important recovery funds — It is my Great Honor to do so. I LOVE KANSAS!

Senator Tedd Budd; future Senator Michael Whatley; and all of our incredible North Carolina Republicans have asked for this; and I am happy to do it — North Carolinians deserve it. I just notified Governor Stein; and I fully expect he will make sure the funds are used to help the State recover quickly. The last Democrat Governor; Roy Cooper; who now wants to be Senator; did a terrible job with all of the Storms and massive Water Damage to the State. We came in on January 20th; and did a great job of bringing North Carolina BACK. Michael Whatley and Ted Budd were of great help. Thank you for your attention to this matter!

0,This morning; the Trump Administration was notified by the United States Military that Israel was attacking Hamas which; very unfortunately; was located in a section of Doha; the Capital of Qatar. This was a decision made by Prime Minister Netanyahu; it was not a decision made by me. Unilaterally bombing inside Qatar; a Sovereign Nation and close Ally of the United States; that is working very hard and bravely taking risks with us to broker Peace; does not advance Israel or America’s goals. However; eliminating Hamas; who have profited off the misery of those living in Gaza; is a worthy goal. I immediately directed Special Envoy Steve Witkoff to inform the Qataris of the impending attack; which he did; however; unfortunately; too late to stop the attack. I view Qatar as a strong Ally and friend of the U.S.; and feel very badly about the location of the attack. I want ALL of the Hostages; and bodies of the dead; released; and this War to END; NOW! I also spoke to Prime Minister Netanyahu after the attack. The Prime Minister told me that he wants to make Peace. I believe this unfortunate incident could serve as an opportunity for PEACE. I also spoke to the Emir and Prime Minister of Qatar; and thanked them for their support and friendship to our Country. I assured them that such a thing will not happen again on their soil. I have directed Secretary of State; Marco Rubio; to finalize the Defense Cooperation Agreement with Qatar. Thank you for your attention to this matter!

The perpetrator was a well known career criminal; who had been previously arrested and released on CASHLESS BAIL in January; a total of 14 TIMES. What the hell was he doing riding the train; and walking the streets? Criminals like this need to be LOCKED UP. The blood of this innocent woman can literally be seen dripping from the killer’s knife; and now her blood is on the hands of the Democrats who refuse to put bad people in jail; including Former Disgraced Governor and “Wannabe Senator” Roy Cooper. North Carolina; and every State; needs LAW AND ORDER; and only Republicans will deliver it! Additionally; where is the outrage from the Mainstream Media on this horrible tragedy?

0,6 people were murdered in Chicago this weekend; 12 others were shot; and in serious condition. This would mean that over the past number of weeks; approximately 50 people were killed; and hundreds were shot; many expected to die. Governor Pritzker just stated that he doesn’t want Federal Government HELP! WHY??? What is wrong with this guy; and the 5% in Polls Mayor. I want to help the people of Chicago; not hurt them. Only the Criminals will be hurt! We can move fast and stop this madness. The City and State have not been able to do the job. People of Illinois should band together and DEMAND PROTECTION. IT IS ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE!!! ACT NOW; BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE!!! Thank you for your attention to this matter. President DJT

A Loving Wife and Proud Mother of two sons; Ashley is a wonderful person; has ALWAYS delivered for Iowa; and will continue doing so in the United States Senate. She is working hard to Create Jobs; Cut Taxes; Promote Products and Services MADE IN AMERICA by our incredible Iowa Workers; Support our Great Farmers and American Agriculture; Champion Innovation; Continue to Help Secure our now very Secure Southern Border; Stop Migrant Crime; Murderers; and other Criminals from illegally entering our Country; Strengthen our Military/Veterans; and Defend our always under siege Second Amendment. Ashley Hinson will be an outstanding Senator; and has my Complete and Total Endorsement – SHE WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN!
0,The Democrats have gone CRAZY.
0,In addition to my previously posted TRUTH concerning Google; please let this Statement serve to represent that Google has also paid; in the past; $13 Billion Dollars in false claims and charges for a total of $16.5 Billion Dollars. How crazy is that? The European Union must stop this practice against American Companies; IMMEDIATELY!
0,Europe today “hit” another great American company; Google; with a $3.5 Billion Dollar fine; effectively taking money that would otherwise go to American Investments and Jobs. This is on top of the many other Fines and Taxes that have been issued against Google and other American Tech Companies; in particular. Very unfair; and the American Taxpayer will not stand for it! As I have said before; my Administration will NOT allow these discriminatory actions to stand. Apple; as an example; was forced to pay $17 Billion Dollars in a Fine that; in my opinion; should not have been charged — They should get their money back! We cannot let this happen to brilliant and unprecedented American Ingenuity and; if it does; I will be forced to start a Section 301 proceeding to nullify the unfair penalties being charged to these Taxpaying American Companies. Thank you for your attention to this matter!DONALD J. TRUMP; PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

0,The confused and badly failing Democrat Party did nothing about Jeffrey Epstein while he was alive except befriend him; socialize with him; travel to his Island; and take his money! They knew everything there was to know about Epstein; but now; years after his death; they; out of nowhere; are seeming to show such love and heartfelt concern for his victims. Does anybody really believe that? Where were they during his very public trials; and for all of those years before his death? The answer is; “nowhere to be found.” The now dying (after the DOJ gave thousands of pages of documents in full compliance with a very comprehensive and exacting Subpoena from Congress!) Epstein case was only brought back to life by the Radical Left Democrats because they are doing so poorly; with the lowest poll numbers in the history of the Party (16%); while the Republicans are doing so well; among the highest approval numbers the Party has ever had! The Dems don’t care about the victims; as proven by the fact that they never did before. This is merely another Democrat HOAX; just like Russia; Russia; Russia; and all of the others; in order to deflect and distract from the great success of a Republican President; and the record setting failure of the previous Administration; and the Democrat Party. The Department of Justice has done its job; they have given everything requested of them. It’s time to end the Democrat Epstein Hoax; and give the Republicans credit for the great; even legendary; job that they are doing. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!
0,Jerry Nadler; one of the most disgusting Congressmen in USA History is; at long last; calling it “quits” - He’s finally leaving Congress! I’ve been beating this bum for 40 years; first as a New York City developer; where he opposed me; for no reason; at every corner; but could NEVER stop me from getting the job done; and then; as your President; where this psychopathic nut job; together with Crazy Nancy Pelosi; Impeached me twice; AND LOST; wasting Millions of Dollars in time and taxpayer money.

0,Earlier this morning; on my Orders; U.S. Military Forces conducted a kinetic strike against positively identified Tren de Aragua Narcoterrorists in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility. TDA is a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization; operating under the control of Nicolas Maduro; responsible for mass murder; drug trafficking; sex trafficking; and acts of violence and terror across the United States and Western Hemisphere. The strike occurred while the terrorists were at sea in International waters transporting illegal narcotics; heading to the United States. The strike resulted in 11 terrorists killed in action. No U.S. Forces were harmed in this strike. Please let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America. BEWARE! Thank you for your attention to this matter!!!!!!!!!!!

0,What few people understand is that we do very little business with India; but they do a tremendous amount of business with us. In other words; they sell us massive amounts of goods; their biggest “client;” but we sell them very little - Until now a totally one sided relationship; and it has been for many decades. The reason is that India has charged us; until now; such high Tariffs; the most of any country; that our businesses are unable to sell into India. It has been a totally one sided disaster! Also; India buys most of its oil and military products from Russia; very little from the U.S. They have now offered to cut their Tariffs to nothing; but it’s getting late. They should have done so years ago. Just some simple facts for people to ponder!!!
0,It is very important that the Drug Companies justify the success of their various Covid Drugs. Many people think they are a miracle that saved Millions of lives. Others disagree! With CDC being ripped apart over this question; I want the answer; and I want it NOW. I have been shown information from Pfizer; and others; that is extraordinary; but they never seem to show those results to the public. Why not??? They go off to the next “hunt” and let everyone rip themselves apart; including Bobby Kennedy Jr. and CDC; trying to figure out the success or failure of the Drug Companies Covid work. They show me GREAT numbers and results; but they don’t seem to be showing them to many others. I want them to show them NOW; to CDC and the public; and clear up this MESS; one way or the other!!! I hope OPERATION WARP SPEED was as “BRILLIANT” as many say it was. If not; we all want to know about it; and why??? Thank you for your attention to this very important matter! President DJT
0,Wow! Mayor Muriel Bowser of D.C. has become very popular because she worked with me and my great people in bringing CRIME down to virtually NOTHING in D.C. Her statements and actions were positive; instead of others like Pritzker; Wes Moore; Newscum; and the 5% approval rated Mayor of Chicago; who spend all of their time trying to justify violent Crime; instead of working with us to completely ELIMINATE it; which we have done in Washington; D.C.;  NOW A CRIME FREE ZONE. Wouldn’t it be nice to say that about Chicago; Los Angeles; New York; and even the Crime Drenched City of Baltimore??? It can happen; and it can happen FAST! Work with us!!! Mayor Bowser’s ratings have gone up; in a short period of time; 25%; and the people of D.C. are thanking her for stopping crime wherever she goes. It’s not a miracle; it’s hard work; courage; and being SMART. The top Law Enforcement Officer in L.A. said; during the riots; and when I sent the troops in early; that they couldn’t have done it without us. They were completely overwhelmed! If we hadn’t gone in early; on top of the Palisades plus fires; L.A. would have lost the Olympics. Congratulations to Mayor Muriel Bowser; but don’t go Woke on us. D.C. is a GIANT VICTORY that never has to end!!!

Never took drugs; there is no proof that he took drugs; has steadfastly refused that he took drugs. Frankly; I think he has a major lawsuit against Baseball. If it were me; I’d sue them. PUT ROGER CLEMENS IN THE HALL OF FAME; NOW — NOT LIKE YOU DID WITH PETE ROSE; WHEN YOU WAITED UNTIL HE WAS DEAD! That wasn’t the deal I made with the Commissioner; Rob Manfred; many months before he died. The deal was that he was going to be put up; immediately; but they waited and waited and waited; and then; put him up because of “death.” It shouldn’t have been because of death; it should have been because of TALENT! This is not going to happen with Roger Clemens.

0,I used; at the White House; the most beautiful marble and stone available anywhere. Surfaces are very important to me as a Builder. As everyone knows; I built many GREAT Buildings; and other things; over the years. At the White House; I am very proud of the beautiful stonework we did in the Rose Garden; in this case; using limestone plus. The Rose Garden is completed; and far more beautiful than anyone ever had in mind when it was conceived of; decades ago. Three days ago; while admiring the stonework; I happened to notice a huge gash in the limestone that extended more than 25 yards long. It was deep and nasty! I started yelling; “Who did this; and I want to find out now!” — And I didn’t say this in a nice manner. I wondered; “Was it vandalism or; was it stupidity?” Lo and behold; because of the fact that we’ve installed the finest security equipment anywhere; they brought back the stupid people; with their boss watching (in sunglasses!). It was a subcontractor that was installing heavy landscaping on a steel cart that was broken and tilting badly; with it rubbing hard against the soft; beautiful stone. I love and respect great workers and contractors; but something like this should never happen. Now; I’ll replace the stone; charge the contractor; and never let that contractor work at the White House again — But; how great is the video equipment? We caught them; cold. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

0,RT @marklevinshowTHE APPELLATE COURT MAJORITY TARIFF DECISION WAS WRONGThe appellate court majority that ruled against most of the president's tariffs has it wrong.  Whether you like tariffs or not; the act at issue does; in fact; grant the president broad powers to declare an emergency.  Even more; the Constitution; under Article II; grants the president broad powers to make foreign policy.  The president's lawyers are obviously aware of this; which is why the executive orders at issue rely; in part; on serious foreign policy considerations; including; as an example; Mexico; Canada; and China; which the president has determined are not doing enough to prevent the flow of deadly drugs into our country.  The combination of broad authority and Article II powers trump the issues raised by the court's majority.  Moreover; judges should not be the final decision-makers about such matters as they're exercising authority that was never delegated to them; and they should not substitute their own policy preferences for the president's.  The check here is Congress -- that is; if it wishes to amend the law or pass a new law curbing the president's power here.  That said; Congress does not have boundless power; and it could run into separation of powers issues; given Article II and the president's foreign policy authority.  The Supreme Court will; once again; rule on this.  In the past; Justices Thomas; Gorsuch; and Kavanaugh have noted the broad authority of the president in circumstances similar to this.  I expect Justice Alito would concur.
0,ALL TARIFFS ARE STILL IN EFFECT! Today a Highly Partisan Appeals Court incorrectly said that our Tariffs should be removed; but they know the United States of America will win in the end. If these Tariffs ever went away; it would be a total disaster for the Country. It would make us financially weak; and we have to be strong. The U.S.A. will no longer tolerate enormous Trade Deficits and unfair Tariffs and Non Tariff Trade Barriers imposed by other Countries; friend or foe; that undermine our Manufacturers; Farmers; and everyone else. If allowed to stand; this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America. At the start of this Labor Day weekend; we should all remember that TARIFFS are the best tool to help our Workers; and support Companies that produce great MADE IN AMERICA products. For many years; Tariffs were allowed to be used against us by our uncaring and unwise Politicians. Now; with the help of the United States Supreme Court; we will use them to the benefit of our Nation; and Make America Rich; Strong; and Powerful Again! Thank you for your attention to this matter.
0,"GREAT Governor Mike Kehoe; of the Wonderful State of Missouri; which I love and won SIX times; including with1.8 Million Votes in 2024 (by far the most Votes in History!); just called a very Special Session to begin passage of a new; much fairer; and much improved; Congressional Map; that will give the incredible people of Missouri the tremendous opportunity to elect an additional MAGA Republican in the2026 Midterm Elections — A HUGE VICTORY for our America First Agenda; not just in the ""Show-Me State;"" but across our Nation. Remember; I won the 2024 Presidential Election in a landslide; won ALL SEVEN SWING STATES; THE POPULAR VOTE; AND ALL FIFTY STATES SHIFTED REPUBLICAN; a record; and now I have the best polling numbers I've ever had. Our Party has never been more UNITED; and we are getting so much done for the American People because of it; and; therefore; I call on all of my Republican friends in the Missouri Legislature to work as fast as they can to get this new Congressional Map; AS IS; to Governor Mike Kehoe's desk; ASAP.

Christina knows the real story of the Deranged Jack Smith Investigations; and the Raid on Mar-a-Lago; because she lived it; and fought with us to Victory.

0,The Republican Party is doing really well. Millions of people have joined us in our quest to MAKE AMERICA; GREAT AGAIN. We won every aspect of the Presidential Election and; based on the great success we are having; are poised to WIN BIG IN THE MIDTERMS.

0,Monday’s Court Order in Utah is absolutely Unconstitutional. How did such a wonderful Republican State like Utah; which I won in every Election; end up with so many Radical Left Judges? All Citizens of Utah should be outraged at their activist Judiciary; which wants to take away our Congressional advantage; and will do everything possible to do so. This incredible State sent four great Republicans to Congress; and we want to keep it that way. The Utah GOP has to STAY UNITED; and make sure their four terrific Republican Congressmen stay right where they are!

Sarah’s tireless advocacy for Wounded Warriors and Military Families exemplifies the Spirit of America. Michael's Legacy of Resilience; and Sarah's Selfless Dedication; will forever inspire us. Brave Patriots like Michael; and their families; will never be forgotten. We will cherish them in our hearts; forever!

Who would not want to make deals like that?
0,The incompetent Mayor of Chicago just stated that; in DC; where crime has been brought down to almost nothing; there have been no murders in 9 days; something which hasn’t happened in years; and people are safe again; only nine people have been arrested.

0,Why is it that ABC and NBC FAKE NEWS; two of the absolute worst and most biased networks anywhere in the World; aren’t paying Millions of Dollars a year in LICENSE FEES. They should lose their Licenses for their unfair coverage of Republicans and/or Conservatives; but at a minimum; they should pay up BIG for having the privilege of using the most valuable airwaves anywhere at anytime!!! Crooked “journalism” should not be rewarded; it should be terminated!!!
0,Despite a very high popularity and; according to many; among the greatest 8 months in Presidential History; ABC &amp; NBC FAKE NEWS; two of the worst and most biased networks in history; give me 97% BAD STORIES. IF THAT IS THE CASE; THEY ARE SIMPLY AN ARM OF THE DEMOCRAT PARTY AND SHOULD; ACCORDING TO MANY; HAVE THEIR LICENSES REVOKED BY THE FCC. I would be totally in favor of that because they are so biased and untruthful; an actual threat to our Democracy!!! MAGA

0,I have a Constitutional Right to appoint Judges and U.S. Attorneys; but that RIGHT has been completely taken away from me in States that have just one Democrat United States Senator. This is because of an old and outdated “custom” known as a BLUE SLIP; that Senator Chuck Grassley; of the Great State of Iowa; refuses to overturn; even though the Democrats; including Crooked Joe Biden (Twice!); have done so on numerous occasions. Therefore; the only candidates that I can get confirmed for these most important positions are; believe it or not; Democrats! Chuck Grassley should allow strong Republican candidates to ascend to these very vital and powerful roles; and tell the Democrats; as they often tell us; to go to HELL!
0,I just watched Sloppy Chris Christie be interviewed on a ratings challenged “News” Show; “This Week With George Slopadopolus;” on ABC Fake News (By the way; what the “hell” happened to Jonathan Karl’s hair? He looks absolutely terrible! It’s amazing what bad ratings; on a failed television show that was forced to pay me $16;000;000; can do to one’s appearance!). Can anyone believe anything that Sloppy Chris says? Do you remember the way he lied about the dangerous and deadly closure of the George Washington Bridge in order to stay out of prison; at the same time sacrificing people who worked for him; including a young mother; who spent years trying to fight off the vicious charges against her. Chris refused to take responsibility for these criminal acts. For the sake of JUSTICE; perhaps we should start looking at that very serious situation again? NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW! Thank you for your attention to this matter. President DJT
0,The Appellate Court removed incompetent Judge Engoron; but he refused to go; or even to acknowledge them. He’s a highly overturned; CROOKED Judge; who is retiring into a life of lawsuits; along with his Chief Clerk; soon! He is almost as Corrupt as Leticia James; but not quite! President DJT
0,I played Golf yesterday with the Great Roger Clemens and his son; Kacy. Roger Clemens was easily one of the few Greatest Pitchers of All Time; winning 354 Games; the Cy Young Award seven times (A Record; by a lot!); and played in six World Series; winning two! He was second to Nolan Ryan in most strike-outs; and he should be in the Baseball Hall of Fame; NOW! People think he took drugs; but nothing was proven. He never tested positive; and Roger; from the very beginning; totally denies it. He was just as great before those erroneous charges were leveled at him. That rumor has gone on for years; and there has been no evidence whatsoever that he was a “druggie.” This is going to be like Pete Rose where; after over 4;000 Hits; they wouldn’t put him in the Hall of Fame until I spoke to the Commissioner; and he promised to do so; but it was essentially a promise not kept because he only “opened it up” when Pete died and; even then; he said that Pete Rose only got into the mix because of DEATH. We are not going to let that happen in the case of Roger Clemens. 354 Wins — Put him in NOW. He and his great family should not be forced to endure this “stupidity” any longer!

0,Governor Wes Moore of Maryland has asked; in a rather nasty and provocative tone; that I “walk the streets of Maryland” with him. I assume he is talking about out of control; crime ridden; Baltimore? As President; I would much prefer that he clean up this Crime disaster before I go there for a “walk.” Wes Moore’s record on Crime is a very bad one; unless he fudges his figures on crime like many of the other “Blue States” are doing. But if Wes Moore needs help; like Gavin Newscum did in L.A.; I will send in the “troops;” which is being done in nearby DC; and quickly clean up the Crime. After only one week; there is NO CRIME AND NO MURDER IN DC! When it is like that in Baltimore; I will proudly “walk the streets” with the failing; because of Crime; Governor of Maryland. P.S. Baltimore is ranked the 4th WORST CITY IN THE NATION IN CRIME &amp; MURDER. Stop talking and get to work; Wes. I’ll then see you on the streets!!! Also; I gave Wes Moore a lot of money to fix his demolished bridge. I will now have to rethink that decision??? Thank you for your attention to this matter. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! President DJT

0,In many ways; it all started in Mobile; Alabama; 10 years ago today; on August 21; 2015. It was hot; we signed with a ballroom at a hotel; and the hotel said; after one day; “We can’t handle it; we’re being inundated with people; go to the Convention Center.” We went to the Convention Center; it holds 10;000 people; and they called us; and said; “We can’t handle it; we’re being inundated;” and then we went to the Stadium; and the place was PACKED. Tens of thousands of people showed up; and we all had lots of fun together. It seems like a long time ago; but it also seems like yesterday. It was a great day; a great State; and here is the Speech I made on that sweltering evening under the hot Alabama sun.

0,TOTAL VICTORY in the FAKE New York State Attorney General Letitia James Case! I greatly respect the fact that the Court had the Courage to throw out this unlawful and disgraceful Decision that was hurting Business all throughout New York State. Others were afraid to do business there. The amount; including Interest and Penalties; was over $550 Million Dollars. It was a Political Witch Hunt; in a business sense; the likes of which no one has ever seen before. This was a Case of Election Interference by the City and State trying to show; illegally; that I did things that were wrong when; in fact; everything I did was absolutely CORRECT and; even; PERFECT. Every single Dollar was thrown out; even the penalties imposed on us by the Corrupt Judge; one of the most overturned in History; Arthur Engoron. I wasn’t given a Jury and; during the course of the Trial; which lasted a long time; was not given one Ruling in my favor by this Political Hack; but worse than him; if that’s possible; was Letitia James; a Corrupt and Incompetent Attorney General who only brought this Case in order to hurt me politically. She is a Trump Deranged Lunatic! They made me bond the outrageous sum; which never happened before; and which cost me Millions of Dollars a month. It should have never been allowed to happen; and everyone knew it! Importantly; the Vote was 5 to 0. I am so honored by Justice David Friedman’s great words of wisdom; which should be read by everyone. I would also like to thank the Court for having the Courage to make this Decision; which is already going down as one of the worst business persecutions in the History of our Country. Sadly; there are other Cases against me that are equally disgraceful; including those headed up by Corrupt Judges; like Juan Merchan; whose daughter collected Millions of Dollars in Fees from Crooked Joe Biden and Kamala Harris; while her father shockingly REFUSED TO RECUSE himself from a vicious and corrupt trial; which is also under Appeal; one in which every Legal Pundit in New York said; “THERE WAS NO CASE!” — Even Editorial Boards said; “DO NOT DO THIS!” Judge Merchan gave me an unprecedented Gag Order; not letting me talk about him or his daughter; or the fact that the Appellate Judges thought he should not be doing the Case; but he did it anyway. Many Lawyers said that his daughter and him created the Greatest Conflict of Interest they had ever seen. Judge Lewis Kaplan; the other remaining Case; whose wife; family; and friends attended his two trials; is as mean and nasty as anyone I have ever met. That Case; also on Appeal; should also never have been brought; and he should be admonished for Abuse; and every other thing that can be thrown at a Corrupt Judge. He loved the publicity; and would not let us present the irrefutable evidence that we wanted to present. This Clinton appointed Judge should not be allowed to get away with this SCAM….
0,….These were all Political Trials in an effort to destroy my viability as a Presidential Candidate before; during; and after the Election. They were strongly coordinated with the Biden/Harris Campaign; and will go down in History as among the most Corrupt Cases ever brought. These two Cases are even more ridiculous than the Corrupt Letitia James Case; and will be found out to be so in the very near future. All of these Judges should be ashamed of themselves for allowing them to happen. They are Political Hacks who did everything possible to hurt me as a Candidate. This was an attack by the Biden/Harris Administration on their Political Opponent; ME. It is such an Honor to have withstood it; thrived; and even become President of the United States despite the horrible things that were done to me. I’d like to thank and congratulate my son Eric Trump; and all of the many people in the Trump Organization; that fought so strongly for Justice. My Legal Team refused to give up against heavy odds. This is a Great Day for New York City and State!
0,A GREAT WIN FOR AMERICA!!!
0,It is very hard; if not impossible; to win a war without attacking an invaders country. It’s like a great team in sports that has a fantastic defense; but is not allowed to play offense. There is no chance of winning! It is like that with Ukraine and Russia. Crooked and grossly incompetent Joe Biden would not let Ukraine FIGHT BACK; only DEFEND. How did that work out? Regardless; this is a war that would have NEVER happened if I were President - ZERO CHANCE. Interesting times ahead!!! President DJT
0,FREE TINA PETERS; a brave and innocent Patriot who has been tortured by Crooked Colorado politicians; including the big Mail-In Ballot supporting the governor of the State.

If she is not released; I am going to take harsh measures!!!

0,Big WIN for the Great State of Texas!!! Everything Passed; on our way to FIVE more Congressional seats and saving your Rights; your Freedoms; and your Country; itself. Texas never lets us down. Florida; Indiana; and others are looking to do the same thing. More seats equals less Crime; a great Economy; and a STRONG SECOND AMENDMENT. It means Happiness and Peace. But Republicans; there is one thing even better - STOP MAIL-IN VOTING; a total fraud that has no bounds. Also; go to PAPER BALLOTS before it is too late - At one tenth the cost; faster; and more reliable. If we do these TWO things; we will pick up 100 more seats; and the CROOKED game of politics is over. God Bless America!!!

We are not going to allow this to happen; and I have instructed my attorneys to go through the Museums; and start the exact same process that has been done with Colleges and Universities where tremendous progress has been made.

0,Ursula von der Leyen; the distinguished and Highly Respected President of the European Commission; and I have been discussing the massive Worldwide problem of missing children. This is; likewise; a big subject with my wife; Melania. It is a subject at the top of all lists; and the World will work together to solve it; hopefully bringing them home to their families!
0,I had a very good meeting with distinguished guests; President Volodymyr Zelenskyy; of Ukraine; President Emmanuel Macron; of France; President Alexander Stubb; of Finland; Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni; of Italy; Prime Minister Keir Starmer; of the United Kingdom; Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany; Friedrich Merz; President of the European Commission; Ursula von der Leyen; and Secretary General of NATO; Mark Rutte; in the White House; which ended in a further meeting in the Oval Office. During the meeting we discussed Security Guarantees for Ukraine; which Guarantees would be provided by the various European Countries; with a coordination with the United States of America. Everyone is very happy about the possibility of PEACE for Russia/Ukraine. At the conclusion of the meetings; I called President Putin; and began the arrangements for a meeting; at a location to be determined; between President Putin and President Zelenskyy. After that meeting takes place; we will have a Trilat; which would be the two Presidents; plus myself. Again; this was a very good; early step for a War that has been going on for almost four years. Vice President JD Vance; Secretary of State Marco Rubio; and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff; are coordinating with Russia and Ukraine. Thank you for your attention to this matter!

0,I’ve settled 6 Wars in 6 months; one of them a possible Nuclear disaster; and yet I have to read &amp; listen to the Wall Street Journal; and many other who truly don’t have a clue; tell me everything that I am doing wrong on the Russia/Ukraine MESS; that is Sleepy Joe Biden’s war; not mine. I’m only here to stop it; not to prosecute it any further. It would have NEVER happened if I was President. I know exactly what I’m doing; and I don’t need the advice of people who have been working on all of these conflicts for years; and were never able to do a thing to stop them. They are “STUPID” people; with no common sense; intelligence; or understanding; and they only make the current R/U disaster more difficult to FIX. Despite all of my lightweight and very jealous critics; I’ll get it done — I always do!!! President DJT
0,I am totally convinced that if Russia raised their hands and said; “We give up; we concede; we surrender; we will GIVE Ukraine and the great United States of America; the most revered; respected; and powerful of all countries; EVER; Moscow and St. Petersburg; and everything surrounding them for a thousand miles; the Fake News Media and their Democrat Partners would say that this was a bad and humiliating day for Donald J. Trump; one of the worst days in the history of our Country.” But that’s why they are the FAKE NEWS; and the badly failing Radical Left Democrats. Thank you for your attention to this matter!!!
0,D.C. gave Fake Crime numbers in order to create a false illusion of safety. This is a very bad and dangerous thing to do; and they are under serious investigation for so doing!

Now; in just a short period of time; it is perhaps the safest; and getting better every single hour! People are flocking to D.C. again; and soon; the beautification will begin!

We are now the only Country in the World that uses Mail-In Voting. All others gave it up because of the MASSIVE VOTER FRAUD ENCOUNTERED. WE WILL BEGIN THIS EFFORT; WHICH WILL BE STRONGLY OPPOSED BY THE DEMOCRATS BECAUSE THEY CHEAT AT LEVELS NEVER SEEN BEFORE; by signing an EXECUTIVE ORDER to help bring HONESTY to the 2026 Midterm Elections. Remember; the States are merely an “agent” for the Federal Government in counting and tabulating the votes. They must do what the Federal Government; as represented by the President of the United States; tells them; FOR THE GOOD OF OUR COUNTRY; to do. With their HORRIBLE Radical Left policies; like Open Borders; Men Playing in Women’s Sports; Transgender and “WOKE” for everyone; and so much more; Democrats are virtually Unelectable without using this completely disproven Mail-In SCAM. ELECTIONS CAN NEVER BE HONEST WITH MAIL IN BALLOTS/VOTING; and everybody; IN PARTICULAR THE DEMOCRATS; KNOWS THIS. I; AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY; WILL FIGHT LIKE HELL TO BRING HONESTY AND INTEGRITY BACK TO OUR ELECTIONS. THE MAIL-IN BALLOT HOAX; USING VOTING MACHINES THAT ARE A COMPLETE AND TOTAL DISASTER; MUST END; NOW!!! REMEMBER; WITHOUT FAIR AND HONEST ELECTIONS; AND STRONG AND POWERFUL BORDERS; YOU DON’T HAVE EVEN A SEMBLANCE OF A COUNTRY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER!!! DONALD J.

Actually; he would have loved doing the meeting anywhere else but the U.S.; and the Fake News knows this. It was a major point of contention! If we had the Summit elsewhere; the Democrat run and controlled media would have said what a terrible thing THAT was. These people are sick! They even want CRIME IN D.C.; and other BLUE Cities throughout our Country; but don’t worry; I won’t let that happen.

0,A great and very successful day in Alaska! The meeting with President Vladimir Putin of Russia went very well; as did a late night phone call with President Zelenskyy of Ukraine; and various European Leaders; including the highly respected Secretary General of NATO. It was determined by all that the best way to end the horrific war between Russia and Ukraine is to go directly to a Peace Agreement; which would end the war; and not a mere Ceasefire Agreement; which often times do not hold up. President Zelenskyy will be coming to D.C.; the Oval Office; on Monday afternoon. If all works out; we will then schedule a meeting with President Putin. Potentially; millions of people’s lives will be saved. Thank you for your attention to this matter!

0,Washington; D.C.; has one of the Highest Rates of Crime in the World; more than many of the most violent Third World Countries. The City’s Homicide Rate is higher than places notorious for their violence; such as Mexico City; Bogota; Islamabad; and Addis Ababa — Almost ten times higher than Fallujah; Iraq. If D.C. were a State; it would have the highest Homicide Rate of any State in America. The Violent Crime Rate in D.C. has worsened; and the Murder Rate has essentially DOUBLED in just over a decade — But these are only the “official” statistics released by corrupt City Officials. The REAL numbers are many times worse. In fact; a Precinct Commander was just suspended for allegedly manipulating the Violent Crime Statistics; and the D.C. Police Union; likewise; says the real numbers are much higher. Because the Democrat Government of D.C. has largely stopped investigating; arresting; and prosecuting most Crime; the published statistics don’t even capture a fraction of the actual Violence. No one is arrested for shoplifting. Citizens living in fear have largely given up on calling the Police; instead choosing not to walk the streets after dark; essentially becoming captive prisoners in their own City. Stores lock up their merchandise behind glass walls. Gang Youth Violence is so common it goes largely unreported. Vehicle Theft in D.C. is more than three times the National Average. Schools are completely dysfunctional. Citizens are afraid to speak up or; call the Police; lest they be targeted. The REAL Crime Rates are probably five to ten times what has been reported. D.C. has been under siege from thugs and killers; but now; D.C. is back under Federal Control where it belongs. The White House is in charge. The Military and our Great Police will liberate this City; scrape away the filth; and make it safe; clean; habitable and beautiful once more!

We are winning on EVERYTHING. The Fake News is working overtime (No tax on overtime!). If I got Moscow and Leningrad free; as part of the deal with Russia; the Fake News would say that I made a bad deal! But now they’ve been caught. Look at all of the real news that’s coming out about their CORRUPTION. They are sick and dishonest people; who probably hate our Country. But it doesn’t matter because we are winning on everything!!!

0,Trillions of Dollars are being taken in on Tariffs; which has been incredible for our Country; its Stock Market; its General Wealth; and just about everything else. It has been proven; that even at this late stage; Tariffs have not caused Inflation; or any other problems for America; other than massive amounts of CASH pouring into our Treasury’s coffers. Also; it has been shown that; for the most part; Consumers aren’t even paying these Tariffs; it is mostly Companies and Governments; many of them Foreign; picking up the tabs. But David Solomon and Goldman Sachs refuse to give credit where credit is due. They made a bad prediction a long time ago on both the Market repercussion and the Tariffs themselves; and they were wrong; just like they are wrong about so much else. I think that David should go out and get himself a new Economist or; maybe; he ought to just focus on being a DJ; and not bother running a major Financial Institution.
0,Jerome “Too Late” Powell must NOW lower the rate. Steve “Manouychin” really gave me a “beauty”when he pushed this loser. The damage he has done by always being Too Late is incalculable. Fortunately; the economy is sooo good that we’ve blown through Powell and the complacent Board. I am; though; considering allowing a major lawsuit against Powell to proceed because of the horrible; and grossly incompetent; job he has done in managing the construction of the Fed Buildings. Three Billion Dollars for a job that should have been a $50 Million Dollar fix up. Not good!

0,The Press Conference on Crime and “Beautification” will be held tomorrow; at 10:00 A.M. EST; in the Press Briefing Room; and it will not only involve ending the Crime; Murder; and Death in our Nation’s Capital; but will also be about Cleanliness and the General Physical Renovation and Condition of our once beautiful and well maintained Capital. We are not going to allow people to spend $3.1 Billion Dollars on fixing up a building; like the Federal Reserve; which could have been done in a far more elegant and time sensitive manner for $50 to $100 Million Dollars. The Renovation would have actually been better; and we would have saved $3 Billion Dollars; Traffic Jams; and never-ending Construction. The Mayor of D.C.; Muriel Bowser; is a good person who has tried; but she has been given many chances; and the Crime Numbers get worse; and the City only gets dirtier and less attractive. The American Public is not going to put up with it any longer. Just like I took care of the Border; where you had ZERO Illegals coming across last month; from millions the year before; I will take care of our cherished Capital; and we will make it; truly; GREAT AGAIN! Before the tents; squalor; filth; and Crime; it was the most beautiful Capital in the World. It will soon be that again. Thank you for your attention to this matter — See you tomorrow at 10 A.M.!
0,We’re having a News Conference tomorrow in the White House. I’m going to make our Capital safer and more beautiful than it ever was before. The Homeless have to move out; IMMEDIATELY. We will give you places to stay; but FAR from the Capital. The Criminals; you don’t have to move out. We’re going to put you in jail where you belong. It’s all going to happen very fast; just like the Border. We went from millions pouring in; to ZERO in the last few months. This will be easier — Be prepared! There will be no “MR. NICE GUY.” We want our Capital BACK. Thank you for your attention to this matter!

0,Tariffs are having a huge positive impact on the Stock Market. Almost every day; new records are set. In addition; Hundreds of Billions of Dollars are pouring into our Country’s coffers. If a Radical Left Court ruled against us at this late date; in an attempt to bring down or disturb the largest amount of money; wealth creation and influence the U.S.A. has ever seen; it would be impossible to ever recover; or pay back; these massive sums of money and honor. It would be 1929 all over again; a GREAT DEPRESSION! If they were going to rule against the wealth; strength; and power of America; they should have done so LONG AGO; at the beginning of the case; where our entire Country; while never having a chance at this kind of GREATNESS again; would not have been put in 1929 style jeopardy. There is no way America could recover from such a judicial tragedy; but I know our Court System better than anyone; there is no one in history that has gone through the trials; tribulations and uncertainties such as I; and absolutely terrible; but also amazingly beautiful; things can happen. Our Country deserves SUCCESS AND GREATNESS; NOT TURMOIL; FAILURE; AND DISGRACE. GOD BLESS AMERICA!

It will be a Historic Day for Armenia; Azerbaijan; the United States; and; THE WORLD. See you then! DJT

0,The reason that The Wall Street Journal Editorial Board is always negative on “TRUMP;” and the Hundreds of Billions of Dollars we’re bringing into our Country through Tariffs; numbers that the U.S.A. has never seen before; is because they are China centric or; at a minimum; Globalists; and they would rather see China and the World; for reasons unknown; “WIN; BABY; WIN.” If the United States were not able to charge Tariffs to other Countries; it would be Economically defenseless and; of no further force or effect.

The Law in D.C. must be changed to prosecute these “minors” as adults; and lock them up for a long time; starting at age 14. The most recent victim was beaten mercilessly by local thugs. Washington; D.C.; must be safe; clean; and beautiful for all Americans and; importantly; for the World to see.

He’s a Low IQ individual; has no idea what words are coming out of his mouth; and knows nothing about me or what I have done - like just ending 5 Wars; including a 31 year bloodbath between Republic of the Congo and Rwanda; where Seven Million people have died; and there was no end in sight. He didn’t know that; or India and Pakistan or; wiping out Iran’s nuclear capabilities; or closing the horrendous open Border; or creating the greatest economy; where prices and Inflation have come way down; and where STUPID and CORRUPT JOE BIDEN set the record for doing the Worst Job as President; EVER. But this dope; Charlamagne; would vote for Sleepy Joe or Kamala? Remember; one year ago our Country was DEAD; now it’s the “HOTTEST” Country anywhere in the World. MAGA!!!

0,I’m doing Rob Finnerty tonight; on Newsmax. He has been so terrific; I thought it would be appropriate to do his Show. Enjoy!
0,In my opinion; today’s Jobs Numbers were RIGGED in order to make the Republicans; and ME; look bad — Just like when they had three great days around the 2024 Presidential Election; and then; those numbers were “taken away” on November 15; 2024; right after the Election; when the Jobs Numbers were massively revised DOWNWARD; making a correction of over 818;000 Jobs — A TOTAL SCAM. Jerome “Too Late” Powell is no better! But; the good news is; our Country is doing GREAT!
0,I was just informed that our Country’s “Jobs Numbers” are being produced by a Biden Appointee; Dr. Erika McEntarfer; the Commissioner of Labor Statistics; who faked the Jobs Numbers before the Election to try and boost Kamala’s chances of Victory. This is the same Bureau of Labor Statistics that overstated the Jobs Growth in March 2024 by approximately 818;000 and; then again; right before the 2024 Presidential Election; in August and September; by 112;000. These were Records — No one can be that wrong? We need accurate Jobs Numbers. I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee; IMMEDIATELY. She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified. Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate; they can’t be manipulated for political purposes. McEntarfer said there were only 73;000 Jobs added (a shock!) but; more importantly; that a major mistake was made by them; 258;000 Jobs downward; in the prior two months. Similar things happened in the first part of the year; always to the negative. The Economy is BOOMING under “TRUMP” despite a Fed that also plays games; this time with Interest Rates; where they lowered them twice; and substantially; just before the Presidential Election; I assume in the hopes of getting “Kamala” elected – How did that work out? Jerome “Too Late” Powell should also be put “out to pasture.” Thank you for your attention to this matter!
0,Based on the highly provocative statements of the Former President of Russia; Dmitry Medvedev; who is now the Deputy Chairman of the Security Council of the Russian Federation; I have ordered two Nuclear Submarines to be positioned in the appropriate regions; just in case these foolish and inflammatory statements are more than just that. Words are very important; and can often lead to unintended consequences; I hope this will not be one of those instances. Thank you for your attention to this matter!
0,I have just been informed that almost 20;000 Russian soldiers died this month in the ridiculous War with Ukraine. Russia has lost 112;500 soldiers since the beginning of the year. That is a lot of unnecessary DEATH! Ukraine; however; has also suffered greatly. They have lost approximately 8;000 soldiers since January 1; 2025; and that number does not include their missing. Ukraine has also lost civilians; but in smaller numbers; as Russian rockets crash into Kyiv; and other Ukrainian locales. This is a War that should have never happened — This is Biden’s War; not “TRUMP’s.” I’m just here to see if I can stop it!
0,MAGA Warrior Joe Gruters; who has been with us from the very beginning; is running to become the next Chairman of the Republican National Committee; succeeding the Great Michael Whatley; who just launched his Campaign for the U.S. Senate from North Carolina. As State Senator and Chairman of the Republican Party of Florida; Joe helped us deliver massive and historic Victories across the State; including my three BIG WINS in 2016; 2020; and 2024! As RNC Treasurer; Joe has been a Fierce Advocate for our Movement; and fought tirelessly to ensure a highly functioning; fiscally responsible; and financially successful RNC. He will be a wonderful Chairman! Also; Republicans also have a tremendous Candidate to become the next Treasurer of the RNC. Her name is Jennifer Saul-Rich; and she has served; with distinction; as the National Committeewoman from New York. Jennifer will work to ensure the RNC continues smashing every Fundraising Record; building an incredible “War Chest” for 2026; and beyond. She will be a FANTASTIC Treasurer! Joe Gruters and Jennifer Saul-Rich are 100% America First; and I know they will do an incredible job; and secure Great Success for Republicans all across our Country. Joe and Jennifer have my Complete and Total Endorsement — THEY WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN!
0,Great news for North Carolina! Michael Whatley; one of the most capable executives in our Country; who successfully ran; along with Lara Trump; the Republican National Committee; has launched his run for the United States Senate! Michael is fantastic at everything he does; and was certainly a STAR as Co-Chair of the RNC where; in the Presidential Election; we won every Swing State; the Popular Vote; and the Electoral College by a landslide. He also helped us win North Carolina six times; including Primaries; in 2016; 2020; and 2024! Michael is a wonderful man; has ALWAYS delivered for North Carolina; especially after the terrible floods; where the Biden Administration did nothing; and will continue doing so as your next U.S. Senator; where he will fight tirelessly to Grow our Economy; Cut Taxes and Regulations; Promote MADE IN THE U.S.A.; Champion American Energy DOMINANCE; Help Secure our already Secure Southern Border; Stop Migrant Crime; Murderers; and other Criminals from illegally entering our Country; Strengthen our Military/Veterans; and Protect our always under siege Second Amendment. Michael Whatley has my Complete and Total Endorsement – HE WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN!

The complexities of a Deal with Mexico are somewhat different than other Nations because of both the problems; and assets; of the Border. We have agreed to extend; for a 90 Day period; the exact same Deal as we had for the last short period of time; namely; that Mexico will continue to pay a 25% Fentanyl Tariff; 25% Tariff on Cars; and 50% Tariff on Steel; Aluminum; and Copper. Additionally; Mexico has agreed to immediately terminate its Non Tariff Trade Barriers; of which there were many. We will be talking to Mexico over the next 90 Days with the goal of signing a Trade Deal somewhere within the 90 Day period of time; or longer. Present at the meeting were Vice President JD Vance; Secretary of Treasury Scott Bessent; Secretary of State Marco Rubio; Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick; United States Trade Representative and Ambassador Jamieson Greer; Chief of Staff Susie Wiles; and Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy; and United States Homeland Security Advisor; Stephen Miller.

This sum will be announced within the next two weeks when the President of South Korea; Lee Jae Myung; comes to the White House for a Bilateral Meeting. I would also like to congratulate the new President on his Electoral Success. It is also agreed that South Korea will be completely OPEN TO TRADE with the United States; and that they will accept American product including Cars and Trucks; Agriculture; etc. We have agreed to a Tariff for South Korea of 15%. America will not be charged a Tariff. I would like to thank the Trade Representatives who came forward today. It was an Honor to meet them; and talk about the Great Success of their Country!
0,Why would one “Republican;” Senator Josh Hawley from the Great State of Missouri; join with all of the Democrats to block a Review; sponsored by Senator Rick Scott; and with the support of almost all other Republicans; of Nancy Pelosi’s Stock Trading over the last 25 years. The information was inappropriately released just minutes before the Vote — Very much like SABOTAGE! The Democrats; because of our tremendous ACHIEVEMENTS and SUCCESS; have been trying to “Target” me for a long period of time; and they’re using Josh Hawley; who I got elected TWICE; as a pawn to help them. I wonder why Hawley would pass a Bill that Nancy Pelosi is in absolute love with — He is playing right into the dirty hands of the Democrats. It’s a great Bill for her; and her “husband;” but so bad for our Country! I don’t think real Republicans want to see their President; who has had unprecedented success; TARGETED; because of the “whims” of a second-tier Senator named Josh Hawley!
0,We are very busy in the White House today working on Trade Deals. I have spoken to the Leaders of many Countries; all of whom want to make the United States “extremely happy.” I will be meeting with the South Korean Trade Delegation this afternoon. South Korea is right now at a 25% Tariff; but they have an offer to buy down those Tariffs. I will be interested in hearing what that offer is.We have just concluded a Deal with the Country of Pakistan; whereby Pakistan and the United States will work together on developing their massive Oil Reserves. We are in the process of choosing the Oil Company that will lead this Partnership. Who knows; maybe they’ll be selling Oil to India some day!Likewise; other Countries are making offers for a Tariff reduction. All of this will help reduce our Trade Deficit in a very major way. A full report will be released at the appropriate time. Thank you for your attention to this matter. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

0,WE HAVE A MASSIVE TRADE DEFICIT WITH INDIA!!!
0,Remember; while India is our friend; we have; over the years; done relatively little business with them because their Tariffs are far too high; among the highest in the World; and they have the most strenuous and obnoxious non-monetary Trade Barriers of any Country. Also; they have always bought a vast majority of their military equipment from Russia; and are Russia’s largest buyer of ENERGY; along with China; at a time when everyone wants Russia to STOP THE KILLING IN UKRAINE — ALL THINGS NOT GOOD! INDIA WILL THEREFORE BE PAYING A TARIFF OF 25%; PLUS A PENALTY FOR THE ABOVE; STARTING ON AUGUST FIRST. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER. MAGA!
0,AUGUST FIRST; A GREAT DAY FOR AMERICA!!!
0,THE AUGUST FIRST DEADLINE IS THE AUGUST FIRST DEADLINE — IT STANDS STRONG; AND WILL NOT BE EXTENDED. A BIG DAY FOR AMERICA!!!

0,Chuck Grassley; who I got re-elected to the U.S. Senate when he was down; by a lot; in the Great State of Iowa; could solve the “Blue Slip” problem we are having with respect to the appointment of Highly Qualified Judges and U.S. Attorneys; with a mere flick of the pen. Democrats like Schumer; Warner; Kaine; Booker; Schiff; and others; SLEAZEBAGS ALL; have an ironclad stoppage of Great Republican Candidates. Put simply; the President of the United States will never be permitted to appoint the person of his choice because of an ancient; and probably Unconstitutional; “CUSTOM;” that if you have; even one person in the opposite Party serving in the U.S. Senate; he/she must give consent; thereby completely stopping the opposite Party’s Nomination. The only way to beat this Hoax is to appoint a Democrat or; a weak and ineffective Republican. Therefore; I would never be able to appoint Great Judges or U.S. Attorneys in California; New York; New Jersey; Illinois; Virginia; and other places; where there is; coincidentally; the highest level of crime and corruption — The places where fantastic people are most needed! Senator Grassley must step up; like Crooked Joe Biden did; when he openly broke; at least two times; the “Blue Slip” SCAM; and like others have done over the years; and let our Great Republican Judges and U.S. Attorneys BE CONFIRMED. He should do this; IMMEDIATELY; and not let the Democrats laugh at him and the Republican Party for being weak and ineffective. The Democrats have broken this ridiculous custom on us; it’s time that we break it on them. Chuck; I know you have the Courage to do this; DO IT!
0,Everybody is saying that I was solely responsible for the firing of Stephen Colbert from CBS; Late Night. That is not true! The reason he was fired was a pure lack of TALENT; and the fact that this deficiency was costing CBS $50 Million Dollars a year in losses — And it was only going to get WORSE! Next up will be an even less talented Jimmy Kimmel; and then; a weak; and very insecure; Jimmy Fallon. The only real question is; who will go first? Show Biz and Television is a very simple business. If you get Ratings; you can say or do anything. If you don’t; you always become a victim. Colbert became a victim to himself; the other two will follow.

These ridiculous fees were incorrectly stated in the books and records. YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO PAY FOR AN ENDORSEMENT. IT IS TOTALLY ILLEGAL TO DO SO.

0,I just had a very good call with the Prime Minister of Cambodia; and informed him of my discussions with Thailand; and its Acting Prime Minister. Both Parties are looking for an immediate Ceasefire and Peace. They are also looking to get back to the “Trading Table” with the United States; which we think is inappropriate to do until such time as the fighting STOPS. They have agreed to immediately meet and quickly work out a Ceasefire and; ultimately; PEACE! It was an Honor to deal with both Countries. They have a long and storied History and Culture. They will hopefully get along for many years to come. When all is done; and Peace is at hand; I look forward to concluding our Trading Agreements with both!
0,I have just spoken to the Acting Prime Minister of Thailand; and it was a very good conversation. Thailand; like Cambodia; wants to have an immediate Ceasefire; and PEACE. I am now going to relay that message back to the Prime Minister of Cambodia. After speaking to both Parties; Ceasefire; Peace; and Prosperity seems to be a natural. We will soon see!
0,Just spoke to the Prime Minister of Cambodia relative to stopping the War with Thailand. I am calling the Acting Prime Minister of Thailand; right now; to likewise request a Ceasefire; and END to the War; which is currently raging. We happen to be; by coincidence; currently dealing on Trade with both Countries; but do not want to make any Deal; with either Country; if they are fighting — And I have told them so! The call with Thailand is being made momentarily. The call with Cambodia has ended; but expect to call back regarding War stoppage and Ceasefire based on what Thailand has to say. I am trying to simplify a complex situation! Many people are being killed in this War; but it very much reminds me of the Conflict between Pakistan and India; which was brought to a successful halt.

0,To the Great People of North Carolina; one of the most capable executives in our Country successfully ran; along with Lara Trump; the Republican National Committee. He happens to live in your incredible State; which I love; and won; including Primaries; six times in a row! My relationship with you has been fantastic; and only enhanced by the job I did after January 20th; when I took over the flood drenched areas that were abandoned by Sleepy Joe Biden and your Governor; and; through the infusion of money and hard work; fixed the problem like nobody else has the ability to do. The one that energized that project; and so many more; was the Chairman of the RNC; Michael Whatley. I am sending this Statement out for a very good reason. Mike would make an unbelievable Senator from North Carolina. He is fantastic at everything he does; and he was certainly great at the RNC where; in the Presidential Election; we won every Swing State; the Popular Vote; and the Electoral College by a landslide! But I have a mission for my friends in North Carolina; and that is to get Michael Whatley to run for the U.S. Senate. He is STRONG on the Border; stopping Crime; supporting our Military/Veterans; cutting Taxes; and saving our always under siege Second Amendment. I need him in Washington; and I need him representing YOU! Fortunately; I have somebody who will do a wonderful job as the Chairman of the RNC. His name is; Joe Gruters; and he will have my Complete and Total Endorsement. So; should Michael Whatley run for the Senate; please let this notification represent my Complete and Total Endorsement. HE WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN!

0,It was a Great Honor to tour the Renovation (and some new Construction!) of the Federal Reserve Building with Chairman Jerome Powell; Senator Tim Scott; and others. It’s got a long way to go; would have been much better if it were never started; but it is what it is and; hopefully; it will be finished ASAP. The cost overruns are substantial but; on the positive side; our Country is doing very well and can afford just about anything — Even the cost of this building! I’ll be watching and; hopefully; adding some expertise. As everyone knows; I renovated the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue; and it was a roaring SUCCESS. The total Construction cost was a small fraction of the Fed Building’s cost; and it is many times the size. With all of that being said; let’s just get it finished and; even more importantly; LOWER INTEREST RATES!

Columbia has also committed to ending their ridiculous DEI policies; admitting students based ONLY on MERIT; and protecting the Civil Liberties of their students on campus. Numerous other Higher Education Institutions that have hurt so many; and been so unfair and unjust; and have wrongly spent federal money; much of it from our government; are upcoming. It’s a great honor to have been involved; and I want to thank and congratulate Secretary Linda McMahon; and all those who worked with us on this important deal. I also want to thank and commend Columbia University for agreeing to do what is right. I look forward to watching them have a great future in our Country; maybe greater than ever before!

Families are being hurt because Interest Rates are too high; and even our Country is having to pay a higher Rate than it should be because of “Too Late.” Our Rate should be three points lower than they are; saving us $1 Trillion per year (as a Country). This stubborn guy at the Fed just doesn’t get it — Never did; and never will. The Board should act; but they don’t have the Courage to do so!

0,RT: https://truthsocial.com/users/realDonaldTrump/statuses/114899417740854572I just signed the largest TRADE DEAL in history with Japan. We worked on it long and hard—It’s a great deal for everybody…
0,We just completed a massive Deal with Japan; perhaps the largest Deal ever made. Japan will invest; at my direction; $550 Billion Dollars into the United States; which will receive 90% of the Profits. This Deal will create Hundreds of Thousands of Jobs — There has never been anything like it. Perhaps most importantly; Japan will open their Country to Trade including Cars and Trucks; Rice and certain other Agricultural Products; and other things. Japan will pay Reciprocal Tariffs to the United States of 15%. This is a very exciting time for the United States of America; and especially for the fact that we will continue to always have a great relationship with the Country of Japan. Thank you for your attention to this matter!

This Deal is a HUGE WIN for our Automakers; Tech Companies; Workers; Farmers; Ranchers; and Manufacturers. Thank you for your attention to this matter. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

0,The Harvard case was just tried in Massachusetts before an Obama appointed Judge. She is a TOTAL DISASTER; which I say even before hearing her Ruling. She has systematically taken over the various Harvard cases; and is an automatic “loss” for the People of our Country! Harvard has $52 Billion Dollars sitting in the Bank; and yet they are anti-Semitic; anti-Christian; and anti-America. Much of this money comes from the U.S.A.; all to the detriment of other Schools; Colleges; and Institutions; and we are not going to allow this unfair situation to happen any longer. How did this Trump-hating Judge get these cases? When she rules against us; we will IMMEDIATELY appeal; and WIN. Also; the Government will stop the practice of giving many Billions of Dollars to Harvard; much of which had been given without explanation. It is a longtime commitment to Fairness in Funding Education; and the Trump Administration will not stop until there is VICTORY. Thank you for your attention to this matter!

There are no explanations; there is no NOTHING. People were shocked that he was able to plea bargain; but the Judge should make him explain what happened. Thank you for your attention to this matter!

I may put a restriction on them that if they don’t change the name back to the original “Washington Redskins;” and get rid of the ridiculous moniker; “Washington Commanders;” I won’t make a deal for them to build a Stadium in Washington. The Team would be much more valuable; and the Deal would be more exciting for everyone. Cleveland should do the same with the Cleveland Indians. The Owner of the Cleveland Baseball Team; Matt Dolan; who is very political; has lost three Elections in a row because of that ridiculous name change. What he doesn’t understand is that if he changed the name back to the Cleveland Indians; he might actually win an Election. Indians are being treated very unfairly. MAKE INDIANS GREAT AGAIN (MIGA)!

0,The Wall Street Journal; and Rupert Murdoch; personally; were warned directly by President Donald J. Trump that the supposed letter they printed by President Trump to Epstein was a FAKE and; if they print it; they will be sued. Mr. Murdoch stated that he would take care of it but; obviously; did not have the power to do so. The Editor of The Wall Street Journal; Emma Tucker; was told directly by Karoline Leavitt; and by President Trump; that the letter was a FAKE; but Emma Tucker didn’t want to hear that. Instead; they are going with a false; malicious; and defamatory story anyway. President Trump will be suing The Wall Street Journal; NewsCorp; and Mr. Murdoch; shortly. The Press has to learn to be truthful; and not rely on sources that probably don’t even exist. President Trump has already beaten George Stephanopoulos/ABC; 60 Minutes/CBS; and others; and looks forward to suing and holding accountable the once great Wall Street Journal. It has truly turned out to be a “Disgusting and Filthy Rag” and; writing defamatory lies like this; shows their desperation to remain relevant. If there were any truth at all on the Epstein Hoax; as it pertains to President Trump; this information would have been revealed by Comey; Brennan; Crooked Hillary; and other Radical Left Lunatics years ago. It certainly would not have sat in a file waiting for “TRUMP” to have won three Elections. This is yet another example of FAKE NEWS!

0,Americans know we need a better Healthcare System to properly serve our Great Communities that were abandoned by the Radical Left Democrats. That is why Republicans included $50 Billion Dollars in the “ONE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL” — to strengthen our most vulnerable Hospitals; including those in Rural areas. BUT; EVERY DEMOCRAT VOTED AGAINST THIS FUNDING! I want to thank all of the Republicans in Congress who worked incredibly hard to make this achievement possible. OUR NATION THANKS YOU; TOO!
0,To the Law abiding; Tax paying; Hardworking Citizens of the United States of America; I am thrilled to announce that I have officially freed you from funding California’s disastrously overpriced; “HIGH SPEED TRAIN TO NOWHERE.” This boondoggle; led by the incompetent Governor of California; Gavin Newscum; has cost Taxpayers Hundreds of Billions of Dollars; and we have received NOTHING in return except Cost Overruns. The Railroad we were promised still does not exist; and never will. This project was Severely Overpriced; Overregulated; and NEVER DELIVERED. Thanks to Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy; not a SINGLE penny in Federal Dollars will go towards this Newscum SCAM ever again. This was an ill-conceived and unnecessary project; and a total waste of Taxpayer money — But no more!

0,The Radical Left Democrats have hit pay dirt; again! Just like with the FAKE and fully discredited Steele Dossier; the lying 51 “Intelligence” Agents; the Laptop from Hell; which the Dems swore had come from Russia (No; it came from Hunter Biden’s bathroom!); and even the Russia; Russia; Russia Scam itself; a totally fake and made up story used in order to hide Crooked Hillary Clinton’s big loss in the 2016 Presidential Election; these Scams and Hoaxes are all the Democrats are good at - It’s all they have - They are no good at governing; no good at policy; and no good at picking winning candidates. Also; unlike Republicans; they stick together like glue. Their new SCAM is what we will forever call the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax; and my PAST supporters have bought into this “bullshit;” hook; line; and sinker. They haven’t learned their lesson; and probably never will; even after being conned by the Lunatic Left for 8 long years. I have had more success in 6 months than perhaps any President in our Country’s history; and all these people want to talk about; with strong prodding by the Fake News and the success starved Dems; is the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax. Let these weaklings continue forward and do the Democrats work; don’t even think about talking of our incredible and unprecedented success; because I don’t want their support anymore! Thank you for your attention to this matter. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

0,This morning I finalized an important Deal with the Republic of Indonesia after speaking with their Highly Respected President Prabowo Subianto. This landmark Deal opens up Indonesia’s ENTIRE MARKET to the United States for the first time in History. As part of the Agreement; Indonesia has committed to purchasing $15 Billion Dollars in U.S. Energy; $4.5 Billion Dollars in American Agricultural Products; and 50 Boeing Jets; many of them 777’s. For the first time ever; our Ranchers; Farmers; and Fishermen will have Complete and Total Access to the Indonesian Market of over 280 million people. In addition; Indonesia will pay the United States a 19% Tariff on all Goods they export to us; while U.S. Exports to Indonesia are to be Tariff and Non Tariff Barrier FREE. If there is any Transshipment from a higher Tariff Country; then that Tariff will be added on to the Tariff that Indonesia is paying. Thank you to the People of Indonesia for your friendship and commitment to balancing our Trade Deficit. We will keep DELIVERING for the American People; and the People of Indonesia!

0,I have always suspected Shifty Adam Schiff was a scam artist. And now I learn that Fannie Mae’s Financial Crimes Division have concluded that Adam Schiff has engaged in a sustained pattern of possible Mortgage Fraud. Adam Schiff said that his primary residence was in MARYLAND to get a cheaper mortgage and rip off America; when he must LIVE in CALIFORNIA because he was a Congressman from CALIFORNIA. I always knew Adam Schiff was a Crook. The FRAUD began with the refinance of his Maryland property on February 6; 2009; and continued through multiple transactions until the Maryland property was correctly designated as a second home on October 13; 2020. Mortgage Fraud is very serious; and CROOKED Adam Schiff (now a Senator) needs to be brought to justice.

We’re on one Team; MAGA; and I don’t like what’s happening. We have a PERFECT Administration; THE TALK OF THE WORLD; and “selfish people” are trying to hurt it; all over a guy who never dies; Jeffrey Epstein. For years; it’s Epstein; over and over again. Why are we giving publicity to Files written by Obama; Crooked Hillary; Comey; Brennan; and the Losers and Criminals of the Biden Administration; who conned the World with the Russia; Russia; Russia Hoax; 51 “Intelligence” Agents; “THE LAPTOP FROM HELL;” and more? They created the Epstein Files; just like they created the FAKE Hillary Clinton/Christopher Steele Dossier that they used on me; and now my so-called “friends” are playing right into their hands. Why didn’t these Radical Left Lunatics release the Epstein Files? If there was ANYTHING in there that could have hurt the MAGA Movement; why didn’t they use it? They haven’t even given up on the John F. Kennedy or Martin Luther King; Jr. Files. No matter how much success we have had; securing the Border; deporting Criminals; fixing the Economy; Energy Dominance; a Safer World where Iran will not have Nuclear Weapons; it’s never enough for some people. We are about to achieve more in 6 months than any other Administration has achieved in over 100 years; and we have so much more to do. We are saving our Country and; MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN; which will continue to be our complete PRIORITY. The Left is imploding! Kash Patel; and the FBI; must be focused on investigating Voter Fraud; Political Corruption; ActBlue; The Rigged and Stolen Election of 2020; and arresting Thugs and Criminals; instead of spending month after month looking at nothing but the same old; Radical Left inspired Documents on Jeffrey Epstein. LET PAM BONDI DO HER JOB — SHE’S GREAT! The 2020 Election was Rigged and Stolen; and they tried to do the same thing in 2024 — That’s what she is looking into as AG; and much more. One year ago our Country was DEAD; now it’s the “HOTTEST” Country anywhere in the World. Let’s keep it that way; and not waste Time and Energy on Jeffrey Epstein; somebody that nobody cares about.

The collaborators knew it was a lie; but they manipulated the Dossier and the CIA to peddle their fairy tale. Brennan and Comey manipulated the system; and the document itself. They abused their power. Comey lauched a case against Trump in violation of the FBI Regulations. He deceived the FISA Court with the Dossier to gain a Spy Warrant. John Brennan used that Dossier knowing it was GARBAGE; and he insisted it be put in the Intelligence Committee Assessment. He knew it was such a Phony Document and that if it could be put in the Intellegence Committee Assessment; it will elevate the credibility and that he could drive Trump from office. He told Congress that it wasn’t in the Assessment - WELL IT WAS! Can he be charged? YES HE CAN! They eroded confidence and trust in the American Government; particularly the FBI; CIA; and other agencies; single-handedly. THEY SET BACK AMERICA CONSIDERABLY. James Comey needs daily therapy. He is so obsessed with his hatred of Trump. It’s what drove the Russia Hoax. He; more than anybody else; drove the Witch Hunt; and he can never get over the fact that he failed; and got fired - And he hates that; as well. On his way out the door; he purloined FBI Documents and leaked them to the Media with the plan that this will trigger the Special Counsel and drive Trump from office. Bob Mueller was appointed; his long time mentor and friend. But in the end his scheme failed!” Wow; thank you Gregg; AMAZING REPORTING!

0,Brazil is doing a terrible thing on their treatment of former President Jair Bolsonaro. I have watched; as has the World; as they have done nothing but come after him; day after day; night after night; month after month; year after year! He is not guilty of anything; except having fought for THE PEOPLE. I have gotten to know Jair Bolsonaro; and he was a strong Leader; who truly loved his Country — Also; a very tough negotiator on TRADE. His Election was very close and now; he is leading in the Polls. This is nothing more; or less; than an attack on a Political Opponent — Something I know much about! It happened to me; times 10; and now our Country is the “HOTTEST” in the World! The Great People of Brazil will not stand for what they are doing to their former President. I’ll be watching the WITCH HUNT of Jair Bolsonaro; his family; and thousands of his supporters; very closely. The only Trial that should be happening is a Trial by the Voters of Brazil — It’s called an Election. LEAVE BOLSONARO ALONE!
0,Any Country aligning themselves with the Anti-American policies of BRICS; will be charged an ADDITIONAL 10% Tariff. There will be no exceptions to this policy. Thank you for your attention to this matter!

0,I am saddened to watch Elon Musk go completely “off the rails;” essentially becoming a TRAIN WRECK over the past five weeks. He even wants to start a Third Political Party; despite the fact that they have never succeeded in the United States - The System seems not designed for them. The one thing Third Parties are good for is the creation of Complete and Total DISRUPTION &amp; CHAOS; and we have enough of that with the Radical Left Democrats; who have lost their confidence and their minds! Republicans; on the other hand; are a smooth running “machine;” that just passed the biggest Bill of its kind in the History of our Country. It is a Great Bill but; unfortunately for Elon; it eliminates the ridiculous Electric Vehicle (EV) Mandate; which would have forced everyone to buy an Electric Car in a short period of time. I have been strongly opposed to that from the very beginning. People are now allowed to buy whatever they want - Gasoline Powered; Hybrids (which are doing very well); or New Technologies as they come about - No more EV Mandate. I have campaigned on this for two years and; quite honestly; when Elon gave me his total and unquestioned Endorsement; I asked him whether or not he knew that I was going to terminate the EV Mandate - It was in every speech I made; and in every conversation I had. He said he had no problems with that - I was very surprised! Additionally; Elon asked that one of his close friends run NASA and; while I thought his friend was very good; I was surprised to learn that he was a blue blooded Democrat; who had never contributed to a Republican before. Elon probably was; also. I also thought it inappropriate that a very close friend of Elon; who was in the Space Business; run NASA; when NASA is such a big part of Elon’s corporate life. My Number One charge is to protect the American Public!
0,I just signed a Major Disaster Declaration for Kerr County; Texas; to ensure that our Brave First Responders immediately have the resources they need. These families are enduring an unimaginable tragedy; with many lives lost; and many still missing. The Trump Administration continues to work closely with State and Local Leaders. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem was on the ground yesterday with Governor Greg Abbott; who is working hard to help the people of his Great State. Our incredible U.S. Coast Guard; together with State First Responders; have saved more than 850 lives. GOD BLESS THE FAMILIES; AND GOD BLESS TEXAS!

0,This July 4th weekend I want to give a big “THANK YOU!” to the Heroic ICE Officers fighting every day to reclaim our Sovereignty and Freedom. One of the most exciting parts of the “ONE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL ACT” is that it includes ALL of the Funding and Resources that ICE needs to carry out the Largest Mass Deportation Operation in History. Our Brave ICE Officers; who are under daily violent assault; will finally have the tools and support that they need. We will not let America become a Third World Country filled with Crime; failing Schools; collapsing Hospitals; and total Social Dysfunction. It’s called “REMIGRATION” and; it will; MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
0,The Trump Administration is working with State and Local Officials on the ground in Texas in response to the tragic flooding that took place yesterday. Our Secretary of Homeland Security; Kristi Noem; will be there shortly. Melania and I are praying for all of the families impacted by this horrible tragedy. Our Brave First Responders are on site doing what they do best. GOD BLESS THE FAMILIES; AND GOD BLESS TEXAS!

0,Rep. Jamie Raskin; a third rate Democrat politician; has no idea what is in our fantastic Tax Cut Bill; nor would he understand it if he did. This DOPE  has  been consistently losing to me for YEARS; and I love watching his ugly face as he is forced to consistently concede DEFEAT TO TRUMP — And tonight should be another of those nights.

0,CONGRATULATIONS AMERICA! The June Border Statistics are in and; once again; they are the LOWEST RECORDED NUMBERS IN UNITED STATES HISTORY. The U.S. Border Patrol reported ZERO releases of Illegal Aliens into the Country. In addition; Customs and Border Protection only had 25;243 “Nationwide Encounters” throughout the entire month; which is absolutely STAGGERING; considering the Biden Administration was “encountering” tens of thousands of people every single DAY. America’s Borders are Safe and Secure; and the entire World knows it. All we need to do is keep it this way; which is exactly why Republicans need to pass “THE ONE; BIG; BEAUTIFUL BILL.” We still have Radical Left Judges trying to open the Border; and defy the Supreme Court; which is why Republicans must be smart; strong; and never let these Crazed Judges turn us into a Third World Country. The Men and Women of Border Patrol; ICE; and CBP are doing an amazing job but; they need more help and; they are counting on Republicans to; GET IT DONE!

0,Congressman Jason Smith: “We are gonna get the One; Big; Beautiful Bill passed and to your desk! This will be for the people who don't have lobbyists in this town. The farmers; the welders; the waitresses; the nurses pulling double shifts; the truck drivers hauling goods across this country - the folks who work hard; play by the rules; and ask for nothing more than a fair shot and a government that works for them; not against them. The One Big Beautiful Bill is their bill! It's about restoring sanity in a town that's lost it. It cuts the waste. It reins in the reckless spending. It demands that if you're able to work; you should. It delivers the largest tax cut in history; And it stops asking working families to foot the bill for Washington's bad decisions. Thanks for your vision; leadership and determination! You are my favorite President! Let’s get this done.”

0,It is my Great Honor to announce that I have just made a Trade Deal with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam after speaking with To Lam; the Highly Respected General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam. It will be a Great Deal of Cooperation between our two Countries. The Terms are that Vietnam will pay the United States a 20% Tariff on any and all goods sent into our Territory; and a 40% Tariff on any Transshipping. In return; Vietnam will do something that they have never done before; give the United States of America TOTAL ACCESS to their Markets for Trade. In other words; they will “OPEN THEIR MARKET TO THE UNITED STATES;” meaning that; we will be able to sell our product into Vietnam at ZERO Tariff. It is my opinion that the SUV or; as it is sometimes referred to; Large Engine Vehicle; which does so well in the United States; will be a wonderful addition to the various product lines within Vietnam. Dealing with General Secretary To Lam; which I did personally; was an absolute pleasure. Thank you for your attention to this matter!

0,Nobody wants to talk about GROWTH; which will be the primary reason that the Big; Beautiful Bill will be one of the most successful pieces of legislation ever passed. THIS GROWTH has already begun at levels never seen before. Trillions of Dollars are now being invested into the USA; more than ever before. Likewise; hundreds of Billions of Dollars in Tariffs are filling up the coffers of Treasury. The Tariff money has already arrived and is setting new records! We are growing our way out of the Sleepy Joe Biden MESS that he and the Democrats left us; and it is happening much faster than anyone thought possible. Our Country will make a fortune this year; more than any of our competitors; but only if the Big; Beautiful Bill is PASSED! As they say; Trump’s been right about everything; and this is the easiest of them all to predict. Republicans; don’t let the Radical Left Democrats push you around. We’ve got all the cards; and we are going to use them. Last year America was a “DEAD” Nation; with no hope for the future; and now it’s the “HOTTEST NATION IN THE WORLD!” MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

0,Almost all of our Great Republicans in the United States Senate have passed our “ONE; BIG; BEAUTIFUL BILL.” It is no longer a “House Bill” or a “Senate Bill”. It is everyone’s Bill. There is so much to be proud of; and EVERYONE got a major Policy WIN — But; the Biggest Winner of them all will be the American People; who will have Permanently Lower Taxes; Higher Wages and Take Home Pay; Secure Borders; and a Stronger and More Powerful Military. Additionally; Medicaid; Medicare; and Social Security Benefits are not being cut; but are being STRENGTHENED and PROTECTED from the Radical and Destructive Democrats by eliminating Waste; Fraud; and Abuse from those Programs.We can have all of this right now; but only if the House GOP UNITES; ignores its occasional “GRANDSTANDERS” (You know who you are!); and does the right thing; which is sending this Bill to my desk. We are on schedule — Let’s keep it going; and be done before you and your family go on a July 4thvacation. The American People need and deserve it. They sent us here to; GET IT DONE!Our Country is going to explode with Massive Growth; even more than it already has since I was Re-Elected. Between the Growth; this Bill; our Tariffs; and more; “THE ONE; BIG; BEAUTIFUL BILL” sets the United States down a fiscal path by greatly reducing our Federal Deficit; and setting us on course for enormous Prosperity in the new and wonderful Golden Age of America.To my GOP friends in the House: Stay UNITED; have fun; and Vote “YAY.” GOD BLESS YOU ALL!

0,Jerome “Too Late” Powell; and his entire Board; should be ashamed of themselves for allowing this to happen to the United States. They have one of the easiest; yet most prestigious; jobs in America; and they have FAILED — And continue to do so. If they were doing their job properly; our Country would be saving Trillions of Dollars in Interest Cost. The Board just sits there and watches; so they are equally to blame. We should be paying 1% Interest; or better!
0,Not that it really matters; but a terribly untalented writer for badly failing Forbes Magazine; Dan Alexander; who probably can’t get a meaningful job in the business; has written so inaccurately about me that it is ridiculous. Many others also; the media is mostly Fake News; but Forbes doesn’t even try to get things right. I haven’t spoken to these SleazeBags in years; they don’t want the facts; and they’re so inaccurate (purposely!) about everything. I would have thought Forbes would be DEAD by now; but it continues to hang around like a bad disease. Isn’t it owned by a hostile nation? Anyway; that’s what happens when you have bad reporters with evil intentions. Eventually the publication dies. I’ve happily seen it over; and over; again!

They; along with all of the other Republican Patriots who voted for the Bill; are people who truly love our Country! As President of the USA; I am proud of them all; and look forward to working with them to GROW OUR ECONOMY; REDUCE WASTEFUL SPENDING; SECURE OUR BORDER; FIGHT FOR OUR MILITARY/VETS; ENSURE THAT OUR MEDICAID SYSTEM HELPS THOSE WHO TRULY NEED IT; PROTECT OUR SECOND AMENDMENT; AND SO MUCH MORE. GOD BLESS AMERICA &amp;; MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!
0,Did Rand Paul Vote “NO” again tonight? What’s wrong with this guy???  DJT
0,Republicans must remember that they are fighting against a very evil; corrupt and; in many ways; incompetent (Policywise!) group of people; who would rather see our Country “go down in flames” than do the right thing and; MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! The Democrats would LOVE to see the Biggest Tax Hike in History (68%!); No Border Spending (Open Borders!); and a weak; underfunded Military; so we wouldn’t be able to do things like we did just one week ago in Iran. We gave the Dems a Debt Extension because it was the right thing to do; but they won’t do it for us. The one thing they do have is an ability to stick together; and vote as one group (They don’t have GRANDSTANDERS!). They also have House and Senate Rules that give Great Power to their Leaders - Committee Chairmanships; etc. Republicans don’t have that; have never been able to get it; BUT THEY SHOULD! What we do have is wonderful people and phenomenal Policy; and that should win Elections every single time!
0,Numerous people have come forward wanting to run in the Primary against “Senator Thom” Tillis. I will be meeting with them over the coming weeks; looking for someone who will properly represent the Great People of North Carolina and; so importantly; the United States of America. Thank you for your attention to this matter!
0,Looks like Senator Thom Tillis; as usual; wants to tell the Nation that he’s giving them a 68% Tax Increase; as opposed to the Biggest Tax Cut in American History! At the same time; he is unable to understand the importance of a Debt Extension; which Republicans gave to the Democrats just prior to the November 5th Election; because of its significance; and how important it was for the future of the U.S.A. Sadly; the Democrat Politicians probably won’t reciprocate on a Debt Extension because they’re nasty people who actually hate our Country. Tillis is also willing to throw the very important Tobacco Industry in North Carolina; “out the window;” for reasons nobody seems to understand. He loves China made windmills that will cost a fortune; ruin the landscape; and produce the most expensive Energy on Earth. I can’t believe that the Great People of North Carolina; a State that I love and won all three times; and a State that I just brought back with money; blood; sweat; and tears; from the recent tragic floods; when Sleepy Joe Biden let them DROWN; right up until the end of that Administration; without doing anything — I was given an A+ Rating for the job we did in bringing it back; and Tillis; despite being a Republican; was MISSING IN ACTION — North Carolina will not allow one of their Senators to GRANDSTAND in order to get some publicity for himself; for a possible; but very difficult Re-Election. America wants Reduced Taxes; including NO TAX ON TIPS; NO TAX ON OVERTIME; AND NO TAX ON SOCIAL SECURITY; Interest Deductions on Cars; Border Security; a Strong Military; and a Bill which is GREAT for our Farmers; Manufacturers and; Employment; in general. Thom Tillis is making a BIG MISTAKE for America; and the Wonderful People of North Carolina!

0,It is terrible what they are doing in Israel to Bibi Netanyahu. He is a War Hero; and a Prime Minister who did a fabulous job working with the United States to bring Great Success in getting rid of the dangerous Nuclear threat in Iran. Importantly; he is right now in the process of negotiating a Deal with Hamas; which will include getting the Hostages back. How is it possible that the Prime Minister of Israel can be forced to sit in a Courtroom all day long; over NOTHING (Cigars; Bugs Bunny Doll; etc.). It is a POLITICAL WITCH HUNT; very similar to the Witch Hunt that I was forced to endure. This travesty of “Justice” will interfere with both Iran and Hamas negotiations. In other words; it is INSANITY doing what the out-of-control prosecutors are doing to Bibi Netanyahu. The United States of America spends Billions of Dollar a year; far more than on any other Nation; protecting and supporting Israel. We are not going to stand for this. We just had a Great Victory with Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu at the helm — And this greatly tarnishes our Victory. LET BIBI GO; HE’S GOT A BIG JOB TO DO!

0,RT @realDonaldTrumpWhy would the so-called “Supreme Leader;” Ayatollah Ali Khamenei; of the war torn Country of Iran; say so blatantly and foolishly that he won the War with Israel; when he knows his statement is a lie; it is not so. As a man of great faith; he is not supposed to lie. His Country was decimated; his three evil Nuclear Sites were OBLITERATED; and I knew EXACTLY where he was sheltered; and would not let Israel; or the U.S. Armed Forces; by far the Greatest and Most Powerful in the World; terminate his life. I SAVED HIM FROM A VERY UGLY AND IGNOMINIOUS DEATH; and he does not have to say; “THANK YOU; PRESIDENT TRUMP!” In fact; in the final act of the War; I demanded that Israel bring back a very large group of planes; which were heading directly to Tehran; looking for a big day; perhaps the final knockout! Tremendous damage would have ensued; and many Iranians would have been killed. It was going to be the biggest attack of the War; by far. During the last few days; I was working on the possible removal of sanctions; and other things; which would have given a much better chance to Iran at a full; fast; and complete recovery - The sanctions are BITING! But no; instead I get hit with a statement of anger; hatred; and disgust; and immediately dropped all work on sanction relief; and more. Iran has to get back into the World Order flow; or things will only get worse for them. They are always so angry; hostile; and unhappy; and look at what it has gotten them - A burned out; blown up Country; with no future; a decimated Military; a horrible Economy; and DEATH all around them.

0,FAKE NEWS CNN IS SO DISGUSTING AND INCOMPETENT. SOME OF THE DUMBEST ANCHORS IN THE BUSINESS!
0,BREAKING NEWS…I was shocked to hear that the State of Israel; which has just had one of its Greatest Moments in History; and is strongly led by Bibi Netanyahu; is continuing its ridiculous Witch Hunt against their Great War Time Prime Minister! Bibi and I just went through HELL together; fighting a very tough and brilliant longtime enemy of Israel; Iran; and Bibi could not have been better; sharper; or stronger in his LOVE for the incredible Holy Land. Anybody else would have suffered losses; embarrassment; and chaos! Bibi Netanyahu was a WARRIOR; like perhaps no other Warrior in the History of Israel; and the result was something that nobody thought was possible; a complete elimination of potentially one of the biggest and most powerful Nuclear Weapons anywhere in the World; and it was going to happen; SOON! We were fighting; literally; for the Survival of Israel; and there is nobody in Israel’s History that fought harder or more competently than Bibi Netanyahu. Despite all of this; I just learned that Bibi has been summoned to Court on Monday for the continuation of this long running; (He has been going through this “Horror Show” since May of 2020 – Unheard of! This is the first time a sitting Israeli Prime Minister has ever been on trial.); politically motivated case; “concerning cigars; a Bugs Bunny doll; and numerous other unfair charges” in order to do him great harm. Such a WITCH HUNT; for a man who has given so much; is unthinkable to me. He deserves much better than this; and so does the State of Israel. Bibi Netanyahu’s trial should be CANCELLED; IMMEDIATELY; or a Pardon given to a Great Hero; who has done so much for the State. Perhaps there is no one that I know who could have worked in better harmony with the President of the United States; ME; than Bibi Netanyahu. It was the United States of America that saved Israel; and now it is going to be the United States of America that saves Bibi Netanyahu. THIS TRAVESTY OF “JUSTICE” CAN NOT BE ALLOWED!

They felt terribly! Fortunately for them and; as usual; solely for the purpose of demeaning PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP; the Fake News (Times and CNN) lied and totally misrepresented the Facts; none of which they had (because it was too soon; there were no Facts out there yet!). The News Conference will prove both interesting and irrefutable. Enjoy!
0,I have an idea for the Democrats to bring them back into “play.” After years of being left out in the cold; including suffering one of the Greatest Losses in History; the 2024 Presidential Election; the Democrats should nominate Low IQ Candidate; Jasmine Crockett; for President; and AOC+3 should be; respectively; Vice President; and three High Level Members of the Cabinet – Added together with our future Communist Mayor of New York City; Zohran Mamdani; and our Country is really SCREWED!
0,It’s finally happened; the Democrats have crossed the line. Zohran Mamdani; a 100% Communist Lunatic; has just won the Dem Primary; and is on his way to becoming Mayor. We’ve had Radical Lefties before; but this is getting a little ridiculous. He looks TERRIBLE; his voice is grating; he’s not very smart; he’s got AOC+3; Dummies ALL; backing him; and even our Great Palestinian Senator; Cryin’ Chuck Schumer; is groveling over him.

0,Stupid AOC; Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez; one of the “dumbest” people in Congress; is now calling for my Impeachment; despite the fact that the Crooked and Corrupt Democrats have already done that twice before. The reason for her “rantings” is all of the Victories that the U.S.A. has had under the Trump Administration. The Democrats aren’t used to WINNING; and she can’t stand the concept of our Country being successful again. When we examine her Test Scores; we will find out that she is NOT qualified for office but; nevertheless; far more qualified than Crockett; who is a seriously Low IQ individual; or Ilhan Omar; who does nothing but complain about our Country; yet the Failed Country that she comes from doesn’t have a Government; is drenched in Crime and Poverty; and is rated one of the WORST in the World; if it’s even rated at all. How dare “The Mouse” tells us how to run the United States of America! We’re just now coming back from that Radical Left experiment with Sleepy Joe; Kamala; and “THE AUTOPEN;” in charge. What a disaster it was! AOC should be forced to take the Cognitive Test that I just completed at Walter Reed Medical Center; as part of my Physical. As the Doctor in charge said; “President Trump ACED it;” meaning; I got every answer right. Instead of her constant complaining; Alexandria should go back home to Queens; where I was also brought up; and straighten out her filthy; disgusting; crime ridden streets; in the District she “represents;” and which she never goes to anymore. She better start worrying about her own Primary; before she thinks about beating our Great Palestinian Senator; Cryin’ Chuck Schumer; whose career is definitely on very thin ice! She and her Democrat friends have just hit the Lowest Poll Numbers in Congressional History; so go ahead and try Impeaching me; again; MAKE MY DAY!
0,Third Rate Congressman Thomas Massie; of the Great Commonwealth of Kentucky; a phenomenal State that I won all three times (by a lot!); keeps talking about how he is going to protect the Constitution; but he is actually very bad for the Constitution; and will probably vote against “THE GREAT; BIG; BEAUTIFUL BILL;” that grants the Biggest Tax Cuts in History; secures our Southern Border from Criminal Invasion; funds the Golden Dome; our Great Military and Veterans; protects our Second Amendment; grants NO TAX ON TIPS; NO TAX ON OVERTIME; and NO TAX ON SOCIAL SECURITY (for our Great Seniors!); and so much more. He is against all of the above; and many other incredible things. Why would anyone want to vote for a so-called “Congressman;” a RINO; at best; who wants to raise your Taxes by 68%; which is what will happen if; “THE GREAT; BIG; BEAUTIFUL BILL” doesn’t pass. He votes; “NO!” on everything; because he thinks it makes him cool; but he’s not cool; he’s a LOSER!

0,“Too Late” Jerome Powell; of the Fed; will be in Congress today in order to explain; among other things; why he is refusing to lower the Rate. Europe has had 10 cuts; we have had ZERO. No inflation; great economy - We should be at least two to three points lower. Would save the USA 800 Billion Dollars Per Year; plus. What a difference this would make. If things later change to the negative; increase the Rate. I hope Congress really works this very dumb; hardheaded person; over. We will be paying for his incompetence for many years to come. THE BOARD SHOULD ACTIVATE. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

0,Thanks to Tim Kennedy and Congressman Cory Mills for a great interview with Laura Ingraham!!!
0,CONGRATULATIONS TO EVERYONE! It has been fully agreed by and between Israel and Iran that there will be a Complete and Total CEASEFIRE (in approximately 6 hours from now; when Israel and Iran have wound down and completed their in progress; final missions!); for 12 hours; at which point the War will be considered; ENDED! Officially; Iran will start the CEASEFIRE and; upon the 12th Hour; Israel will start the CEASEFIRE and; upon the 24th Hour; an Official END to THE 12 DAY WAR will be saluted by the World. During each CEASEFIRE; the other side will remain PEACEFUL and RESPECTFUL. On the assumption that everything works as it should; which it will; I would like to congratulate both Countries; Israel and Iran; on having the Stamina; Courage; and Intelligence to end; what should be called; “THE 12 DAY WAR.” This is a War that could have gone on for years; and destroyed the entire Middle East; but it didn’t; and never will! God bless Israel; God bless Iran; God bless the Middle East; God bless the United States of America; and GOD BLESS THE WORLD!DONALD J. TRUMP;PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

0,I’d like to thank the Highly Respected Emir of Qatar for all that he has done in seeking Peace for the Region. Regarding the attack today at the American Base in Qatar; I am pleased to report that; in addition to no Americans being killed or wounded; very importantly; there have also been no Qataris killed or wounded. Thank you for your attention to this matter!
0,Iran has officially responded to our Obliteration of their Nuclear Facilities with a very weak response; which we expected; and have very effectively countered. There have been 14 missiles fired — 13 were knocked down; and 1 was “set free;” because it was headed in a nonthreatening direction. I am pleased to report that NO Americans were harmed; and hardly any damage was done. Most importantly; they’ve gotten it all out of their “system;” and there will; hopefully; be no further HATE. I want to thank Iran for giving us early notice; which made it possible for no lives to be lost; and nobody to be injured. Perhaps Iran can now proceed to Peace and Harmony in the Region; and I will enthusiastically encourage Israel to do the same. Thank you for your attention to this matter!DONALD J. TRUMP; PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
0,The sites that we hit in Iran were totally destroyed; and everyone knows it. Only the Fake News would say anything different in order to try and demean; as much as possible — And even they say they were “pretty well destroyed!” Working especially hard on this falsehood is Allison Cooper of Fake News CNN; Dumb Brian L. Roberts; Chairman of “Con”cast; Jonny Karl of ABC Fake News; and always; the Losers of; again; Concast’s NBC Fake News. It never ends with the sleazebags in the Media; and that’s why their Ratings are at an ALL TIME LOW — ZERO CREDIBILITY!
0,Did I hear Former President Medvedev; from Russia; casually throwing around the “N word” (Nuclear!); and saying that he and other Countries would supply Nuclear Warheads to Iran? Did he really say that or; is it just a figment of my imagination? If he did say that; and; if confirmed; please let me know; IMMEDIATELY. The “N word” should not be treated so casually. I guess that’s why Putin’s “THE BOSS.” By the way; if anyone thinks our “hardware” was great over the weekend; far and away the strongest and best equipment we have; 20 years advanced over the pack; is our Nuclear Submarines. They are the most powerful and lethal weapons ever built; and just launched the 30 Tomahawks — All 30 hit their mark perfectly. So; in addition to our Great Fighter Pilots; thank you to the Captain and Crew!
0,GET THIS “BUM” OUT OF OFFICE; ASAP!!!

0,Great interview; last night; of  Congressman August Pfluger - by Trey Gowdy. Very interesting and insightful!
0,Monumental Damage was done to all Nuclear sites in Iran; as shown by satellite images. Obliteration is an accurate term! The white structure shown is deeply imbedded into the rock; with even its roof well below ground level; and completely shielded from flame. The biggest damage took place far below ground level. Bullseye!!!

0,The damage to the Nuclear sites in Iran is said to be “monumental.” The hits were hard and accurate. Great skill was shown by our military. Thank you!
0,Congressman Thomas Massie of Kentucky is not MAGA; even though he likes to say he is. Actually; MAGA doesn’t want him; doesn’t know him; and doesn’t respect him. He is a negative force who almost always Votes “NO;” no matter how good something may be. He’s a simple minded “grandstander” who thinks it’s good politics for Iran to have the highest level Nuclear weapon; while at the same time yelling “DEATH TO AMERICA” at every chance they get. Iran has killed and maimed thousands of Americans; and even took over the American Embassy in Tehran under the Carter Administration. We had a spectacular military success yesterday; taking the “bomb” right out of their hands (and they would use it if they could!) but; as usual; and despite all of the praise and accolades received; this “lightweight” Congressman is against what was so brilliantly achieved last night in Iran. Massie is weak; ineffective; and votes “NO” on virtually everything put before him (Rand Paul; Jr.); no matter how good something may be. He is disrespectful to our great military; and all that they stand for; not even acknowledging their brilliance and bravery in yesterday’s attack; which was a total and complete WIN. Massie should drop his fake act and start putting America First; but he doesn’t know how to get there — he doesn’t have a clue! He’ll undoubtedly vote against the Great; Big; Beautiful Bill; even though non-passage means a 68% Tax Increase for everybody; and many things far worse than that. MAGA should drop this pathetic LOSER; Tom Massie; like the plague! The good news is that we will have a wonderful American Patriot running against him in the Republican Primary; and I’ll be out in Kentucky campaigning really hard. MAGA is not about lazy; grandstanding; nonproductive politicians; of which Thomas Massie is definitely one. Thank you to our incredible military for the AMAZING job they did last night. It was really SPECIAL!!! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.

0,We have completed our very successful attack on the three Nuclear sites in Iran; including Fordow; Natanz; and Esfahan. All planes are now outside of Iran air space. A full payload of BOMBS was dropped on the primary site; Fordow. All planes are safely on their way home. Congratulations to our great American Warriors.

0,I HATE “GREEN TAX CREDITS” IN THE GREAT; BIG; BEAUTIFUL BILL. They are largely a giant SCAM. I would much prefer that this money be used somewhere else; including reductions. “Anywhere” would be preferable! Windmills; and the rest of this “JUNK;” are the most expensive and inefficient energy in the world; is destroying the beauty of the environment; and is 10 times more costly than any other energy. None of it works without massive government subsidy (energy should NOT NEED SUBSIDY!). Also; it is almost exclusively made in China!!! It is time to break away; finally; from this craziness!!!

0,Why does Fox News allow failed TV personality Jessica Tarlov to “soil” The Five? Her voice; her manner; and above all else; what she says; are a disgrace to television broadcasting. I’ve had the best poll numbers that I’ve ever had; and she is constantly saying the exact opposite. The just out highly respected Rasmussen Poll is at 56%; Insider Advantage 54%; and many others are at 56% to 68%! Sadly; the audience has to listen to her spew off that I am doing poorly in the polls; while I am beating the democrats by 15%+ points and; more importantly; I just won an election against two candidates; Sleepy Joe and Kamala; in a Landslide by winning all 7 Swing States; and the Popular Vote by millions; with records broken everywhere! In all fairness to Jesse and Greg; who are terrific; they don’t see all of these poll numbers and can’t; therefore come to my defense. But I can! Nobody can stand Tarlov! She lies over and over again; and MAGA is complaining; BIG LEAGUE; that she’s all over Fox. Watch their ratings go down by keeping her on the show — nobody wants to listen to her. Why doesn’t she talk about the fact that I had ZERO illegal aliens come into our Country last month; whereas Sleepy Joe Biden allowed 62;000 people in; many from prisons; mental institutions; and gangs. People like Jessica Tarlov make MAGA absolutely hate Fox!
0,I am very happy to report that I have arranged; along with Secretary of State Marco Rubio; a wonderful Treaty between the Democratic Republic of the Congo; and the Republic of Rwanda; in their War; which was known for violent bloodshed and death; more so even than most other Wars; and has gone on for decades. Representatives from Rwanda and the Congo will be in Washington on Monday to sign Documents. This is a Great Day for Africa and; quite frankly; a Great Day for the World! I won’t get a Nobel Peace Prize for this; I won’t get a Nobel Peace Prize for stopping the War between India and Pakistan; I won’t get a Nobel Peace Prize for stopping the War between Serbia and Kosovo; I won’t get a Nobel Peace Prize for keeping Peace between Egypt and Ethiopia (A massive Ethiopian built dam; stupidly financed by the United States of America; substantially reduces the water flowing into The Nile River); and I won’t get a Nobel Peace Prize for doing the Abraham Accords in the Middle East which; if all goes well; will be loaded to the brim with additional Countries signing on; and will unify the Middle East for the first time in “The Ages!” No; I won’t get a Nobel Peace Prize no matter what I do; including Russia/Ukraine; and Israel/Iran; whatever those outcomes may be; but the people know; and that’s all that matters to me!
0,“Too Late” Powell complains about costs; much of which were produced by the Biden Fake “Government;” but he could do the biggest and best job for our Country by helping to lower Interest Rates and; if he reduced them to the number they should be; 1% to 2%; that “numbskull” would be saving the United States of America up to $1 Trillion Dollars per year. I fully understand that my strong criticism of him makes it more difficult for him to do what he should be doing; lowering Rates; but I’ve tried it all different ways. I’ve been nice; I’ve been neutral; and I’ve been nasty; and nice and neutral didn’t work! He’s a dumb guy; and an obvious Trump Hater; who should have never been there; I listened to someone that I shouldn’t have listened to; and Biden shouldn’t have reappointed him. We have virtually No Inflation; our Economy is doing really well; and will soon be doing; with the tremendous Tariff Income coming in; and Factories being built all over the Country; better than it has ever done before. If he was concerned about Inflation or anything else; then all he has to do is bring the Rate down; so we can benefit on Interest Costs; and raise it in the future when and if these “other elements” happen (which I doubt they will!).  Don’t say that you think there will be Inflation sometime in the future; because there isn’t now but; if there is; raise the Rates! We should be at the TOP of the attached List; not the bottom. I don’t know why the Board doesn’t override this Total and Complete Moron! Maybe; just maybe; I’ll have to change my mind about firing him? But regardless; his Term ends shortly!

0,We know exactly where the so-called “Supreme Leader” is hiding. He is an easy target; but is safe there - We are not going to take him out (kill!); at least not for now. But we don’t want missiles shot at civilians; or American soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin. Thank you for your attention to this matter!
0,We now have complete and total control of the skies over Iran. Iran had good sky trackers and other defensive equipment; and plenty of it; but it doesn’t compare to American made; conceived; and manufactured “stuff.”  Nobody does it better than the good ol’ USA.

0,Tom Homan: “I really; truly believe President Trump is doing the right thing for the American People…THE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL; we need the Senate to get off their butts; and pass this Bill. More money means we can do more — We can arrest more Public Safety threats; we can arrest more National Security threats; so Congress needs to pass that Bill; and give ICE and Border Patrol the tools and resources they need to GET THIS JOB DONE!”
0,Tom Homan: “When they double down; we triple down! So; the Men and Women of ICE are going to keep standing up; they’re going to keep doing the job. They’re working for the Greatest President in my Lifetime…His Success on the Border — We’ve got the Most Secure Border in the History of the Nation today. Criminal Threats; Illegal Alien Criminal Threats; arrested and deported; are at a Record High; much higher than Joe Biden!”

0,I have not reached out to Iran for “Peace Talks” in any way; shape; or form. This is just more HIGHLY FABRICATED; FAKE NEWS! If they want to talk; they know how to reach me. They should have taken the deal that was on the table - Would have saved a lot of lives!!!

0,Publicity seeking President Emmanuel Macron; of France; mistakenly said that I left the G7 Summit; in Canada; to go back to D.C. to work on a “cease fire” between Israel and Iran. Wrong! He has no idea why I am now on my way to Washington; but it certainly has nothing to do with a Cease Fire. Much bigger than that. Whether purposely or not; Emmanuel always gets it wrong. Stay Tuned!
0,If I didn’t put the National Guard into Los Angeles; the place would be burned down to the ground right now. I did incompetent Governor Gavin Newscum; who doesn’t have a clue; the favor of a lifetime. One of the WORST GOVERNORS IN HISTORY!
0,AMERICA FIRST means many GREAT things; including the fact that; IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!

0,Iran should have signed the “deal” I told them to sign. What a shame; and waste of human life. Simply stated; IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON. I said it over and over again! Everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran!
0,Congressman Abe Hamadeh is an America First Patriot who is doing a fantastic job representing Arizona’s 8th Congressional District! A Brave U.S. Army Veteran; and former Criminal Prosecutor; Abe is fighting tirelessly to Secure our now VERY Secure (Record Setting!)

0,Our Nation’s ICE Officers have shown incredible strength; determination; and courage as they facilitate a very important mission; the largest Mass Deportation Operation of Illegal Aliens in History. Every day; the Brave Men and Women of ICE are subjected to violence; harassment; and even threats from Radical Democrat Politicians; but nothing will stop us from executing our mission; and fulfilling our Mandate to the American People. ICE Officers are herewith ordered; by notice of this TRUTH; to do all in their power to achieve the very important goal of delivering the single largest Mass Deportation Program in History.In order to achieve this; we must expand efforts to detain and deport Illegal Aliens in America’s largest Cities; such as Los Angeles; Chicago; and New York; where Millions upon Millions of Illegal Aliens reside. These; and other such Cities; are the core of the Democrat Power Center; where they use Illegal Aliens to expand their Voter Base; cheat in Elections; and grow the Welfare State; robbing good paying Jobs and Benefits from Hardworking American Citizens. These Radical Left Democrats are sick of mind; hate our Country; and actually want to destroy our Inner Cities — And they are doing a good job of it! There is something wrong with them. That is why they believe in Open Borders; Transgender for Everybody; and Men playing in Women’s Sports — And that is why I want ICE; Border Patrol; and our Great and Patriotic Law Enforcement Officers; to FOCUS on our crime ridden and deadly Inner Cities; and those places where Sanctuary Cities play such a big role. You don’t hear about Sanctuary Cities in our Heartland!I want our Brave ICE Officers to know that REAL Americans are cheering you on every day. The American People want our Cities; Schools; and Communities to be SAFE and FREE from Illegal Alien Crime; Conflict; and Chaos. That’s why I have directed my entire Administration to put every resource possible behind this effort; and reverse the tide of Mass Destruction Migration that has turned once Idyllic Towns into scenes of Third World Dystopia. Our Federal Government will continue to be focused on the REMIGRATION of Aliens to the places from where they came; and preventing the admission of ANYONE who undermines the domestic tranquility of the United States.To ICE; FBI; DEA; ATF; the Patriots at Pentagon and the State Department; you have my unwavering support. Now go; GET THE JOB DONE! DJT
0,Iran and Israel should make a deal; and will make a deal; just like I got India and Pakistan to make; in that case by using TRADE with the United States to bring reason; cohesion; and sanity into the talks with two excellent leaders who were able to quickly make a decision and STOP!  Also; during my first term; Serbia and Kosovo were going at it hot and heavy; as they have for many decades; and this long time conflict was ready to break out into WAR. I stopped it (Biden has hurt the longer term prospects with some very stupid decisions; but I will fix it; again!). Another case is Egypt and Ethiopia; and their fight over a massive dam that is having an effect on the magnificent Nile River. There is peace; at least for now; because of my intervention; and it will stay that way! Likewise; we will have PEACE; soon; between Israel and Iran! Many calls and meetings now taking place. I do a lot; and never get credit for anything; but that’s OK; the PEOPLE understand. MAKE THE MIDDLE EAST GREAT AGAIN!
0,The U.S. had nothing to do with the attack on Iran; tonight. If we are attacked in any way; shape or form by Iran; the full strength and might of the U.S. Armed Forces will come down on you at levels never seen before. However; we can easily get a deal done between Iran and Israel; and end this bloody conflict!!!
0,What a GREAT Parade. THANK YOU; ARMY!

0,President Putin called this morning to very nicely wish me a Happy Birthday; but to more importantly; talk about Iran; a country he knows very well. We talked at length. Much less time was spent talking about Russia/Ukraine; but that will be for next week. He is doing the planned prisoner swaps - large numbers of prisoners are being exchanged; immediately; from both sides. The call lasted approximately 1 hour. He feels; as do I; this war in Israel-Iran should end; to which I explained; his war should also end.
0,I have been briefed on the terrible shooting that took place in Minnesota; which appears to be a targeted attack against State Lawmakers. Our Attorney General; Pam Bondi; and the FBI; are investigating the situation; and they will be prosecuting anyone involved to the fullest extent of the law. Such horrific violence will not be tolerated in the United States of America. God Bless the great people of Minnesota; a truly great place!
0,OUR GREAT MILITARY PARADE IS ON; RAIN OR SHINE. REMEMBER; A RAINY DAY PARADE BRINGS GOOD LUCK. I’LL SEE YOU ALL IN D.C.

0,Two months ago I gave Iran a 60 day ultimatum to “make a deal.” They should have done it! Today is day 61. I told them what to do; but they just couldn’t get there. Now they have; perhaps; a second chance!
0,The Appeals Court ruled last night that I can use the National Guard to keep our cities; in this case Los Angeles; safe. If I didn’t send the Military into Los Angeles; that city would be burning to the ground right now. We saved L.A. Thank you for the Decision!!!
0,I gave Iran chance after chance to make a deal. I told them; in the strongest of words; to “just do it;” but no matter how hard they tried; no matter how close they got; they just couldn’t get it done. I told them it would be much worse than anything they know; anticipated; or were told; that the United States makes the best and most lethal military equipment anywhere in the World; BY FAR; and that Israel has a lot of it; with much more to come - And they know how to use it. Certain Iranian hardliner’s spoke bravely; but they didn’t know what was about to happen. They are all DEAD now; and it will only get worse! There has already been great death and destruction; but there is still time to make this slaughter; with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal; come to an end. Iran must make a deal; before there is nothing left; and save what was once known as the Iranian Empire. No more death; no more destruction; JUST DO IT; BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE. God Bless You All!
0,Incompetent Gavin Newscum should have been THANKING me for the job we did in Los Angeles; rather than making sad excuses for the poor job he has done. If it weren’t for me getting the National Guard into Los Angeles; it would be burning to the ground right now!
0,The Biden Administration and Governor Newscum flooded America with 21 Million Illegal Aliens; destroying Schools; Hospitals and Communities; and consuming untold Billions of Dollars in Free Welfare. All of them have to go home; as do countless other Illegals and Criminals; who will turn us into a bankrupt Third World Nation. America was invaded and occupied. I am reversing the Invasion. It’s called Remigration. Our courageous ICE Officers; who are daily being subjected to doxxing and murder threats; are HEROES. We will always have their back as they carry out this noble mission. America will be for Americans again!
0,Thank you to everyone for being so generous yesterday at The Kennedy Center. We raised over $10 Million Dollars for its Restoration; A RECORD. In addition; the Actors and Actresses in Les Mis were incredible! The Show could not be better; or more beautiful. It’s running for another three weeks!
0,We remain committed to a Diplomatic Resolution to the Iran Nuclear Issue! My entire Administration has been directed to negotiate with Iran. They could be a Great Country; but they first must completely give up hopes of obtaining a Nuclear Weapon. Thank you for your attention to this matter!
0,The House of Representatives is NOW voting on my Administration’s first “Rescissions” Bill. It will OFFICALLY “claw back” $9.4 BILLION DOLLARS in funding for wasteful Foreign Aid; used for Radical “DEI” and the Green New SCAM; and the “Corporation for Public Broadcasting;” which funds the highly biased NPR and PBS. For decades; Republicans have promised to cut NPR; but have never done it; until now. NPR and PBS are a Radical Left Disaster; and 1000% against the Republican Party! These Rescissions; along with “THE ONE; BIG; BEAUTIFUL BILL;” our highly successful Tariffs; Mass Deportations of Illegal Aliens; and our Strong Economy; will finally CUT the Deficit; and help balance our Budget. The Rescissions Bill is a NO BRAINER; and every single Republican in Congress should vote; “YES.” MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
0,Biden let 21 Million Unvetted; Illegal Aliens flood into the Country from some of the most dangerous and dysfunctional Nations on Earth — Many of them Rapists; Murderers; and Terrorists. This tsunami of Illegals has destroyed Americans' Public Schools; Hospitals; Parks; Community Resources; and Living Conditions. They have stolen American Jobs; consumed BILLIONS OF DOLLARS in Free Welfare; and turned once idyllic Communities; like Springfield; Ohio; into Third World Nightmares. I campaigned on; and received a Historic Mandate for; the largest Mass Deportation Program in American History. Polling shows overwhelming Public Support for getting the Illegals out; and that is exactly what we will do. As Commander-in-Chief; I will always protect and defend the Heroes of ICE and Border Patrol; whose work has already resulted in the Most Secure Border in American History. Anyone who assaults or attacks an ICE or Border Agent will do hard time in jail. Those who are here illegally should either self deport using the CBP Home App or; ICE will find you and remove you. Saving America is not negotiable!

0,Our great Farmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good; long time workers away from them; with those jobs being almost impossible to replace. In many cases the Criminals allowed into our Country by the VERY Stupid Biden Open Borders Policy are applying for those jobs. This is not good. We must protect our Farmers; but get the CRIMINALS OUT OF THE USA. Changes are coming!

0,Los Angeles was safe and sound for the last two nights. Our great National Guard; with a little help from the Marines; put the L.A. Police in a position to effectively do their job. They all worked well together; but without the Military; Los Angeles would be a crime scene like we haven’t seen in years. Governor Gaven NewScum had totally lost control of the situation. He should be saying THANK YOU for saving his ass; instead of trying to justify his mistakes and incompetence!!!

0,For our adversaries; there is no greater fear than the United States Army. But for the American People; there is no greater pride—because YOU are the righteous sword of American Justice; and the ultimate shield of American Freedom!
0,From June 1775 to June 2025; those foolish enough to challenge America’s Army have been met with unyielding strength; unbreakable spirit; and unstoppable; overwhelming force. Time and again; our enemies have learned that if you dare to threaten the American People; the American Soldier will chase you down; crush you; and cast you into oblivion. The last sound you ever hear will be the chilling howl of Blackhawks in the dead of night; the thunderous boom of artillery fire; or the ferocious roar of a U.S. Army Infantry Brigade charging over the horizon.

0,“If they spit; we will hit.” This is a statement from the President of the United States concerning the catastrophic Gavin Newscum inspired Riots going on in Los Angeles. The Insurrectionists have a tendency to spit in the face of the National Guardsmen/women; and others. These Patriots are told to accept this; it’s just the way life runs. But not in the Trump Administration. IF THEY SPIT; WE WILL HIT; and I promise you they will be hit harder than they have ever been hit before. Such disrespect will not be tolerated!

0,We made a great decision in sending the National Guard to deal with the violent; instigated riots in California. If we had not done so; Los Angeles would have been completely obliterated. The very incompetent “Governor;”  Gavin Newscum; and “Mayor;” Karen Bass; should be saying; “THANK YOU; PRESIDENT TRUMP; YOU ARE SO WONDERFUL. WE WOULD BE NOTHING WITHOUT YOU; SIR.” Instead; they choose to lie to the People of California and America by saying that we weren’t needed; and that these are “peaceful protests.” Just one look at the pictures and videos of the Violence and Destruction tells you all you have to know. We will always do what is needed to keep our Citizens SAFE; so we can; together; MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
0,ARREST THE PEOPLE IN FACE MASKS; NOW!
0,Looking really bad in L.A. BRING IN THE TROOPS!!!
0,Jim McDonnell; the highly respected LAPD Chief; just stated that the protesters are getting very much more aggressive; and that he would “have to reassess the situation;” as it pertains to bringing in the troops. He should; RIGHT NOW!!! Don’t let these thugs get away with this. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!
0,Paid Insurrectionists!
0,Governor Gavin Newscum and “Mayor” Bass should apologize to the people of Los Angeles for the absolutely horrible job that they have done; and this now includes the ongoing L.A. riots. These are not protesters; they are troublemakers and insurrectionists. Remember; NO MASKS!
0,A once great American City; Los Angeles; has been invaded and occupied by Illegal Aliens and Criminals.  Now violent; insurrectionist mobs are swarming and attacking our Federal Agents to try and stop our deportation operations — But these lawless riots only strengthen our resolve. I am directing Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem; Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth; and Attorney General Pam Bondi; in coordination with all other relevant Departments and Agencies; to take all such action necessary to liberate Los Angeles from the Migrant Invasion; and put an end to these Migrant riots. Order will be restored; the Illegals will be expelled; and Los Angeles will be set free. Thank you for your attention to this matter!
0,Great job by the National Guard in Los Angeles after two days of violence; clashes and unrest. We have an incompetent Governor (Newscum) and Mayor (Bass) who were; as usual (just look at how they handled the fires; and now their VERY SLOW PERMITTING disaster. Federal permitting is complete!); unable to to handle the task. These Radical Left protests; by instigators and often paid troublemakers; will NOT BE TOLERATED. Also; from now on; MASKS WILL NOT BE ALLOWED to be worn at protests. What do these people have to hide; and why??? Again; thank you to the National Guard for a job well done!
0,If Governor Gavin Newscum; of California; and Mayor Karen Bass; of Los Angeles; can’t do their jobs; which everyone knows they can’t; then the Federal Government will step in and solve the problem; RIOTS &amp; LOOTERS; the way it should be solved!!!

0,I am pleased to announce that Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent; Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick; and United States Trade Representative; Ambassador Jamieson Greer; will be meeting in London on Monday; June 9; 2025; with Representatives of China; with reference to the Trade Deal. The meeting should go very well. Thank you for your attention to this matter!
0,Just inspected the site of the new Ballroom that will be built; compliments of a man known as Donald J. Trump; at the White House. For 150 years; Presidents; and many others; have wanted a beautiful Ballroom; but it never got built because nobody previously had any knowledge or experience in doing such things — But I do; like maybe nobody else; and it will go up quickly; and be a wonderful addition; very much in keeping with the magnificent White House itself. These are the “fun” projects I do while thinking about the World Economy; the United States; China; Russia; and lots of other Countries; places; and events. It will all be good; maybe even GREAT; depending on who is the President of the U.S.A.!
0,Congratulations to Chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce; Science; and Transportation; Ted Cruz; Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee; Roger Wicker; and Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference; Tom Cotton; for their amazing deal on Spectrum as posted last night. This is serious power for American Leadership on 6G. We will have the World’s Greatest Networks; and ensure the Highest Level of National Security for future Generations of Americans. Biden did nothing on Spectrum in four years but; thanks to “THE GREAT BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL;” my Administration will beat all expectations; and show the World the path forward!
0,GREAT JOB NUMBERS; STOCK MARKET UP BIG! AT THE SAME TIME; BILLIONS POURING IN FROM TARIFFS!!!
0,If “Too Late” at the Fed would CUT; we would greatly reduce interest rates; long and short; on debt that is coming due. Biden went mostly short term. There is virtually no inflation (anymore); but if it should come back; RAISE “RATE” TO COUNTER. Very Simple!!! He is costing our Country a fortune. Borrowing costs should be MUCH LOWER!!!
0,“Too Late” at the Fed is a disaster! Europe has had 10 rate cuts; we have had none. Despite him; our Country is doing great. Go for a full point; Rocket Fuel!

0,The Failing New York Times and the Washington ComPost; two “papers” that have ruthlessly fought me for years; have each done Polls where a vast majority of those sampled are Democrats. In other words; the Polls; just like their writings; are RIGGED - It is not possible for a Republican to do well in such a Poll! They are “corrupt as hell.” The real Polls out there have me doing better than ever before; JUST LIKE ELECTION DAY; 2024; where I WON seven out of seven Swing States; the Popular Vote; and Districts by 2;750 to 505. I won the Election in a landslide! The Fake News Media is Failing Our Nation at levels never seen before. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

0,I don’t mind Elon turning against me; but he should have done so months ago. This is one of the Greatest Bills ever presented to Congress. It’s a Record Cut in Expenses; $1.6 Trillion Dollars; and the Biggest Tax Cut ever given. If this Bill doesn’t pass; there will be a 68% Tax Increase; and things far worse than that. I didn’t create this mess; I’m just here to FIX IT. This puts our Country on a Path of Greatness. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
0,The easiest way to save money in our Budget; Billions and Billions of Dollars; is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn’t do it!

0,Shockingly; the Democrat controlled CBO just announced that the Tariffs will be reducing the Deficit by at least $2.8 Trillion Dollars. Too bad this information couldn’t have been released earlier; it would have kept people from knowingly saying untruths.
0,I just concluded a very good phone call with President Xi; of China; discussing some of the intricacies of our recently made; and agreed to; Trade Deal. The call lasted approximately one and a half hours; and resulted in a very positive conclusion for both Countries. There should no longer be any questions respecting the complexity of Rare Earth products. Our respective teams will be meeting shortly at a location to be determined. We will be represented by Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent; Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick; and United States Trade Representative; Ambassador Jamieson Greer. During the conversation; President Xi graciously invited the First Lady and me to visit China; and I reciprocated. As Presidents of two Great Nations; this is something that we both look forward to doing. The conversation was focused almost entirely on TRADE. Nothing was discussed concerning Russia/Ukraine; or Iran. We will inform the Media as to scheduling and location of the soon to be meeting. Thank you for your attention to this matter!

0,I just finished speaking; by telephone; with President Vladimir Putin; of Russia. The call lasted approximately one hour and 15 minutes. We discussed the attack on Russia’s docked airplanes; by Ukraine; and also various other attacks that have been taking place by both sides. It was a good conversation; but not a conversation that will lead to immediate Peace. President Putin did say; and very strongly; that he will have to respond to the recent attack on the airfields. We also discussed Iran; and the fact that time is running out on Iran’s decision pertaining to nuclear weapons; which must be made quickly! I stated to President Putin that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon and; on this; I believe that we were in agreement. President Putin suggested that he will participate in the discussions with Iran and that he could; perhaps; be helpful in getting this brought to a rapid conclusion. It is my opinion that Iran has been slowwalking their decision on this very important matter; and we will need a definitive answer in a very short period of time!
0,I am very pleased to announce that; after all of these years; I agree with Senator Elizabeth Warren on SOMETHING. The Debt Limit should be entirely scrapped to prevent an Economic catastrophe. It is too devastating to be put in the hands of political people that may want to use it despite the horrendous effect it could have on our Country and; indirectly; even the World. As to Senator Warren’s second statement on the $4 Trillion Dollars; I like that also; but it would have to be done over a period of time; as short as possible. Let’s get together; Republican and Democrat; and DO THIS!

0,Michael Wolff; a Third Rate Reporter; who is laughed at even by the scoundrels of the Fake News; recently stated that the only reason I’m “beating up” on Harvard; is because I applied there; and didn’t get in. That story is totally FALSE; I never applied to Harvard. I graduated from the Wharton School of Finance at the University of Pennsylvania. He is upset because his book about me was a total “BOMB.” Nobody wanted it; because his “reporting” and reputation is so bad!
0,So many false statements are being made about “THE ONE; BIG; BEAUTIFUL BILL;” but what nobody understands is that it’s the single biggest Spending Cut in History; by far! But there will be NO CUTS to Social Security; Medicare; or Medicaid. In fact; they will be saved from the incompetence of the Democrats. The Democrats; who have totally lost their confidence and their way; are saying whatever comes to mind — Anything to win! They suffered the Greatest Humiliation in the History of Politics; and they’re desperate to get back on their game; but they won’t be able to do that because their Policies are so bad; in fact; they would lead to the Destruction of our Country; and almost did. The only “cutting” we will do is for Waste; Fraud; and Abuse; something that should have been done by the Incompetent; Radical Left Democrats for the last four years; but wasn’t.
0,Passing THE ONE; BIG; BEAUTIFUL BILL is a Historic Opportunity to turn our Country around after four disastrous years under Joe Biden. We will take a massive step to balancing our Budget by enacting the largest mandatory Spending Cut; EVER; and Americans will get to keep more of their money with the largest Tax Cut; EVER; and no longer taxing Tips; Overtime; or Social Security for Seniors — Something 80 Million Voters supported in November. It will unleash American Energy by expediting permitting for Energy; and refilling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. It will make American Air Travel GREAT AGAIN by purchasing the final Air Traffic Control System. We will secure our skies from our adversaries by building The Golden Dome; and secure our Border by building more of our Wall; and supercharging the deportation of the millions of Criminal Illegals Joe Biden allowed to walk right into our Country. It will kick millions of Illegals off Medicaid; and make sure SNAP is focused on Americans ONLY! It will also restore Choice and Affordability for Car purchases by REPEALING Biden’s EV Mandate; and all of the GREEN NEW SCAM Tax Credits and Spending. THE ONE; BIG; BEAUTIFUL BILL also protects our beautiful children by stopping funding for sick sex changes for minors. With the Senate coming back to Washington today; I call on all of my Republican friends in the Senate and House to work as fast as they can to get this Bill to MY DESK before the Fourth of JULY. Thank you for your attention to this matter!
0,Just had a great talk with our Military Leaders. It is the strongest Military we have ever had; including the fact that we are stockpiling weapons at a rate never seen before by our Country. Hopefully; however; we will never have to use them!
0,The AUTOPEN should have stopped Iran a long time ago from “enriching.” Under our potential Agreement — WE WILL NOT ALLOW ANY ENRICHMENT OF URANIUM!
0,Yesterday’s horrific attack in Boulder; Colorado; WILL NOT BE TOLERATED in the United States of America. He came in through Biden’s ridiculous Open Border Policy; which has hurt our Country so badly. He must go out under “TRUMP” Policy. Acts of Terrorism will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law. This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE; and deport Illegal; Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland. My heart goes out to the victims of this terrible tragedy; and the Great People of Boulder; Colorado!
0,If the Courts somehow rule against us on Tariffs; which is not expected; that would allow other Countries to hold our Nation hostage with their anti-American Tariffs that they would use against us. This would mean the Economic ruination of the United States of America!
0,With the help of Patriots like you; we're going to produce our own metal; unleash our own energy; secure our own future; build our Country; control our destiny and we are once again going to put Pennsylvania steel into the backbone of America like never before!

0,The Democrat inspired and “controlled” Congressional Budget Office (CBO) purposefully gave us an EXTREMELY LOW level of Growth; 1.8% over 10 years. How ridiculous and unpatriotic is that! They did the same thing to us in 2017; and we DOUBLED their numbers. The information they recently released is even more absurd and indefensible. I predict we will do 3; 4; or even 5 times the amount they purposefully “allotted” to us (1.8%) and; with just our minimum expected 3% Growth; we will more than offset our Tax Cuts (which will; in actuality; cost us no money!).

The very high Tariffs I set made it virtually impossible for China to TRADE into the United States marketplace which is; by far; number one in the World. We went; in effect; COLD TURKEY with China; and it was devastating for them. Many factories closed and there was; to put it mildly; “civil unrest.” I saw what was happening and didn’t like it; for them; not for us. I made a FAST DEAL with China in order to save them from what I thought was going to be a very bad situation; and I didn’t want to see that happen. Because of this deal; everything quickly stabilized and China got back to business as usual. Everybody was happy! That is the good news!!! The bad news is that China; perhaps not surprisingly to some; HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US. So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!

0,The U.S. Court of International Trade incredibly ruled against the United States of America on desperately needed Tariffs but; fortunately; the full 11 Judge Panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit Court has just stayed the order by the Manhattan-based Court of International Trade. Where do these initial three Judges come from? How is it possible for them to have potentially done such damage to the United States of America? Is it purely a hatred of “TRUMP?” What other reason could it be? I was new to Washington; and it was suggested that I use The Federalist Society as a recommending source on Judges. I did so; openly and freely; but then realized that they were under the thumb of a real “sleazebag” named Leonard Leo; a bad person who; in his own way; probably hates America; and obviously has his own separate ambitions. He openly brags how he controls Judges; and even Justices of the United States Supreme Court — I hope that is not so; and don’t believe it is! In any event; Leo left The Federalist Society to do his own “thing.” I am so disappointed in The Federalist Society because of the bad advice they gave me on numerous Judicial Nominations. This is something that cannot be forgotten! With all of that being said; I am very proud of many of our picks; but very disappointed in others. They always must do what’s right for the Country! In this case; it is only because of my successful use of Tariffs that many Trillions of Dollars have already begun pouring into the U.S.A. from other Countries; money that; without these Tariffs; we would not be able to get. It is the difference between having a rich; prosperous; and successful United States of America; and quite the opposite. The ruling by the U.S. Court of International Trade is so wrong; and so political! Hopefully; the Supreme Court will reverse this horrible; Country threatening decision; QUICKLY and DECISIVELY. Backroom “hustlers” must not be allowed to destroy our Nation! The horrific decision stated that I would have to get the approval of Congress for these Tariffs. In other words; hundreds of politicians would sit around D.C. for weeks; and even months; trying to come to a conclusion as to what to charge other Countries that are treating us unfairly. If allowed to stand; this would completely destroy Presidential Power — The Presidency would never be the same! This decision is being hailed all over the World by every Country; other than the United States of America. Radical Left Judges; together with some very bad people; are destroying America. Under this decision; Trillions of Dollars would be lost by our Country; money that will; MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. It would be the harshest financial ruling ever leveled on us as a Sovereign Nation. The President of the United States must be allowed to protect America against those that are doing it Economic and Financial harm. Thank you for your attention to this matter!

Kyle will uphold the Rule of Law in the Great State of Florida; where men do not play in Women’s Sports; Illegals Criminals are found and deported; and Tough on Crime Policies are championed. Thank you Kyle!
0,It is my great honor to nominate Emil Bove to serve as a Judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. Emil is a distinguished graduate of Georgetown Law; and served as Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York for nearly a decade; where he was the Co-Chief of the Terrorism and International Narcotics Unit. Emil is SMART; TOUGH; and respected by everyone. He will end the Weaponization of Justice; restore the Rule of Law; and do anything else that is necessary to; MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. Emil Bove will never let you down!

0,Our great Mortgage Agencies; Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac; provide a vital service to our Nation by helping hardworking Americans reach the American Dream — Home Ownership. I am working on TAKING THESE AMAZING COMPANIES PUBLIC; but I want to be clear; the U.S. Government will keep its implicit GUARANTEES; and I will stay strong in my position on overseeing them as President. These Agencies are now doing very well; and will help us to; MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
0,Other than the Rigged Presidential Election of 2020; the Biggest Scandal in American History is the “AUTOPEN!” Whoever used it was usurping the power of the Presidency; and it should be very easy to find out who that person (or persons) is. They did things that a Joe Biden; of sound mind; would have never done; like; Open Borders; Transgender for everyone; men in women’s sports; and far more. Fear not; however; we will bring America BACK; BIGGER; BETTER; AND STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE!
0,Nobody has done more for Alaska than your Favorite President; DONALD J. TRUMP. However; the Biden/Harris Administration terminated MUCH of our good; JOB producing product. I am working very hard to gain it all back (and actually; MUCH MORE!); but need the support of your Political Leaders to make this happen. Without their commitment; it won’t happen. With it; Alaska will become the Economic and Job producing MIRACLE of our Country!
0,As the wonderful people of the Great State of Maine know; I did something for them; in particular the Fishing Industry; which everyone said was virtually impossible to do; or get done. I approved FULL Fishing Rights in the Ocean Waters; directly off the Coast of Maine; that were viciously taken away from them by the Obama/Biden Administration. They were not allowed to fish in those waters; and it would take them more than a day to get into areas; less fertile; where they were allowed to fish. In the meantime; Canada fished; and did very well in these formerly unrestricted areas. Immediately upon Sleepy Joe taking Office; his “AUTOPEN” rejected the Deal that I made for the people of Maine; greatly hurting the Fishermen and women. They call it a restricted “Environmental Monument;” an Ode to the Environmentalists doing everything they can to destroy our Country. In actuality; it was a punishment to the State by Obama/Biden. Additionally; I have done much for the wonderful Lumberjacks; who voted for me in great numbers. In fact; I won Maine-2; BIG. In any event; and as the World knows; I ended up winning the Election of 2024 in a LANDSLIDE; and am now working diligently to bring these valuable Fishing Rights back to Maine. Unfortunately; I have certain obstacles that only your Political Leaders can tell you about!

0,I was extremely satisfied with the 50% Tariff allotment on the European Union; especially since they were “slow walking (to put it mildly!); our negotiations with them. Remember; I am empowered to “SET A DEAL” for Trade into the United States if we are unable to make a deal; or are treated unfairly. I have just been informed that the E.U. has called to quickly establish meeting dates. This is a positive event; and I hope that they will; FINALLY; like my same demand to China; open up the European Nations for Trade with the United States of America. They will BOTH be very happy; and successful; if they do!!!
0,California; under the leadership of Radical Left Democrat Gavin Newscum; continues to ILLEGALLY allow “MEN TO PLAY IN WOMEN’S SPORTS.” This week a transitioned Male athlete; at a major event; won “everything;” and is now qualified to compete in the “State Finals” next weekend. As a Male; he was a less than average competitor. As a Female; this transitioned person is practically unbeatable. THIS IS NOT FAIR; AND TOTALLY DEMEANING TO WOMEN AND GIRLS. Please be hereby advised that large scale Federal Funding will be held back; maybe permanently; if the Executive Order on this subject matter is not adhered to. The Governor; himself; said it is “UNFAIR.” I will speak to him today to find out which way he wants to go??? In the meantime I am ordering local authorities; if necessary; to not allow the transitioned person to compete in the State Finals. This is a totally ridiculous situation!!!
0,Sheriff Scott Jenkins; his wife Patricia; and their family have been dragged through HELL by a Corrupt and Weaponized Biden DOJ. In fact; during his trial; when Sheriff Jenkins tried to offer exculpatory evidence to support himself; the Biden Judge; Robert Ballou; refused to allow it; shut him down; and then went on a tirade. As we have seen; in Federal; City; and State Courts; Radical Left or Liberal Judges allow into evidence what they feel like; not what is mandated under the Constitution and Rules of Evidence. This Sheriff is a victim of an overzealous Biden Department of Justice; and doesn’t deserve to spend a single day in jail. He is a wonderful person; who was persecuted by the Radical Left “monsters;” and “left for dead.” This is why I; as President of the United States; see fit to end his unfair sentence; and grant Sheriff Jenkins a FULL and Unconditional Pardon. He will NOT be going to jail tomorrow; but instead will have a wonderful and productive life.

Harvard is very slow in the presentation of these documents; and probably for good reason! The best thing Harvard has going for it is that they have shopped around and found the absolute best Judge (for them!) - But have no fear; the Government will; in the end; WIN!

0,I’ve always had a very good relationship with Vladimir Putin of Russia; but something has happened to him. He has gone absolutely CRAZY! He is needlessly killing a lot of people; and I’m not just talking about soldiers. Missiles and drones are being shot into Cities in Ukraine; for no reason whatsoever. I’ve always said that he wants ALL of Ukraine; not just a piece of it; and maybe that’s proving to be right; but if he does; it will lead to the downfall of Russia! Likewise; President Zelenskyy is doing his Country no favors by talking the way he does. Everything out of his mouth causes problems; I don’t like it; and it better stop. This is a War that would never have started if I were President. This is Zelenskyy’s; Putin’s; and Biden’s War; not “Trump’s;” I am only helping to put out the big and ugly fires; that have been started through Gross Incompetence and Hatred.

Nobody told us that! We want to know who those foreign students are; a reasonable request since we give Harvard BILLIONS OF DOLLARS; but Harvard isn’t exactly forthcoming. We want those names and countries. Harvard has $52;000;000; use it; and stop asking for the Federal Government to continue GRANTING money to you!

For two and a half centuries; our brave soldiers have fought; bled; and died to keep us FREE; and now we will honor them with a wonderful Parade; one that is worthy of their service and sacrifice. Americans across the Nation are invited to attend. RSVP at https://america250.org/.
0,I am proud to announce that; after much consideration and negotiation; US Steel will REMAIN in America; and keep its Headquarters in the Great City of Pittsburgh. For many years; the name; “United States Steel” was synonymous with Greatness; and now; it will be again. This will be a planned partnership between United States Steel and Nippon Steel; which will create at least 70;000 jobs; and add $14 Billion Dollars to the U.S. Economy. The bulk of that Investment will occur in the next 14 months. This is the largest Investment in the History of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. My Tariff Policies will ensure that Steel will once again be; forever; MADE IN AMERICA. From Pennsylvania to Arkansas; and from Minnesota to Indiana; AMERICAN MADE is BACK. I will see you all at US Steel; in Pittsburgh; on Friday; May 30th; for a BIG Rally. CONGRATULATIONS TO ALL!
0,The European Union; which was formed for the primary purpose of taking advantage of the United States on TRADE; has been very difficult to deal with. Their powerful Trade Barriers; Vat Taxes; ridiculous Corporate Penalties; Non-Monetary Trade Barriers; Monetary Manipulations; unfair and unjustified lawsuits against Americans Companies; and more; have led to a Trade Deficit with the U.S. of more than $250;000;000 a year; a number which is totally unacceptable. Our discussions with them are going nowhere! Therefore; I am recommending a straight 50% Tariff on the European Union; starting on June 1; 2025. There is no Tariff if the product is built or manufactured in the United States. Thank you for your attention to this matter!
0,I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone’s that will be sold in the United  States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States; not India; or anyplace else.

0,Our negotiated deal with the United Kingdom is working out well for all. I strongly recommend to them; however; that in order to get their Energy Costs down; they stop with the costly and unsightly windmills; and incentivize modernized drilling in the North Sea; where large amounts of oil lay waiting to be taken. A century of drilling left; with Aberdeen as the hub. The old fashioned tax system disincentivizes drilling; rather than the opposite. U.K.’s Energy Costs would go WAY DOWN; and fast!

The Republican Party of Florida’s Voter Registration lead over Democrats is now over 1.25 Million – a New and Record Level of SUCCESS! Florida’s largest County; Miami-Dade; has FLIPPED RED to a Republican Majority in Voter Registration; and Republicans lead in a total of 59 out of 67 Counties across the State. “TRUMP” was the first Republican Presidential Candidate to win Miami-Dade since 1988. THANK YOU FLORIDA — MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
0,A Federal Judge in Boston; who knew absolutely nothing about the situation; or anything else; has ordered that EIGHT of the most violent criminals on Earth curtail their journey to South Sudan; and instead remain in Djibouti. He would not allow these monsters to proceed to their final destination. This is not the premise under which I was elected President; which was to PROTECT our Nation. The Judges are absolutely out of control; they’re hurting our Country; and they know nothing about particular situations; or what they are doing — And this must change; IMMEDIATELY! Hopefully; the Supreme Court of the United States will put an END to the quagmire that has been caused by the Radical Left. If this is not worked out quickly; and the World is watching; our Country will be under siege again; with hundreds of thousands of hardened criminals; “BREAKING DOWN THE WALLS.” We were also forced to leave behind; in order to watch these hardened thugs; a large number of ICE Officers; who would otherwise be in the United States; protecting our Citizens.
0,“THE ONE; BIG; BEAUTIFUL BILL” has PASSED the House of Representatives! This is arguably the most significant piece of Legislation that will ever be signed in the History of our Country!

Great job by Speaker Mike Johnson; and the House Leadership; and thank you to every Republican who voted YES on this Historic Bill! Now; it’s time for our friends in the United States Senate to get to work; and send this Bill to my desk AS SOON AS POSSIBLE! There is no time to waste. The Democrats have lost control of themselves; and are aimlessly wandering around; showing no confidence; grit; or determination. They have forgotten their landslide loss in the Presidential Election; and are warped in the past; hoping someday to revive Open Borders for the World’s criminals to be able to pour into our Country; men to be able to play in women’s sports; and transgender for everybody. They don’t realize that these things; and so many more like them; will NEVER AGAIN happen!

0,Joe Biden was not for Open Borders; he never talked about Open Borders; where criminals of all kinds; shapes; and sizes; can flow into our Country at will. It wasn’t his idea to Open the Border; and almost destroy our Country; and cost us Hundreds of Billions of Dollars to get criminals out of our Country; and go through the process we are going through now. It was the people that knew he was cognitively impaired; and that took over the Autopen. They stole the Presidency of the United States; and put us in Great Danger. This is TREASON at the Highest Level! They did it to destroy our Country. The Joe Biden that everybody knew would never allow drug dealers; gang members; and the mentally insane to come into our Country totally unchecked and unvetted. All anyone has to do is look up his record. Something very severe should happen to these Treasonous Thugs that wanted to destroy our Country; but couldn’t; because I came along.

0,Just completed my two hour call with President Vladimir Putin of Russia. I believe it went very well. Russia and Ukraine will immediately start negotiations toward a Ceasefire and; more importantly; an END to the War. The conditions for that will be negotiated between the two parties; as it can only be; because they know details of a negotiation that nobody else would be aware of. The tone and spirit of the conversation were excellent. If it wasn’t; I would say so now; rather than later. Russia wants to do largescale TRADE with the United States when this catastrophic “bloodbath” is over; and I agree. There is a tremendous opportunity for Russia to create massive amounts of jobs and wealth. Its potential is UNLIMITED. Likewise; Ukraine can be a great beneficiary on Trade; in the process of rebuilding its Country. Negotiations between Russia and Ukraine will begin immediately. I have so informed President Volodymyr Zelenskyy; of Ukraine; Ursula von der Leyen; President of the European Commission; President Emmanuel Macron; of France; Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni; of Italy; Chancellor Friedrich Merz; of Germany; and President Alexander Stubb; of Finland; during a call with me; immediately after the call with President Putin. The Vatican; as represented by the Pope; has stated that it would be very interested in hosting the negotiations. Let the process begin!

Candidates aren’t allowed to pay for ENDORSEMENTS; which is what Kamala did; under the guise of paying for entertainment. In addition; this was a very expensive and desperate effort to artificially build up her sparse crowds. IT’S NOT LEGAL!

THE SUBJECTS OF THE CALL WILL BE; STOPPING THE “BLOODBATH” THAT IS KILLING; ON AVERAGE; MORE THAN 5000 RUSSIAN AND UKRAINIAN SOLDIERS A WEEK; AND TRADE. I WILL THEN BE SPEAKING TO PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY OF UKRAINE AND THEN; WITH PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY; VARIOUS MEMBERS OF NATO. HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE A PRODUCTIVE DAY; A CEASEFIRE WILL TAKE PLACE; AND THIS VERY VIOLENT WAR; A WAR THAT SHOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED; WILL END. GOD BLESS US ALL!!!
0,Walmart should STOP trying to blame Tariffs as the reason for raising prices throughout the chain. Walmart made BILLIONS OF DOLLARS  last year; far more than expected. Between Walmart and China they should; as is said; “EAT THE TARIFFS;” and not charge valued customers ANYTHING. I’ll be watching; and so will your customers!!!
0,Whoever had control of the “AUTOPEN” is looking to be a bigger and bigger scandal by the moment. It is a major part of the real crime; THAT THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 2020 WAS RIGGED AND STOLEN! Millions and millions of people knew that; but the Radical Left Democrats waged a campaign of inoculation and innocence like none that had ever been waged before. THIS IS WHY THE UNSELECT COMMITTEE OF POLITICAL THUGS; WHO WERE GIVEN A FULL AND COMPLETE PARDON BY THE PERSON WHO WIELDED THE NOW ILLEGALLY USED AUTOPEN; DELETED AND DESTROYED ALL EVIDENCE AND INFORMATION FROM THEIR CORRUPT AND VICIOUS WITCH HUNT AGAINST ME; AND MANY OTHER PEOPLE; WHOSE LIVES WERE COMPLETELY SHATTERED AND DESTROYED BY THIS HISTORICALLY CRIMINAL EVENT. Remember; it all began with DIRTY COP James Comey; Obama; a hapless and cognitively impaired Sleepy Joe Biden; and my now very famous ACCUSATION that;“THEY SPIED ON MY CAMPAIGN!” Whoever had control of the  Autopen is just the beginning. The biggest crime of all is that THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WAS RIGGED! I (MAGA!) WON THE ELECTION BY MILLIONS OF VOTES; AND EVERYONE KNOWS IT. GOD BLESS AMERICA; FOR THE FIGHT HAS JUST BEGUN!!!

0,The Supreme Court has just ruled that the worst murderers; drug dealers; gang members; and even those who are mentally insane; who came into our Country illegally; are not allowed to be forced out without going through a long; protracted; and expensive Legal Process; one that will take; possibly; many years for each person; and one that will allow these people to commit many crimes before they even see the inside of a Courthouse. The result of this decision will let more CRIMINALS pour into our Country; doing great harm to our cherished American public. It will also encourage other criminals to illegally enter our Country; wreaking havoc and bedlam wherever they go. The Supreme Court of the United States is not allowing me to do what I was elected to do. Sleepy Joe Biden allowed MILLIONS of Criminal Aliens to come into our Country without any “PROCESS” but; in order to get them out of our Country; we have to go through a long and extended PROCESS. In any event; thank you to Justice Alito and Justice Thomas for attempting to protect our Country. This is a bad and dangerous day for America!

0,Republicans MUST UNITE behind; “THE ONE; BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL!” Not only does it cut Taxes for ALL Americans; but it will kick millions of Illegal Aliens off of Medicaid to PROTECT it for those who are the ones in real need. The Country will suffer greatly without this Legislation; with their Taxes going up 65%. It will be blamed on the Democrats; but that doesn’t help our Voters. We don’t need “GRANDSTANDERS” in the Republican Party. STOP TALKING; AND GET IT DONE! It is time to fix the MESS that Biden and the Democrats gave us. Thank you for your attention to this matter!
0,I see that Highly Overrated Bruce Springsteen goes to a Foreign Country to speak badly about the President of the United States. Never liked him; never liked his music; or his Radical Left Politics and; importantly; he’s not a talented guy — Just a pushy; obnoxious JERK; who fervently supported Crooked Joe Biden; a mentally incompetent FOOL; and our WORST EVER President; who came close to destroying our Country. If I wasn’t elected; it would have been GONE by now! Sleepy Joe didn’t have a clue as to what he was doing; but Springsteen is “dumb as a rock;” and couldn’t see what was going on; or could he (which is even worse!)? This dried out “prune” of a rocker (his skin is all atrophied!) ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT until he gets back into the Country; that’s just “standard fare.” Then we’ll all see how it goes for him!

The people are with us in bigger numbers than ever before. They want to; MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!
0,Remember; it all started right after the Civil War ended; it had nothing to do with current day Immigration Policy!
0,Big case today in the United States Supreme Court. Birthright Citizenship was not meant for people taking vacations to become permanent Citizens of the United States of America; and bringing their families with them; all the time laughing at the “SUCKERS” that we are! The United States of America is the only Country in the World that does this; for what reason; nobody knows — But the drug cartels love it! We are; for the sake of being politically correct; a STUPID Country but; in actuality; this is the exact opposite of being politically correct; and it is yet another point that leads to the dysfunction of America. Birthright Citizenship is about the babies of slaves. As conclusive proof; the Civil War ended in 1865; the Bill went to Congress less than a year later; in 1866; and was passed shortly after that. It had nothing to do with Illegal Immigration for people wanting to SCAM our Country; from all parts of the World; which they have done for many years. It had to do with Civil War results; and the babies of slaves who our politicians felt; correctly; needed protection. Please explain this to the Supreme Court of the United States. Again; remember; the Civil War ended in 1865; and the Bill goes to Congress in 1866 — We didn’t have people pouring into our Country from all over South America; and the rest of the World. It wasn’t even a subject. What we had were the BABIES OF SLAVES. Thank you for your attention to this matter. Good luck with this very important case. GOD BLESS THE U.S.A.!

Why should our military; and therefore our taxpayers; be forced to pay hundreds of millions of Dollars when they can get it for FREE from a  country that wants to reward us for a job well done.

Remember; these are men that truly strive to do what is RIGHT for America. The Democrats; on the other hand; want to DESTROY our Country. You must oppose these Democrat Amendments which; in all fairness to them; were made prior to my News Conference this morning announcing that Drug Prices; under our Most Favored Nations Policy; will be going down from 50% to 90%; affecting EVERYTHING that is done in a very positive way. When I return from the Middle East; where great things will happen for America; we will work together on any and all outstanding issues; but there shouldn’t be many — The Bill is GREAT.

0,For many years the World has wondered why Prescription Drugs and Pharmaceuticals in the United States States of America were SO MUCH HIGHER IN PRICE THAN THEY WERE IN ANY OTHER NATION; SOMETIMES BEING FIVE TO TEN TIMES MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE SAME DRUG; MANUFACTURED IN THE EXACT SAME LABORATORY OR PLANT; BY THE SAME COMPANY??? It was always difficult to explain and very embarrassing because; in fact; there was no correct or rightful answer. The Pharmaceutical/Drug Companies would say; for years; that it was Research and Development Costs; and that all of these costs were; and would be; for no reason whatsoever; borne by the “suckers” of America; ALONE. Campaign Contributions can do wonders; but not with me; and not with the Republican Party. We are going to do the right thing; something that the Democrats have fought for many years. Therefore; I am pleased to announce that Tomorrow morning; in the White House; at 9:00 A.M.; I will be signing one of the most consequential Executive Orders in our Country’s history. Prescription Drug and Pharmaceutical prices will be REDUCED; almost immediately; by 30% to 80%. They will rise throughout the World in order to equalize and; for the first time in many years; bring FAIRNESS TO AMERICA! I will be instituting a MOST FAVORED NATION’S POLICY whereby the United States will pay the same price as the Nation that pays the lowest price anywhere in the World. Our Country will finally be treated fairly; and our citizens Healthcare Costs will be reduced by numbers never even thought of before. Additionally; on top of everything else; the United States will save TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS. Thank you for your attention to this matter. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

0,I just watched an exhausted; highly neurotic Stephanie Ruhle spew LIES about Tariffs; as do many others; in order not to give me the Victory that they all see coming. Few people know Stephanie Ruhle; but I do; and she doesn’t have what it takes. Our Deal with the United Kingdom yesterday was AMAZING for both Countries and; in addition to everything else; British Airways just ordered $10 Billion Dollars worth of new Boeing planes. We’re going to make a fortune with Tariffs; only smart people understand that; and Stephanie was never known as a “High IQ” person. MSDNC has become the Voice of the Democrat Party; and they should be treated as a Political Advocate with all of the Taxes and Penalties therefrom. Their Ratings are terrible; but Brian Roberts and his crew should be forced to TELL THE TRUTH. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
0,I highly recommend Keith Poole; who is the very successful Editor-in-Chief of the New York Post; to take over the entire operation of the highly inaccurate; “China Centric;” Wall Street Journal. It’s an easy move for Rupert; and he’ll love the results. Such a change would be a GREAT DAY for America; but not a Great Day for China!
0,MSNBC; the worst there is on Television misrepresentation; is so far knowingly off in their statements about me and Tariffs that it should be considered a Major Campaign Violation. They are nothing less than an arm of the Democrat National Committee; and their untruths are incredible; real losers. Their ratings are down the tubes; but that pressure on them doesn’t give them the right to lie and cheat!
0,Costs down; NO INFLATION. Very different from what the Fed; and Fake News Media; were hoping for!
0,Many Trade Deals in the hopper; all good (GREAT!) ones!
0,The problem with even a “TINY” tax increase for the RICH; which I and all others would graciously accept in order to help the lower and middle income workers; is that the Radical Left Democrat Lunatics would go around screaming;“Read my lips;” the fabled Quote by George Bush the Elder that is said to have cost him the Election. NO; Ross Perot cost him the Election! In any event; Republicans should probably not do it; but I’m OK if they do!!!

0,Talks with Russia/Ukraine continue. The U.S. calls for; ideally; a 30-day unconditional ceasefire. Hopefully; an acceptable ceasefire will be observed; and both Countries will be held accountable for respecting the sanctity of these direct negotiations. If the ceasefire is not respected; the U.S. and its partners will impose further sanctions. Thousands of young soldiers are dying on a weekly basis; and everybody should want it to STOP. I do; and the United States of America does; also. As President; I will stay committed to securing Peace between Russia and Ukraine; together with the Europeans; and a Lasting Peace it will be! This ceasefire must ultimately build toward a Peace Agreement. It can all be done very quickly; and I will be available on a moment’s notice if my services are needed. Thank you for your attention to this matter!

0,Today is an incredible day for America as we deliver our first Fair; Open; and Reciprocal Trade Deal — Something our past Presidents never cared about. Together with our strong Ally; the United Kingdom; we have reached the first; historic Trade Deal since Liberation Day. As part of this Deal; America will raise $6 BILLION DOLLARS in External Revenue from 10% Tariffs; $5 BILLION DOLLARS in new Export Opportunities for our Great Ranchers; Farmers; and Producers; and enhance the National Security of both the U.S. and the UK through the creation of an Aluminum and Steel Trading Zone; and a secure Pharmaceutical Supply Chain. This Deal shows that if you respect America; and bring serious proposals to the table; America is OPEN FOR BUSINESS. Many more to come — STAY TUNED!

0,The Election Interfering 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris; which aired on CBS just before Election Day and deep into Early Voting; turned out to be much worse than expected; with her answers being unlawfully fixed; manipulated; and doctored throughout by CBS; in order to try and make Kamala appear at least somewhat coherent. The full transcript; which 60 Minutes; CBS; and Paramount tried to hide from the American People; and refused to release until after I was already Inaugurated; and they were ordered to do so by the Federal Communications Commission; shows that the “interview” was nothing but fake; corrupt; anti-Trump propaganda. On top of that; in a total slap in the face to anyone who believes in TRUTH and Honest Journalism; this Fake News Puff Piece has now been nominated for an award by the totally discredited Emmys. Did 60 Minutes and its Corporate Parents apply to get an Emmy for an illegally falsified interview; or did other Fake Outlets nominate them for this dubious “honor”? These antics are why the American People have no trust in the Press; and demand that the Media; very much including 60 Minutes; CBS; and its owners; be held responsible for their corruption and lies; which is exactly what we are doing in Court!

I very much want to work with him; but cannot understand one simple TRUTH — Why is America subsidizing Canada by $200 Billion Dollars a year; in addition to giving them FREE Military Protection; and many other things? We don’t need their Cars; we don’t need their Energy; we don’t need their Lumber; we don’t need ANYTHING they have; other than their friendship; which hopefully we will always maintain. They; on the other hand; need EVERYTHING from us! The Prime Minister will be arriving shortly and that will be; most likely; my only question of consequence.

This is a passion for Ed; more so than for almost anyone that I have seen. One of the reasons that I was so successful in winning the 2024 Presidential Election is my commitment to Health; and helping to Make America Healthy. The Cost of the Chronic Disease Epidemic has gotten out of control over the past four years of the Biden Presidency. We are going to take our Country BACK; and FAST. Ed Martin will be a big player in doing so and; I hope; that the Republican Senators will make a commitment to his approval; which is now before them.

When some day in the future you look back at your Vote for Ed Martin; you will be very proud of what you have done for America and America’s Health. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
0,Radical Left Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser ignores Illegals committing Violent Crimes like Rape and Murder in his State and; instead; jailed Tina Peters; a 69-year-old Gold Star mother who worked to expose and document Democrat Election Fraud. Tina is an innocent Political Prisoner being horribly and unjustly punished in the form of Cruel and Unusual Punishment. This is a Communist persecution by the Radical Left Democrats to cover up their Election crimes and misdeeds in 2020. The same Democrat Party that flies to El Salvador to try to free an MS-13 Terrorist; is cruelly imprisoning; perhaps for life; a grandmother whose brave and heroic son gave his life for America. Colorado must end this unjust incarceration of an innocent American. I am hereby directing the Department of Justice to take all necessary action to help secure the release of this “hostage” being held in a Colorado prison by the Democrats; for political reasons.

For too long; America has been plagued by vicious; violent; and repeat Criminal Offenders; the dregs of society; who will never contribute anything other than Misery and Suffering.

No longer will we tolerate these Serial Offenders who spread filth; bloodshed; and mayhem on our streets. That is why; today; I am directing the Bureau of Prisons; together with the Department of Justice; FBI; and Homeland Security; to reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt ALCATRAZ; to house America’s most ruthless and violent Offenders. We will no longer be held hostage to criminals; thugs; and Judges that are afraid to do their job and allow us to remove criminals; who came into our Country illegally.

0,The Democrats are really out of control. They have lost everything; especially their minds! These Radical Left Lunatics are into the “Impeachment thing” again. They have already got two “No Name;” little respected Congressmen; total Whackjobs both; throwing the “Impeachment” of DONALD J. TRUMP around; for about the 20th time; even though they have no idea for what I would be Impeached. Maybe it should be for cleaning up the MESS that they left us on the Border; or the Highest Inflation in our Country’s History or; perhaps; it should be the incompetent Withdrawal from Afghanistan; or Russia; Russia; Russia/Ukraine; Ukraine; Ukraine; or the Attack of Israel on October 7th that only proceeded because they allowed Iran to regain Great Wealth. These Congressmen stated that; they didn’t know why they would Impeach me but; “We just want to do it.” The Republicans should start to think about expelling them from Congress for all of the crimes that they have committed; especially around Election time(s). These are very dishonest people that won’t let our Country heal! Why do we allow them to continuously use Impeachment as a weapon against the President of the United States who; by all accounts; is working hard to SAVE OUR COUNTRY. It’s the same playbook that they used in my First Term; and Republicans are not going to allow them to get away with it again. These are total LOWLIFES; who hate our Country; and everything it stands for. Perhaps we should start playing this game on them; and expel Democrats for the many crimes that they have committed — And these are REAL crimes. Remember; “Shifty” Adam Schiff demanded a Pardon; and they had to use the power of the Auto Pen; and a Full Pardon; for him and the Unselect Committee of Political Thugs; to save them from Expulsion; and probably worse!

0,The case we have against 60 Minutes; CBS; and Paramount is a true WINNER. They cheated and defrauded the American People at levels never seen before in the Political Arena. Kamala Harris; during Early Voting and; immediately before Election Day; was asked a question; and gave an answer; that was so bad and incompetent that it would have cost her many of the Votes that she ended up getting. It was a disastrous answer! 60 Minutes and its corporate parents; in order that this not have a negative impact on her; removed and deleted Kamala’s entire answer; every word of it; and replaced it with a response that she gave later on to an entirely different question. The new answer was not good; but it didn’t show Gross Incompetence like the one that was removed by 60 Minutes. In other words; 60 Minutes perpetrated a Giant FRAUD against the American People; the Federal Elections Commission; and the Federal Communications System. Despite all of the above; and Paramount’s/CBS’/60 Minutes’ admittance to this crime and; with other similar corrupt removals of answers to questions; the Failing New York Times; which is Fake News both in writing and polling; claims that “people” said that the case is baseless. They don’t mean that; they just have a non curable case of TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME; possibly to the point where the Times’ interjection makes them liable for tortious interference; including in Elections; which we are intently studying. The bottom line is that what 60 Minutes and its corporate owners have committed is one of the most egregious illegalities in Broadcast History. Nothing like this; the illegal creation of an answer for a Presidential Candidate; has ever been done before; they have to pay a price for it; and the Times should also be on the hook for their likely unlawful behavior. It is vital to hold these Liars and Fraudsters accountable!

Liddle’ Peter Baker; the very biased and untalented writer for The Times; followed his Editor’s demands and wrote that Ukraine should get back territory; including; I suppose; Crimea; and other ridiculous requests; in order to stop the killing that is worse than anything since World War II. Why doesn’t this lightweight reporter say that it was Obama who made it possible for Russia to steal Crimea from Ukraine without even a shot being fired. It was also Liddle’ Peter who wrote an absolutely fawning; yet terribly  written Biography; on Obama. It was a JOKE! Did Baker ever criticize the Obama Crimea Giveaway? NO; not once; only TRUMP; and I’ve had nothing to do with this stupid war; other than early on; when I gave Ukraine Javelins; and Obama gave them sheets. This is Sleepy Joe Biden’s War; not mine. It was a loser from day one; and should have never happened; and wouldn’t have happened if I were President at the time. I’m just trying to clean up the mess that was left to me by Obama and Biden; and what a mess it is. With all of that being said; there was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas; cities and towns; over the last few days. It makes me think that maybe he doesn’t want to stop the war; he’s just tapping me along; and has to be dealt with differently; through “Banking” or “Secondary Sanctions?” Too many people are dying!!!

They are very close to a deal; and the two sides should now meet; at very high levels; to “finish it off.” Most of the major points are agreed to. Stop the bloodshed; NOW.

0,Charles Payne; of Fox; is truly fantastic at what he does. He understands Tariffs; and he understands Life but; most importantly; he has been supportive of “TRUMP” right from the beginning – and I’ll always be supportive of him. With that being said; go out and immediately buy his new book; whatever it may be; because anything he does is good. MAGA loves Charles Payne!

Jeffrey is bringing with him Michael Scherer and Ashley Parker; not exactly pro-Trump writers; either; to put it mildly! The story they are writing; they have told my representatives; will be entitled; “The Most Consequential President of this Century.” I am doing this interview out of curiosity; and as a competition with myself; just to see if it’s possible for The Atlantic to be “truthful.” Are they capable of writing a fair story on “TRUMP”? The way I look at it; what can be so bad – I WON!

Now; since our filings began; they act like they are all “American Apple Pie.” Harvard is a threat to Democracy; with a lawyer; who represents me; who should therefore be forced to resign; immediately; or be fired.

0,Ukrainian President; Volodymyr Zelenskyy; is boasting on the front page of The Wall Street Journal that; “Ukraine will not legally recognize the occupation of Crimea. There’s nothing to talk about here.” This statement is very harmful to the Peace Negotiations with Russia in that Crimea was lost years ago under the auspices of President Barack Hussein Obama; and is not even a point of discussion. Nobody is asking Zelenskyy to recognize Crimea as Russian Territory but; if he wants Crimea; why didn’t they fight for it eleven years ago when it was handed over to Russia without a shot being fired? The area also houses; for many years before “the Obama handover;” major Russian submarine bases. It’s inflammatory statements like Zelenskyy’s that makes it so difficult to settle this War. He has nothing to boast about! The situation for Ukraine is dire — He can have Peace or; he can fight for another three years before losing the whole Country. I have nothing to do with Russia; but have much to do with wanting to save; on average; five thousand Russian and Ukrainian soldiers a week; who are dying for no reason whatsoever. The statement made by Zelenskyy today will do nothing but prolong the “killing field;” and nobody wants that! We are very close to a Deal; but the man with “no cards to play” should now; finally; GET IT DONE. I look forward to being able to help Ukraine; and Russia; get out of this Complete and Total MESS; that would have never started if I were President!

She ruled against me in the past; in a shocking display of sick judicial temperament; on a case that ended up working out very well for me; on appeal. Her ruling was so pathologically bad that it became the “talk of the town.” I could have a 100% perfect case and she would angrily rule against me. It’s called Trump Derangement Syndrome; and she’s got a bad case of it. To put it nicely; Beryl Howell is an unmitigated train wreck.  NO JUSTICE!!!

The Courts are intimidated by the Radical Left who are; “playing the Ref.” Great Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito correctly wants to dissolve the pause on deportations. He is right on this! If we don’t get these criminals out of our Country; we are not going to have a Country any longer. We cannot give everyone a trial; because to do so would take; without exaggeration; 200 years. We would need hundreds of thousands of trials for the hundreds of thousands of Illegals we are sending out of the Country. Such a thing is not possible to do. What a ridiculous situation we are in.

Now; after five months and; even though Jay was previously confirmed by the Senate on a Bipartisan basis; and has complied with ALL requests of the Senate Judiciary Committee; Chuck Schumer has announced that he is blocking all New York U.S. Attorney Nominees.   The Southern District leads the Department of Justice’s oversight over our Financial Markets; and fights for the safety of Millions of New Yorkers and the over 60 Million people who visit New York annually. The Southern District needs strong leadership NOW; and I thank Jay for taking on this role while we continue to pursue his Senate confirmation.
0,Can you believe it? A Judge ruled against us on 530;000 Illegal Migrants (that Joe Biden flew over the Border in his program to transport Illegals into the Country by airplane) saying that they can’t be looked at as a group; but that each case has to be tried individually. Based on the Court System; that would take approximately 100 years. What is going on with our Courts? They are totally OUT OF CONTROL. They seem to hate “TRUMP” so much; that anything goes! We are trying to bring our Country back from the destruction caused by the Democrats and Crooked Joe Biden. I won on a Policy of Common Sense; and what Common Sense do we have when we have to have 530;000 trials? This Radicalized Judge is saying that Sleepy Joe Biden can fly more than half a million Illegals into America; IN ONE DAY; but we have to hold many years of long and tedious trials to fly each and every one of them back home. Where is the JUSTICE here???

These two Radical Left fools left behind two cities that will take years to recover from their incompetence and evil. Harvard has been hiring almost all woke; Radical Left; idiots and “birdbrains” who are only capable of teaching FAILURE to students and so-called “future leaders.” Look just to the recent past at their plagiarizing President; who so greatly embarrassed Harvard before the United States States Congress. When it got so bad that they just couldn’t take it anymore; they moved this grossly inept woman into another position; teaching; rather than firing her ON THE SPOT. Since then much else has been found out about her; but she remains in place.

0,Wow! Fake News MSNBC has REALLY BAD RATINGS; in fact; not much better than the broken broadcasting disaster known as CNN. Comcast; which also has the ailing network known as NBC; is trying to stay away from lawsuits by disassociating NBC from MSNBC; but it won’t work. Comcast; the owner of both; and it’s Chairman; Brian Roberts; are a disgrace to the integrity of Broadcasting!!!

0,Our farmers are GREAT; but because of their GREATNESS; they are always put on the Front Line with our adversaries; such as China; whenever there is a Trade negotiation or; in this case; a Trade War. The same thing happened in my First Term. China was brutal to our Farmers; I these Patriots to just hold on; and a great trade deal was made. I rewarded our farmers with a payment of $28 Billion Dollars; all through the China deal. It was a great transaction for the USA; until Crooked Joe Biden came in and didn’t enforce it. China largely reneged on the deal (although they behaved during the Trump Administration); only buying a portion of what they agreed to buy. They had ZERO respect for the Crooked Biden Administration; and who can blame them for that? Interestingly; they just reneged on the big Boeing deal; saying that they will “not take possession” of fully committed to aircraft. The USA will PROTECT OUR FARMERS!!!

0,Moments ago; the Illegal Criminal; who was allowed into our Country by Crooked Joe Biden; was convicted of the heinous murder of Rachel Morin. Rachel was a beautiful mother of five from Maryland; and her life was taken at the hands of a monster who should have NEVER been here in the first place. The Fake News should be focusing on the beautiful life and tragic death of this Maryland Mother; rather than the so-called “Maryland Father;” who is actually an MS-13 Gang Member and Foreign Terrorist from El Salvador. We will never forget Rachel Morin; and are committed to protecting women like her across our Country. We will deport Illegal Murderers; Rapists; and Criminals. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

President Putin; and everyone else; respected your President! I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS WAR; BUT AM WORKING DILIGENTLY TO GET THE DEATH AND DESTRUCTION TO STOP. If the 2020 Presidential Election was not RIGGED; and it was; in so many ways; that horrible War would never have happened. President Zelenskyy and Crooked Joe Biden did an absolutely horrible job in allowing this travesty to begin. There were so many ways of preventing it from ever starting. But that is the past. Now we have to get it to STOP; AND FAST. SO SAD!

0,Almost every week; 60 Minutes; which is being sued for Billions of Dollars for the fraud they committed in the 2024 Presidential Election with their Interview of Failed Presidential Candidate Kamala Harris; mentions the name “TRUMP” in a derogatory and defamatory way; but this Weekend’s “BROADCAST” tops them all. They did not one; but TWO; major stories on “TRUMP;” one having to do with Ukraine; which I say is a War that would never have happened if the 2020 Election had not been RIGGED; in other words; if I were President and; the other story was having to do with Greenland; casting our Country; as led by me; falsely; inaccurately; and fraudulently. I am so honored to be suing 60 Minutes; CBS Fake News; and Paramount; over their fraudulent; beyond recognition; reporting. They did everything possible to illegally elect Kamala; including completely and corruptly changing major answers to Interview questions; but it just didn’t work for them. They are not a “News Show;” but a dishonest Political Operative simply disguised as “News;” and must be responsible for what they have done; and are doing. They should lose their license! Hopefully; the Federal Communications Commission (FCC); as headed by its Highly Respected Chairman; Brendan Carr; will impose the maximum fines and punishment; which is substantial; for their unlawful and illegal behavior. CBS is out of control; at levels never seen before; and they should pay a big price for this. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
0,I just finished watching 60 Minutes; the FAKE News Show that was scandalously responsible for REMOVING a terrible and incompetently delivered answer; by failed Presidential Candidate Kamala Harris; to an interview on 60 Minutes; just prior to Election Day; and putting in its place a completely different answer to a completely different question; in order to make Kamala look “coherent.” Now tonight; with two separate but highly inaccurate stories about “TRUMP;” they’re at it again. The people at CBS Fake News just don’t get it!

0,Time for the terrorists to hide; but it won’t do them any good. Our Warfighters; the Greatest the World has ever seen; will find them; and bring them to swift Justice. I just got rid of Joe Biden’s dangerous red tape; and empowered our Warfighters; once again; just like I did against our fight with ISIS; who were completely obliterated in three weeks under General Daniel Caine; our new Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. We will support the Somali People; who should not allow the Houthis to embed (which they are trying to do!); to end terrorism; and bring prosperity to their Country.
0,NOBODY is getting “off the hook” for the unfair Trade Balances; and Non Monetary Tariff Barriers; that other Countries have used against us; especially not China which; by far; treats us the worst! There was no Tariff “exception” announced on Friday. These products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs; and they are just moving to a different Tariff “bucket.” The Fake News knows this; but refuses to report it. We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations. What has been exposed is that we need to make products in the United States; and that we will not be held hostage by other Countries; especially hostile trading Nations like China; which will do everything within its power to disrespect the American People. We also cannot let them continue to abuse us on Trade; like they have for decades; THOSE DAYS ARE OVER! The Golden Age of America; which includes the upcoming Tax and Regulation Cuts; a substantial amount of which was just approved by the House and Senate; will mean more and better paying Jobs; making products in our Nation; and treating other Countries; in particular China; the same way they have treated us. The bottom line is that our Country will be bigger; better; and stronger than ever before. We will; MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Ted Cruz has been leading the fight to get South Texas the water it is owed; but Sleepy Joe refused to lift a finger to help the Farmers.THAT ENDS NOW! I will make sure Mexico doesn’t violate our Treaties; and doesn’t hurt our Texas Farmers. Just last month; I halted water shipments to Tijuana until Mexico complies with the 1944 Water Treaty. My Agriculture Secretary; Brooke Rollins; is standing up for Texas Farmers; and we will keep escalating consequences; including TARIFFS and; maybe even SANCTIONS; until Mexico honors the Treaty; and GIVES TEXAS THE WATER THEY ARE OWED!

At some point; hopefully in the near future; China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A.; and other Countries; is no longer sustainable or acceptable. Conversely; and based on the fact that more than 75 Countries have called Representatives of the United States; including the Departments of Commerce; Treasury; and the USTR; to negotiate a solution to the subjects being discussed relative to Trade; Trade Barriers; Tariffs; Currency Manipulation; and Non Monetary Tariffs; and that these Countries have not; at my strong suggestion; retaliated in any way; shape; or form against the United States; I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE; and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period; of 10%; also effective immediately.

They began these Military payments during my first term; Billions of Dollars; but Sleepy Joe Biden; for reasons unknown; terminated the deal. That was a shocker to all! In any event; we have the confines and probability of a great DEAL for both countries. Their top TEAM is on a plane heading to the U.S.; and things are looking good. We are likewise dealing with many other countries; all of whom want to make a deal with the United States. Like with South Korea; we are bringing up other subjects that are not covered by Trade and Tariffs; and getting them negotiated also. “ONE STOP SHOPPING” is a beautiful and efficient process!!! China also wants to make a deal; badly; but they don’t know how to get it started. We are waiting for their call. It will happen! GOD BLESS THE USA.

THE HOUSE MUST PASS THIS BUDGET RESOLUTION; AND QUICKLY — MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

0,Yesterday; China issued Retaliatory Tariffs of 34%; on top of their already record setting Tariffs; Non-Monetary Tariffs; Illegal Subsidization of companies; and massive long term Currency Manipulation; despite my warning that any country that Retaliates against the U.S. by issuing additional Tariffs; above and beyond their already existing long term Tariff abuse of our Nation; will be immediately met with new and substantially higher Tariffs; over and above those initially set. Therefore; if China does not withdraw its 34% increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow; April 8th; 2025; the United States will impose ADDITIONAL Tariffs on China of 50%; effective April 9th. Additionally; all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated! Negotiations with other countries; which have also requested meetings; will begin taking place immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter!

0,Countries from all over the World are talking to us. Tough but fair parameters are being set. Spoke to the Japanese Prime Minister this morning. He is sending a top team to negotiate! They have treated the U.S. very poorly on Trade. They don’t take our cars; but we take MILLIONS of theirs. Likewise Agriculture; and many other “things.” It all has to change; but especially with CHINA!!!
0,The United States has a chance to do something that should have been done DECADES AGO. Don’t be Weak! Don’t be Stupid! Don’t be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!). Be Strong; Courageous; and Patient; and GREATNESS will be the result!
0,Oil prices are down; interest rates are down (the slow moving Fed should cut rates!); food prices are down; there is NO INFLATION; and the long time abused USA is bringing in Billions of Dollars a week from the abusing countries on Tariffs that are already in place. This is despite the fact that the biggest abuser of them all; China; whose markets are crashing; just raised its Tariffs by 34%; on top of its long term ridiculously high Tariffs (Plus!); not acknowledging my warning for abusing countries not to retaliate. They’ve made enough; for decades; taking advantage of the Good OL’ USA! Our past “leaders” are to blame for allowing this; and so much else; to happen to our Country. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
0,We have massive Financial Deficits with China; the European Union; and many others. The only way this problem can be cured is with TARIFFS; which are now bringing Tens of Billions of Dollars into the U.S.A. They are already in effect; and a beautiful thing to behold. The Surplus with these Countries has grown during the “Presidency” of Sleepy Joe Biden. We are going to reverse it; and reverse it QUICKLY. Some day people will realize that Tariffs; for the United States of America; are a very beautiful thing!

0,China has been hit much harder than the USA; not even close. They; and many other nations; have treated us unsustainably badly. We have been the dumb and helpless “whipping post;” but not any longer. We are bringing back jobs and businesses like never before. Already; more than FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS OF INVESTMENT; and rising fast! THIS IS AN ECONOMIC REVOLUTION; AND WE WILL WIN. HANG TOUGH; it won’t be easy; but the end result will be historic.

The Deal requires more work to ensure all necessary approvals are signed; which is why I am signing an Executive Order to keep TikTok up and running for an additional 75 days. We hope to continue working in Good Faith with China; who I understand are not very happy about our Reciprocal Tariffs (Necessary for Fair and Balanced Trade between China and the U.S.A.!). This proves that Tariffs are the most powerful Economic tool; and very important to our National Security! We do not want TikTok to “go dark.” We look forward to working with TikTok and China to close the Deal. Thank you for your attention to this matter!
0,This would be a PERFECT time for Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to cut Interest Rates. He is always “late;” but he could now change his image; and quickly.

0,The Witch Hunt against Marine Le Pen is another example of European Leftists using Lawfare to silence Free Speech; and censor their Political Opponent; this time going so far as to put that Opponent in prison. It is the same “playbook” that was used against me by a group of Lunatics and Losers; like Norm Eisen; Andrew Weissmann; and Lisa Monaco. They spent the last nine years thinking of nothing else; and they FAILED; because the People of the United States realized that they were only Corrupt Lawyers and Politicians. I don’t know Marine Le Pen; but do appreciate how hard she worked for so many years. She suffered losses; but kept on going; and now; just before what would be a Big Victory; they get her on a minor charge that she probably knew nothing about – Sounds like a “bookkeeping” error to me. It is all so bad for France; and the Great French People; no matter what side they are on. FREE MARINE LE PEN!

They are playing with the lives of the American people; and right into the hands of the Radical Left Democrats and Drug Cartels. The Senate Bill is just a ploy of the Dems to show and expose the weakness of certain Republicans; namely these four; in that it is not going anywhere because the House will never approve it and I; as your President; will never sign it. Why are they allowing Fentanyl to pour into our Country unchecked; and without penalty. What is wrong with them; other than suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome; commonly known as TDS? Who can want this to happen to our beautiful families; and why? To the people of the Great States of Kentucky; Alaska; and Maine; please contact these Senators and get them to FINALLY adhere to Republican Values and Ideals.

Willkie will provide a total of at least $100 Million Dollars in pro bono Legal Services; during the Trump Administration; and beyond; to causes that President Trump and Willkie both support; in relation to the following areas: Assisting Veterans and other Public Servants including; among others; members of the Military; Gold Star families; Law Enforcement; and First Responders; Ensuring fairness in our Justice System; and Combatting Antisemitism.

Willkie affirms that it will not deny representation to clients; such as members of politically disenfranchised groups and Government Officials; employees; and advisors; who have not historically received Legal representation from major National Law Firms; including in pro bono matters and in support of non-profits; because of the personal political views of individual lawyers.Statement from the White House: “Willkie Farr &amp; Gallagher LLP proactively reached out to President Trump and his Administration; offering their decisive commitment to ending the Weaponization of the Justice System and the Legal Profession. The President is delivering on his promises of eradicating Partisan Lawfare in America; and restoring Liberty and Justice FOR ALL.”Statement from Thomas M. Cerabino; Chairman of Willkie Farr &amp; Gallagher LLP: ""We reached an agreement with President Trump and his Administration on matters of great importance to our Firm.

The Firm looks forward to having a constructive relationship with the Trump Administration; and remains committed to serving the needs of our clients; our employees; and the communities of which we are a part.”"

By their weakness; the Democrats have allowed Fentanyl to get out of hand. The Republicans and I have reversed that course; strongly and quickly. Major additional progress is being made.

We hit them every day and night — Harder and harder. Their capabilities that threaten Shipping and the Region are rapidly being destroyed. Our attacks will continue until they are no longer a threat to Freedom of Navigation. The choice for the Houthis is clear: Stop shooting at U.S. ships; and we will stop shooting at you. Otherwise; we have only just begun; and the real pain is yet to come; for both the Houthis and their sponsors in Iran.

0,I got a call from a very good guy; and friend of mine; Kid Rock; asking me whether or not it would be possible for me to meet; in the White House; with Bill Maher; a man who has been unjustifiably critical of anything; or anyone; TRUMP. I really didn’t like the idea much; and don’t like it much now; but thought it would be interesting. The problem is; no matter how much he likes your Favorite President; ME; he will publicly proclaim what a terrible guy I am; etc.; very much like the Democrats at my recent Address to the Joint Session of Congress; where I stated; correctly; that no matter what I said or did; they wouldn’t stand; they wouldn’t applaud; they wouldn’t smile or laugh and; certainly; they wouldn’t be in any way “nice.” Who knows; though; maybe I’ll be proven wrong? In any event; I’m doing a favor for a friend. I look forward to meeting with Bill Maher; Kid Rock and; I believe; even the Legendary Dana White will be present. It might be fun or; it might not; but you will be the first to know!
0,I was just informed by Prime Minister Starmer of the United Kingdom; that they caught the terrorists who attacked the beautiful Turnberry; in Scotland. They did serious damage; and will hopefully be treated harshly. The three people who did this are in prison. You cannot let things like this attack happen; and I greatly appreciate the work of Prime Minister Starmer; and UK Law Enforcement.
0,Kristen Welker’s entire first half hour of the Lowly Rated Meet the Fake Press this morning; was devoted to the boring Signal Witch Hunt. She doesn’t want to talk in detail about anything that matters like how well we are doing against the Houthis; substantive Peace Talks with Russia and Ukraine or; Iran; Iran; Iran. She wastes my Administration’s time by talking to them about “NOTHING.” Why can’t NBC; one of the Worst Broadcasters on Television; hire people that are honest and credible? The reason they don’t is because their Chairman; Brian Roberts; is a pathetic Loser; who is petrified of the Left; and always will be. Comcast’s MSNBC and NBC have fought me for years; spending almost all of their waking hours making up Fake Stories — and look; I’m PRESIDENT; with really high Poll Numbers and Great Accomplishments. Good job Brian!
0,Brad Schimel’s Opponent; Susan Crawford; is a DISASTER! She is so Far Left that even her own Party; the Radical Democrats; don’t want ANYTHING to do with her. Wisconsin Values are perfectly represented by Brad Schimel. He is Conservative; Strong and; above all; SANE. His Opponent is a Liberal Lunatic who will throw our Country; and the State of Wisconsin; into TOTAL CHAOS. Vote for Brad Schimel!
0,A GREAT job by Senator Markwayne Mullin on beating back Kristen Welker’s; and the the Radical Left’s Witch Hunt; on the never ending Signal story. They just don’t stop - Over and over they go! Meet the Fake Press should instead explain how successful the attack was; and how Sleepy Joe Biden should have done it YEARS AGO. This story and narrative is so old and boring; but only used because we are having the most successful “First One Hundred Presidential Days” in the history of America; and they can’t find anything else to talk about. The Fake News Media has the lowest Approval Ratings in history; and for good reason. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!
0,Working together with a fantastic and very talented Executive Residence Staff; along with the wonderful people at the National Park Service; we are making tremendous enhancements to the White House; thereby preserving and protecting History! One of the interesting dilemmas is a tree planted many years ago by the Legendary President and General; Andrew Jackson. It is a Southern Magnolia; that came from his home; The Hermitage; in Tennessee. That’s the good news! The bad news is that everything must come to an end; and this tree is in terrible condition; a very dangerous safety hazard; at the White House Entrance; no less; and must now be removed. This process will take place next week; and will be replaced by another; very beautiful tree. The Historic wood from the tree will be preserved by the White House Staff; and may be used for other high and noble purposes!!!

0,RT @mrddmiaDear President Trump:Please revoke Judge Boasberg's security clearance.He has demonstrated he cannot be trusted with keeping secrets.
0,People are shocked by what is going on with the Court System. I was elected for many reasons; but a principal one was LAW AND ORDER; a big part of which is QUICKLY removing a vast Criminal Network of individuals; who came into our Country through the Crooked Joe Biden Open Borders Policy! These are dangerous and violent people; who kill; maim and; in many other ways; harm the people of our Country. The Voters want them OUT; and said so in Record Numbers. If it was up to District Judge Boasberg and other Radical Left Judges; nobody would be removed; the President wouldn’t be allowed to do his job; and people’s lives would be devastated all throughout our Country. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
0,I just played a round of Golf with Alexander Stubb; President of Finland. He is a very good player; and we won the Men’s Member-Guest Golf Tournament at Trump International Golf Club in Palm Beach County; with the Legendary Gary Player; Senator Lindsey Graham; and former Congressman and highly successful Television Host; Trey Gowdy. President Stubb and I look forward to strengthening the partnership between the United States and Finland; and that includes the purchase and development of a large number of badly needed Icebreakers for the U.S.; delivering Peace and International Security for our Countries; and the World. President Stubb told me; in the most powerful of words; that the United States is STRONG; and BACK; AGAIN. I AGREE!

0,Today; President Donald J. Trump and Skadden; Arps; Slate; Meagher &amp; Flom LLP announce the following agreement regarding a series of actions to be taken by Skadden:1. Skadden will provide a total of at least $100 Million Dollars in pro bono Legal Services; during the Trump Administration and beyond; to causes that the President and Skadden both support; in relation to the following areas: Assisting Veterans and other Public Servants; including members of the Military; Law Enforcement; First Responders; and Federal; State; and Local Government Officials; ensuring fairness in our Justice System; and combatting Antisemitism. Skadden will change its pro bono policy so that all pro bono moving forward will be done in the Firm name. A pro bono Committee will be constituted to ensure that pro bono matters are consistent with the objectives of the program; and that pro bono activities represent the full political spectrum.2. The Skadden Foundation will commit to the mission of providing pro bono Legal Services to a wide variety of deserving organizations and individuals. Skadden is committed to funding no fewer than five Skadden Fellows each year dedicated to the following projects: Assisting Veterans; ensuring fairness in our Justice System; combatting Antisemitism; and other similar types of projects.

Skadden will engage independent outside counsel to advise the Firm to ensure employment practices are fully compliant with Law; including; but not limited to; anti-discrimination Laws.4. Skadden will not deny representation to clients; such as members of politically disenfranchised groups; who have not historically received legal representation from major National Law Firms; including in pro bono matters; and in support of non-profits; because of the personal political views of individual lawyers.Statement From the White House: “Skadden; Arps; Slate; Meagher &amp; Flom LLP approached President Trump and his Administration; and declared the Firm’s strong commitment to ending the Weaponization of the Justice System and the Legal Profession. The President will never stop fighting to deliver on his promises of eradicating partisan Lawfare in America; and restoring Liberty &amp; Justice for ALL.”Statement From Skadden Executive Partner; Jeremy London: “Skadden is pleased to have achieved a successful agreement with President Trump and his Administration.

0,How disgraceful is it that “Judge” James Boasberg has just been given a fourth “Trump Case;” something which is; statistically; IMPOSSIBLE. There is no way for a Republican; especially a TRUMP REPUBLICAN; to win before him. He is Highly Conflicted; not only in his hatred of me — Massive Trump Derangement Syndrome! — but also; because of disqualifying family conflicts. Boasberg; who is the Chief Judge of the D.C. District Court; seems to be grabbing the “Trump Cases” all to himself; even though it is not supposed to happen that way. Is there still such a thing as the “wheel;” where the Judges are chosen fairly; and at random? The good news is that it probably doesn’t matter; because it is virtually impossible for me to get an Honest Ruling in D.C. Our Nation’s Courts are broken; with New York and D.C. being the most preeminent of all in their Corruption and Radicalism. There must be an immediate investigation of this Rigged System; before it is too late!

Among the gangs they sent to the United States; is Tren de Aragua; which has been given the designation of “Foreign Terrorist Organization.” We are in the process of returning them to Venezuela — It is a big task! In addition; Venezuela has been very hostile to the United States and the Freedoms which we espouse. Therefore; any Country that purchases Oil and/or Gas from Venezuela will be forced to pay a Tariff of 25% to the United States on any Trade they do with our Country. All documentation will be signed and registered; and the Tariff will take place on April 2nd; 2025; LIBERATION DAY IN AMERICA. Please let this notification serve to represent that the Department of Homeland Security; Border Patrol; and all other Law Enforcement Agencies within our Country have been so notified.

0,Why would the now highly discredited 60 Minutes be doing a total “puff piece” on George Clooney; a second rate movie “star;” and failed political pundit. He fought hard for Sleepy Joe’s election and then; right after the Debate; dumped him like a dog. Later; I assume under orders from the Obama camp; pushed all out for “Kamala;” only to soon realize that that was not going to work out to well. 60 Minutes even fraudulently inserted Fake answers into her disastrous interview; aired just before Election Day; in one of the most embarrassing and dishonest events in broadcast history…And now George Clooney again? His press agent should be making a fortune!!!
0,Nobody likes a bad picture or painting of themselves; but the one in Colorado; in the State Capitol; put up by the Governor; along with all other Presidents; was purposefully distorted to a level that even I; perhaps; have never seen before. The artist also did President Obama; and he looks wonderful; but the one on me is truly the worst. She must have lost her talent as she got older. In any event; I would much prefer not having a picture than having this one; but many people from Colorado have called and written to complain. In fact; they are actually angry about it! I am speaking on their behalf to the Radical Left Governor; Jared Polis; who is extremely weak on Crime; in particular with respect to Tren de Aragua; which practically took over Aurora (Don’t worry; we saved it!); to take it down. Jared should be ashamed of himself!
0,But he doesn’t mind if criminals come into our Country. He is a Constitutional disaster! DJT
0,I just watched our GREAT Republican Congressman from North Carolina; CHUCK EDWARDS; hold a Town Hall in Asheville. He was a total gentleman; but the room was “littered” with Radical Left Lunatics; mostly Democrats; and all they did was scream; shout and use filthy language. They were largely paid agitators; with fake signs and slogans; and were only there to make TROUBLE! Chuck put up with it; and was WONDERFUL! Remember; BIDEN AND HIS FEMA DID NOTHING FOR NORTH CAROLINA and the terrible hurricane which did so much damage. As soon as I got to office; we worked miracles; with ZERO HELP FROM THE DEMS. WE HAVE BEEN PRAISED FOR THE JOB THAT WE DID; AND THE DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN SCORNED. Also remember; you have a Democrat Governor who is supposed to be doing the work that Chuck; and other Republicans; are doing. Don’t let infiltrated Town Halls fool you. It the only thing the Dems know how to do. Great Job Chuck!!!

Therefore; we need a full throated apology from the Governor herself; and a statement that she will never make such an unlawful challenge to the Federal Government again; before this case can be settled. I’m sure she will be able to do that quite easily. Thank you for your attention to this matter and; MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!   DJT

0,“Elon Musk will be briefed by the Pentagon about the USA’s top secret plans against China should there be a War;”according to the Failing New York Times; one of the worst and most purposely inaccurate newspapers anywhere in the World. Their FAKE concept for this story is that because Elon does some business in China; that he is very conflicted and would immediately go to top Chinese officials and “spill the beans.” RATINGS CHALLENGED FAKE NEWS CNN immediately picked up on this absolutely ridiculous and false story; which is probably libelous; and went heavy with it. Fortunately; nobody was watching! Maggot Hagerman; the really dumb “scammer” who constantly writes about me for the Times; using anonymous; made up (nonexistent!) sources; and who I haven’t spoken to in ages; is a big part of the Scam.

0,Unlawful Nationwide Injunctions by Radical Left Judges could very well lead to the destruction of our Country! These people are Lunatics; who do not care; even a little bit; about the repercussions from their very dangerous and incorrect Decisions and Rulings. Lawyers endlessly search the United States for these Judges; and file lawsuits as quickly as they find them. It is then the obligation of Law abiding Agencies of Government to have these “Orders” overturned. The danger is unparalleled! These Judges want to assume the Powers of the Presidency; without having to attain 80 Million Votes. They want all of the advantages with none of the risks. Again; a President has to be allowed to act quickly and decisively about such matters as returning murderers; drug lords; rapists; and other such type criminals back to their Homeland; or to other locations that will allow our Country to be SAFE. It is our goal to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN; and such a high aspiration can never be done if Radical and Highly Partisan Judges are allowed to stand in the way of JUSTICE. STOP NATIONWIDE INJUNCTIONS NOW; BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE. If Justice Roberts and the United States Supreme Court do not fix this toxic and unprecedented situation IMMEDIATELY; our Country is in very serious trouble!
0,Today; President Donald J. Trump agreed to withdraw his March 14; 2025 Executive Order regarding the Paul; Weiss; Rifkind; Wharton &amp; Garrison LLP law firm (“Paul; Weiss”); which has entered into the following agreement with the President: 1. Paul; Weiss agrees that the bedrock principle of American Justice is that it must be fair and nonpartisan for all. Our Justice System is betrayed when it is misused to achieve political ends.Lawyers and law firms play a vital role in ensuring that we live up to that standard as a Nation. Law firms should not favor any political party when it comes to choosing their clients. Firms also should not make decisions on whom to hire based on a person’s political affiliation. To do otherwise is to deny some Americans an equal opportunity for our services while favoring others.  Lawyers abandon the profession’s highest ideals when they engage in partisan decision-making; and betray the ethical obligation to represent those who are unpopular or disfavored in a particular environment.  2. Paul; Weiss affirms its unwavering commitment to these core ideals and principles; and will not deny representation to clients; including in pro bono matters and in support of non-profits; because of the personal political views of individual lawyers.  3. Paul; Weiss will take on a wide range of pro bono matters that represent the full spectrum of political viewpoints of our society; whether “conservative” or “liberal.”4. Paul; Weiss affirms its commitment to merit-based hiring; promotion; and retention; and will not adopt; use; or pursue any DEI policies. As part of its commitment; it will engage experts; to be mutually agreed upon within 14 days; to conduct a comprehensive audit of all of its employment practices.5. Paul; Weiss will dedicate the equivalent of $40 million in pro bono legal services over the course of President Trump’s term to support the Administration’s initiatives; including: assisting our Nation’s veterans; fairness in the Justice System; the President’s Task Force to Combat Antisemitism; and other mutually agreed projects.Statement from the White House: “The President is agreeing to this action in light of a meeting with Paul; Weiss Chairman; Brad Karp; during which Mr. Karp acknowledged the wrongdoing of former Paul; Weiss partner; Mark Pomerantz; the grave dangers of Weaponization; and the vital need to restore our System of Justice.”In response to the President’s announcement; Paul; Weiss’s Chairman Brad Karp said: “We are gratified that the President has agreed to withdraw the Executive Order concerning Paul; Weiss. We look forward to an engaged and constructive relationship with the President and his Administration.”

This began when I asked Elon Musk to go up and get the abandoned Astronauts; because the Biden Administration was incapable of doing so. They shamefully forgot about the Astronauts; because they considered it to be a very embarrassing event for them – Another thing I inherited from that failed group of incompetents. Elon and I have taken on the project; sending up the SpaceX Dragon; which has successfully docked and; hopefully; while there is always danger involved in such a mission; they will soon be on their way home — Taking off tomorrow; and landing on Wednesday. Exact times will be provided to you. Safety always comes first; and maximum standards are being adhered to. But after eight long months for a mission that was supposed to be eight days; IT IS TIME. I look forward to seeing Butch and Suni; and thank you again to NASA and Janet Petro!
0,Let nobody be fooled! The hundreds of attacks being made by Houthi; the sinister mobsters and thugs based in Yemen; who are hated by the Yemeni people; all emanate from; and are created by; IRAN. Any further attack or retaliation by the “Houthis” will be met with great force; and there is no guarantee that that force will stop there. Iran has played “the innocent victim” of rogue terrorists from which they’ve lost control; but they haven’t lost control. They’re dictating every move; giving them the weapons; supplying them with money and highly sophisticated Military equipment; and even; so-called; “Intelligence.” Every shot fired by the Houthis will be looked upon; from this point forward; as being a shot fired from the weapons and leadership of IRAN; and IRAN will be held responsible; and suffer the consequences; and those consequences will be dire!DONALD J.

In other words; Joe Biden did not sign them but; more importantly; he did not know anything about them! The necessary Pardoning Documents were not explained to; or approved by; Biden. He knew nothing about them; and the people that did may have committed a crime. Therefore; those on the Unselect Committee; who destroyed and deleted ALL evidence obtained during their two year Witch Hunt of me; and many other innocent people; should fully understand that they are subject to investigation at the highest level. The fact is; they were probably responsible for the Documents that were signed on their behalf without the knowledge or consent of the Worst President in the History of our Country; Crooked Joe Biden!

Thank you to El Salvador and; in particular; President Bukele; for your understanding of this horrible situation; which was allowed to happen to the United States because of incompetent Democrat leadership. We will not forget!
0,I just won the Golf Club Championship; probably my last; at Trump International Golf Club; in Palm Beach County; Florida. Such a great honor! The Awards dinner is tonight; at the Club. I want to thank the wonderful Golf Staff; and all of the many fantastic golfers; that participated in the even. Such fun!
0,I am pleased to inform you that General Keith Kellogg has been appointed Special Envoy to Ukraine. General Kellogg; a Highly Respected Military Expert; will deal directly with President Zelenskyy; and Ukrainian leadership. He knows them well; and they have a very good working relationship together. Congratulations to General Kellogg!
0,Today; I have ordered the United States Military to launch decisive and powerful Military action against the Houthi terrorists in Yemen. They have waged an unrelenting campaign of piracy; violence; and terrorism against American; and other; ships; aircraft; and drones.Joe Biden’s response was pathetically weak; so the unrestrained Houthis just kept going. It has been over a year since a U.S. flagged commercial ship safely sailed through the Suez Canal; the Red Sea; or the Gulf of Aden. The last American Warship to go through the Red Sea; four months ago; was attacked by the Houthis over a dozen times. Funded by Iran; the Houthi thugs have fired missiles at U.S. aircraft; and targeted our Troops and Allies. These relentless assaults have cost the U.S. and World Economy many BILLIONS of Dollars while; at the same time; putting innocent lives at risk.The Houthi attack on American vessels will not be tolerated. We will use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective. The Houthis have choked off shipping in one of the most important Waterways of the World; grinding vast swaths of Global Commerce to a halt; and attacking the core principle of Freedom of Navigation upon which International Trade and Commerce depends.Our brave Warfighters are right now carrying out aerial attacks on the terrorists’ bases; leaders; and missile defenses to protect American shipping; air; and naval assets; and to restore Navigational Freedom. No terrorist force will stop American commercial and naval vessels from freely sailing the Waterways of the World.To all Houthi terrorists; YOUR TIME IS UP; AND YOUR ATTACKS MUST STOP; STARTING TODAY. IF THEY DON’T; HELL WILL RAIN DOWN UPON YOU LIKE NOTHING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE!To Iran: Support for the Houthi terrorists must end IMMEDIATELY! Do NOT threaten the American People; their President; who has received one of the largest mandates in Presidential History; or Worldwide shipping lanes. If you do; BEWARE; because America will hold you fully accountable and; we won’t be nice about it!
0,The Fake News; as usual; is at it again! Why can’t they be honest; just for once? Last night I read that President Vladimir Putin of Russia kept my Highly Respected Ambassador and Special Envoy; Steve Witkoff; waiting for over nine hours when; in fact; there was no wait whatsoever. Other meetings with other Representatives of Russia did take place and; obviously; they took some time; but they were very productive. From there; things went quickly and efficiently; and all signs seem to be; hopefully; very good! In conclusion; there was no nine hour wait; or any wait at all! The only reason they made up that story is to try and DEMEAN; because they are sick degenerates; that have to start reporting the News correctly. This is why they have lost their ratings; their audience; and respect. Thank you for your attention to this matter and; GOD BLESS AMERICA!DONALD J. TRUMP; PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

0,TO THE HEROIC MEN AND WOMEN OF LAW ENFORCEMENT…
0,We're joined today by dozens of police officers; Sheriffs; and Sheriff's Deputies from all across the Country. My message to these law enforcement heroes is simple: With me in the White House; you once again have a President who will always have your back…
0,In everything we do; we're restoring law; restoring order and restoring public safety in America...and we're bringing honor and integrity and accountability back to the highest levels of the FBI; DOJ; and throughout our government…
0,Crooked Joe Biden got us into a real mess with Russia and everything else he did…
0,On day one; I signed an executive order banning all government censorship. My administration stripped the security clearances of the disgraced intelligence agents who lied about Hunter Biden's laptop. We revoked the clearances of deranged Jack Smith; Alvin Bragg; Letitia James; and the corrupt law firms — I pardoned hundreds of political prisoners who had been grossly mistreated…
0,We must be honest about the lies and abuses that have occurred within these walls. Unfortunately; in recent years; a corrupt group of hacks and radicals within the ranks of the American government obliterated the trust and goodwill built up over generations…
0,Our predecessors turned the Department of Justice into the Department of INJUSTICE—But I stand before you today to declare that those days are over!
0,For generations; the Federal Department of Justice was one of America's most revered institutions...This department commanded the respect and admiration of the entire world...
0,As we begin a proud new chapter in the chronicles of American Justice; we're turning the page on four long years of corruption; weaponization; and surrender to violent criminals...

0,We had very good and productive discussions with President Vladimir Putin of Russia yesterday; and there is a very good chance that this horrible; bloody war can finally come to an end — BUT; AT THIS VERY MOMENT; THOUSANDS OF UKRAINIAN TROOPS ARE COMPLETELY SURROUNDED BY THE RUSSIAN MILITARY; AND IN A VERY BAD AND VULNERABLE POSITION. I have strongly requested to President Putin that their lives be spared. This would be a horrible massacre; one not seen since World War II. God bless them all!!!
0,Congratulations to Chuck Schumer for doing the right thing — Took “guts” and courage! The big Tax Cuts; L.A. fire fix; Debt Ceiling Bill; and so much more; is coming. We should all work together on that very dangerous situation. A non pass would be a Country destroyer; approval will lead us to new heights. Again; really good and smart move by Senator Schumer. This could lead to something big for the USA; a whole new direction and beginning! DJT
0,Our Economy will BOOM; like never before!
0,Crooked Joe Biden got us into a real “mess” with Russia (and EVERYTHING ELSE!); but I’m going to get us out. Millions of people are needlessly dead; never to be seen again…and there will be many more to follow if we don’t get the Cease Fire and Final Agreement with Russia completed and signed. There would have been NO WAR if I were President. It just; 100%; would not have happened. Likewise; there would have been no October 7th with Israel; the pullout from Afghanistan would have been done with strength and pride; and would not have been the most embarrassing day in the history of our Country; it could have been a moment of glory. Also; there would not have been any perceptible inflation - Instead we had Record Setting; Country Destroying Inflation; like we have never seen before. Also; we would have had an impenetrable Border; with very few illegals getting in. Oh; what a difference A RIGGED &amp; CROOKED ELECTION HAD ON OUR COUNTRY; AND THE PEOPLE WHO DID THIS TO US SHOULD GO TO JAIL! GOD BLESS AMERICA AND; MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

0,If New York; Connecticut; and New England had their Pipelines; savings from Heating alone would go down $2;300 per family — When you add Air Conditioning; and other things; you would have a $5;000 savings per family. All we need is a simple approval from New York. Every other State in New England; plus Connecticut; wants this; in order to help the Environment; and save BIG money. We only need the final approval from New York State; whose people all want it. Otherwise; we’ll have to use other authorities. New York State has held up this project for many years; but we won’t let that happen any longer. We will use federal approval!

0,The Globalist Wall Street Journal has no idea what they are doing or saying. They are owned by the polluted thinking of the European Union; which was formed for the primary purpose of “screwing” the United States of America. Their (WSJ!) thinking is antiquated and weak; and very bad for the USA. But have no fear; we will WIN on everything!!! Egg prices are down; oil is down; interest rates are down; and TARIFF RELATED MONEY IS POURING INTO THE UNITED STATES. “The only thing you have to fear; is fear itself!”
0,The European Union; one of the most hostile and abusive taxing and tariffing authorities in the World; which was formed for the sole purpose of taking advantage of the United States; has just put a nasty 50% Tariff on Whisky. If this Tariff is not removed immediately; the U.S. will shortly place a 200% Tariff on all WINES; CHAMPAGNES; &amp; ALCOHOLIC PRODUCTS COMING OUT OF FRANCE AND OTHER E.U. REPRESENTED COUNTRIES. This will be great for the Wine and Champagne businesses in the U.S.

0,“Congressman” Thomas Massie voted to delay the Debt Ceiling Bill from the Biden Administration to the Trump Administration (from September before the Election; to June after the Election!); without getting anything for this horrendously stupid move — When Republicans could have gotten EVERYTHING they wanted. He additionally voted to delay the current Budget Disaster from the Biden Administration to the Trump Administration. I was running for Office at the time; doing my thing; and when I heard about this; it was; quite simply; hard to believe — A catastrophic mistake! Now; and virtually on every other vote; he’s a very simple; “NO.” He can’t even approve a Continuing Resolution when he approved them many times during his career as a “Congressman.” Thomas Massie is a GRANDSTANDER; and the Great People of Kentucky are going to be watching a very interesting Primary in the not too distant future!
0,Why would our Country allow another Country to supply us with electricity; even for a small area? Who made these decisions; and why? And can you imagine Canada stooping so low as to use ELECTRICITY; that so affects the life of innocent people; as a bargaining chip and threat? They will pay a financial price for this so big that it will be read about in History Books for many years to come!
0,Based on Ontario; Canada; placing a 25% Tariff on “Electricity” coming into the United States; I have instructed my Secretary of Commerce to add an ADDITIONAL 25% Tariff; to 50%; on all STEEL and ALUMINUM COMING INTO THE UNITED STATES FROM CANADA; ONE OF THE HIGHEST TARIFFING NATIONS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. This will go into effect TOMORROW MORNING; March 12th. Also; Canada must immediately drop their Anti-American Farmer Tariff of 250% to 390% on various U.S. dairy products; which has long been considered outrageous. I will shortly be declaring a National Emergency on Electricity within the threatened area. This will allow the U.S to quickly do what has to be done to alleviate this abusive threat from Canada. If other egregious; long time Tariffs are not likewise dropped by Canada; I will substantially increase; on April 2nd; the Tariffs on Cars coming into the U.S. which will; essentially; permanently shut down the automobile manufacturing business in Canada. Those cars can easily be made in the USA! Also; Canada pays very little for National Security; relying on the United States for military protection. We are subsidizing Canada to the tune of more than 200 Billion Dollars a year. WHY??? This cannot continue. The only thing that makes sense is for Canada to become our cherished Fifty First State. This would make all Tariffs; and everything else; totally disappear. Canadians’ taxes will be very substantially reduced; they will be more secure; militarily and otherwise; than ever before; there would no longer be a Northern Border problem; and the greatest and most powerful nation in the World will be bigger; better and stronger than ever — And Canada will be a big part of that. The artificial line of separation drawn many years ago will finally disappear; and we will have the safest and most beautiful Nation anywhere in the World — And your brilliant anthem; “O Canada;” will continue to play; but now representing a GREAT and POWERFUL STATE within the greatest Nation that the World has ever seen!
0,To Republicans; Conservatives; and all great Americans; Elon Musk is “putting it on the line” in order to help our Nation; and he is doing a FANTASTIC JOB! But the Radical Left Lunatics; as they often do; are trying to illegally and collusively boycott Tesla; one of the World’s great automakers; and Elon’s “baby;” in order to attack and do harm to Elon; and everything he stands for. They tried to do it to me at the 2024 Presidential Ballot Box; but how did that work out? In any event; I’m going to buy a brand new Tesla tomorrow morning as a show of confidence and support for Elon Musk; a truly great American. Why should he be punished for putting his tremendous skills to work in order to help MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN???
0,Despite the fact that Canada is charging the USA from 250% to 390% Tariffs on many of our farm products; Ontario just announced a 25% surcharge on “electricity;” of all things; and your not even allowed to do that. Because our Tariffs are reciprocal; we’ll just get it all back on April 2. Canada is a Tariff abuser; and always has been; but the United States is not going to be subsidizing Canada any longer. We don’t need your Cars; we don’t need your Lumber; we don’t your Energy; and very soon; you will find that out. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!

0,Thank you to the House Freedom Caucus for just delivering a big blow to the Radical Left Democrats and their desire to raise Taxes and SHUT OUR COUNTRY DOWN! They hate America and all it stands for. That’s why they allowed MILLIONS of Criminals to invade our Nation. Sometimes it takes great courage to do the right thing. Congressman Thomas Massie; of beautiful Kentucky; is an automatic “NO” vote on just about everything; despite the fact that he has always voted for Continuing Resolutions in the past. HE SHOULD BE PRIMARIED; and I will lead the charge against him. He’s just another GRANDSTANDER; who’s too much trouble; and not worth the fight. He reminds me of Liz Chaney before her historic; record breaking fall (loss!). The people of Kentucky won’t stand for it; just watch. DO I HAVE ANY TAKERS??? Anyway; thank you again to the House Freedom Caucus for your very important vote. We need to buy some time in order to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN; GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE. Unite and Win!!!

0,Following my previously signed Executive Orders; ICE proudly apprehended and detained Mahmoud Khalil; a Radical Foreign Pro-Hamas Student on the campus of Columbia University. This is the first arrest of many to come. We know there are more students at Columbia and other Universities across the Country who have engaged in pro-terrorist; anti-Semitic; anti-American activity; and the Trump Administration will not tolerate it. Many are not students; they are paid agitators. We will find; apprehend; and deport these terrorist sympathizers from our country — never to return again. If you support terrorism; including the slaughtering of innocent men; women; and children; your presence is contrary to our national and foreign policy interests; and you are not welcome here. We expect every one of America’s Colleges and Universities to comply. Thank you!

0,Malcolm Turnbull; the former Prime Minister of Australia who was always leading that wonderful country from “behind;” never understood what was going on in China; nor did he have the capacity to do so. I always thought he was a weak and ineffective leader and; obviously; Australian’s agreed with me!!!
0,Great job by Congressman Brian Mast on FoxNews. He’s got it together!!! DJT
0,We're going to become so rich; you're not gonna know where to spend all that money. I'm telling you—just watch!
0,Democrats are out of control—They've lost their minds…

0,As I made clear during my Joint Address to Congress; the United States strongly supports the people of Greenland’s right to determine their own future. We will continue to KEEP YOU SAFE; as we have since World War II. We are ready to INVEST BILLIONS OF DOLLARS to create new jobs and MAKE YOU RICH — And; if you so choose; we welcome you to be a part of the Greatest Nation anywhere in the World; the United States of America!

0,The House and Senate have put together; under the circumstances; a very good funding Bill (“CR”)! All Republicans should vote (Please!) YES next week. Great things are coming for America; and I am asking you all to give us a few months to get us through to September so we can continue to put the Country’s “financial house” in order. Democrats will do anything they can to shut down our Government; and we can’t let that happen. We have to remain UNITED — NO DISSENT — Fight for another day when the timing is right. VERY IMPORTANT. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

0,Senator Eric Schmitt: “The shift that you're seeing in the foreign policy of the United States is a shift to REALISM — the American taxpayers are tapped out of this war in Ukraine. President Trump is trying to bring PEACE!”
0,Our GREAT United States Naval Academy needs a new Board of Visitors. I am pleased to announce that an incredible group of Patriots will serve on the Board— Walt Nauta; Sean Spicer; “Doc Ronnie” Jackson; and Derek Van Orden. Together they will ensure continued Greatness for the Academy!
0,Canada is cheating the United States Farmers on USMCA. In 2024; Canada retained Tariffs on various U.S. Goods; particularly in protected sectors like Dairy that are operated under a supply management system. Some examples of Canadian Tariffs on U.S. Dairy outside of the limited quota include: Milk: Up to 243%Butter: Up to 298%Cheese: Up to 245%These sky high Tariffs are part of Canada’s unfair; long-standing policy to shield domestic producers from foreign competition; especially in Agriculture. Our Great U.S. Dairy Farmers deserve fair treatment from Canada. Enjoy it while you can!
0,I am thrilled to announce that Laura Ingraham and Maria Bartiromo will be joining our Kennedy Center Board - This completes our selection. We look forward to restoring the Center to Greatness; and ushering in America’s Golden Age. Together; we will Make the Arts Great Again!
0,I am proud to appoint Michel Issa as our United States Ambassador to Lebanon. Michel is an outstanding businessman; a financial expert; and a leader with a remarkable career in Banking; Entrepreneurship; and International Trade. I have no doubt that he will serve our Country with Honor and Distinction. Congratulations Michel!
0,I am pleased to announce Lynda Blanchard will be the next United States Ambassador for the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in Rome; Italy. During my First Term; Lynda did a great job as U.S. Ambassador to Slovenia. She graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Science from Auburn University and; alongside her husband; she helped build a very successful Real Estate company. I know she will work incredibly hard for our Nation. Congratulations Lynda!
0,I am pleased to announce that Duke Buchan III will serve as the United States Ambassador to the Kingdom of Morocco. Duke will play a pivotal role as we strengthen Peace; Freedom; and Prosperity for both of our Countries. Congratulations to Duke and his wonderful family!
0,I am pleased to announce that Amer Ghalib will be the next United States Ambassador to Kuwait. As the Mayor of the City of Hamtramck; Michigan; Amer worked hard to help us secure a Historic Victory in Michigan. Amer earned his M.D. from the Ross University School of Medicine; and continues to serve his community as a proud healthcare professional. I know he will make our Country proud in this new role. Congratulations Amer!

0,“Trump Administration Cancels $400 Million in Grants to Columbia” https://www.thefp.com/p/exclusive-trump-administration-cancels
0,The head of the United Autoworkers of America just stated that TARIFFS ARE NECESSARY to correct years of abuse of the USA by other countries and companies. We have lost 90;000 factories and plants since the beginning of NAFTA. HE IS 100% CORRECT!!!
0,Based on the fact that Russia is absolutely “pounding” Ukraine on the battlefield right now; I am strongly considering large scale Banking Sanctions; Sanctions; and Tariffs on Russia until a Cease Fire and FINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ON PEACE IS REACHED. To Russia and Ukraine; get to the table right now; before it is too late. Thank you!!!
0,South Africa is being terrible; plus; to long time Farmers in the country. They are confiscating their LAND and FARMS; and MUCH WORSE THAN THAT. A bad place to be right now; and we are stopping all Federal Funding. To go a step further; any Farmer (with family!) from South Africa; seeking to flee that country for reasons of safety; will be invited into the United States of America with a rapid pathway to Citizenship. This process will begin immediately!
0,The Golden Age of America has just begun! Over the past six weeks; our Administration has delivered on promises like no Administration before it; always putting America First! DOGE has been an incredible success; and now that we have my Cabinet in place; I have instructed the Secretaries and Leadership to work with DOGE on Cost Cutting measures and Staffing. As the Secretaries learn about; and understand; the people working for the various Departments; they can be very precise as to who will remain; and who will go. We say the “scalpel” rather than the “hatchet.” The combination of them; Elon; DOGE; and other great people will be able to do things at a historic level.We just had a meeting with most of the Secretaries; Elon; and others; and it was a very positive one. It’s very important that we cut levels down to where they should be; but it’s also important to keep the best and most productive people. We’re going to have these meetings every two weeks until that aspect of this very necessary job is done. The relationships between everybody in that room are extraordinary. They all want to get to the exact same place; which is; simply; to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
0,After speaking with President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico; I have agreed that Mexico will not be required to pay Tariffs on anything that falls under the USMCA Agreement. This Agreement is until April 2nd. I did this as an accommodation; and out of respect for; President Sheinbaum. Our relationship has been a very good one; and we are working hard; together; on the Border; both in terms of stopping Illegal Aliens from entering the United States and; likewise; stopping Fentanyl. Thank you to President Sheinbaum for your hard work and cooperation!
0,Believe it or not; despite the terrible job he’s done for Canada; I think that Justin Trudeau is using the Tariff problem; which he has largely caused; in order to run again for Prime Minister. So much fun to watch!
0,Massive Trade Deficit with the World; just announced; compliments of Sleepy Joe Biden! I will change that!!!
0,The Fake “Play the Ref” News; in order to create a divide between me and our great U.S. Supreme Court; heard me say last night; loudly and openly as I was walking past the Justices on the way to the podium; “thank you;” to Chief Justice John Roberts. Like most people; I don’t watch Fake News CNN or MSDNC; but I understand they are going “crazy” asking what is it that I was thanking Justice Roberts for? They never called my office to ask; of course; but if they had I would have told these sleazebag “journalists” that I thanked him for SWEARING ME IN ON INAUGURATION DAY; AND DOING A REALLY GOOD JOB IN SO DOING! The Fake News never quits!
0,Government funding runs out next week; and Democrats are threatening to shut down the Government - But I am working with the GREAT House Republicans on a Continuing Resolution to fund the Government until September to give us some needed time to work on our Agenda. Conservatives will love this Bill; because it sets us up to cut Taxes and Spending in Reconciliation; all while effectively FREEZING Spending this year; and allowing us to continue our work to; MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. VERY IMPORTANT - Let’s get this Bill done!
0,We have notified the Mayor of Washington; D.C.; that she must clean up all of the unsightly homeless encampments in the City; specifically including the ones outside of the State Department; and near the White House. If she is not capable of doing so; we will be forced to do it for her! Washington; D.C. must become CLEAN and SAFE! We want to be proud of our Great Capital again. Thank you Mayor Bowser for your efforts on behalf of the Citizens of our Country. Hopefully you will be successful!DONALD J. TRUMP; PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
0,The Democrats should lose the Midterms based on their behavior at last night’s Joint Address to Congress. All Republicans must use their behavior on men in women’s sports; their very dangerous Open Border policy; High Energy and Taxes; and much else. Also; Republicans should utilize the footage provided on the total disrespect they showed to all of those that were honored that night; including young ladies who were killed by illegal migrants; people with terminal cancer; etc. They didn’t even have the common courtesy to stand; smile; or applaud. This could be; on analyzing the full tape of this Historic Event; your full CAMPAIGN TO VICTORY! In other words; Republicans can take what happened last night; and win any Race in the Country. Good Luck!!!
0,“Shalom Hamas” means Hello and Goodbye - You can choose. Release all of the Hostages now; not later; and immediately return all of the dead bodies of the people you murdered; or it is OVER for you. Only sick and twisted people keep bodies; and you are sick and twisted! I am sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job; not a single Hamas member will be safe if you don’t do as I say. I have just met with your former Hostages whose lives you have destroyed. This is your last warning! For the leadership; now is the time to leave Gaza; while you still have a chance. Also; to the People of Gaza: A beautiful Future awaits; but not if you hold Hostages. If you do; you are DEAD! Make a SMART decision. RELEASE THE HOSTAGES NOW; OR THERE WILL BE HELL TO PAY LATER!DONALD J. TRUMP; PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
0,For anyone who is interested; I also told Governor Justin Trudeau of Canada that he largely caused the problems we have with them because of his Weak Border Policies; which allowed tremendous amounts of Fentanyl; and Illegal Aliens; to pour into the United States. These Policies are responsible for the death of many people!
0,Justin Trudeau; of Canada; called me to ask what could be done about Tariffs. I told him that many people have died from Fentanyl that came through the Borders of Canada and Mexico; and nothing has convinced me that it has stopped. He said that it’s gotten better; but I said; “That’s not good enough.” The call ended in a “somewhat” friendly manner! He was unable to tell me when the Canadian Election is taking place; which made me curious; like; what’s going on here? I then realized he is trying to use this issue to stay in power. Good luck Justin!

0,Please explain to Governor Trudeau; of Canada; that when he puts on a Retaliatory Tariff on the U.S.; our Reciprocal Tariff will immediately increase by a like amount!
0,IF COMPANIES MOVE TO THE UNITED STATES; THERE ARE NO TARIFFS!!!
0,Canada doesn’t allow American Banks to do business in Canada; but their banks flood the American Market. Oh; that seems fair to me; doesn’t it?

0,All Federal Funding will STOP for any College; School; or University that allows illegal protests. Agitators will be imprisoned/or permanently sent back to the country from which they came. American students will be permanently expelled or; depending on on the crime; arrested. NO MASKS! Thank you for your attention to this matter.
0,Watching our First Lady now; great job! https://www.foxnews.com/politics/melania-trump-speak-first-time-capitol-hill-roundtable-focused-punishing-revenge-porn
0,To the Great Farmers of the United States: Get ready to start making a lot of agricultural product to be sold INSIDE of the United States. Tariffs will go on external product on April 2nd. Have fun!
0,Europe has spent more money buying Russian Oil and Gas than they have spent on defending Ukraine —BY FAR!
0,This is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelenskyy; and America will not put up with it for much longer! It is what I was saying; this guy doesn’t want there to be Peace as long as he has America’s backing and; Europe; in the meeting they had with Zelenskyy; stated flatly that they cannot do the job without the U.S. – Probably not a great statement to have been made in terms of a show of strength against Russia.

0,Exciting news! The Treasury Department has announced that they are suspending all enforcement of the outrageous and invasive Beneficial Ownership Information (BOI) reporting requirement for U.S. Citizens. This Biden rule has been an absolute disaster for Small Businesses Nationwide. Furthermore; Treasury is now finalizing an Emergency Regulation to formally suspend this rule for American businesses. The economic menace of BOI reporting will soon be no more.

0,The month of February; my first full month in Office; had the LOWEST number of Illegal Immigrants trying to enter our Country in History – BY FAR! There were only 8;326 apprehensions of Illegals by Border Patrol at the U.S. - Mexico Border; all of whom were quickly ejected from our Nation or; when necessary; prosecuted for crimes against the United States of America. This means that very few people came – The Invasion of our Country is OVER. In comparison; under Joe Biden; there were 300;000 Illegals crossing in one month; and virtually ALL of them were released into our Country. Thanks to the Trump Administration Policies; the Border is CLOSED to all Illegal Immigrants. Anyone who tries to illegally enter the U.S.A. will face significant criminal penalties and immediate deportation.

Now he is dead; will never experience the thrill of being selected; even though he was a FAR BETTER PLAYER than most of those who made it; and can only be named posthumously. WHAT A SHAME! Anyway; over the next few weeks I will be signing a complete PARDON of Pete Rose; who shouldn’t have been gambling on baseball; but only bet on HIS TEAM WINNING. He never betted against himself; or the other team. He had the most hits; by far; in baseball history; and won more games than anyone in sports history. Baseball; which is dying all over the place; should get off its fat; lazy ass; and elect Pete Rose; even though far too late; into the Baseball Hall of Fame!

0,A Statement from President Donald J. Trump“We had a very meaningful meeting in the White House today. Much was learned that could never be understood without conversation under such fire and pressure. It’s amazing what comes out through emotion; and I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved; because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations. I don’t want advantage; I want PEACE. He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace.”

0,Drugs are still pouring into our Country from Mexico and Canada at  very high and unacceptable levels. A large percentage of these Drugs; much of them in the form of Fentanyl; are made in; and supplied by; China. More than 100;000 people died last year due to the distribution of these dangerous and highly addictive POISONS. Millions of people have died over the last two decades. The families of the victims are devastated and; in many instances; virtually destroyed. We cannot allow this scourge to continue to harm the USA; and therefore; until it stops; or is seriously limited; the proposed TARIFFS scheduled to go into effect on MARCH FOURTH will; indeed; go into effect; as scheduled. China will likewise be charged an additional 10% Tariff on that date. The April Second Reciprocal Tariff date will remain in full force and effect. Thank you for your attention to this matter. GOD BLESS AMERICA!
0,Wayne Gretzky is a fantastic guy! They call him; “The Great One;” and he is. He could run for any political office in Canada; and win.

Wayne and Janet; his wonderful wife; love Canada; and they should only support Canada; and whatever else makes the Canadian People; and Governor Justin Trudeau; happy. He’s the Greatest Canadian of them all; and I am therefore making him a “free agent;” because I don’t want anyone in Canada to say anything bad about him. He supports Canada the way it is; as he should; even though it’s not nearly as good as it could be as part of the Greatest and Most Powerful Country in the World; the Good Ole’ U.S.A.!

Both friend and foe have been treating American Tech Companies harshly; as if our Companies are their piggy bank. This will now end! It is my objective to level the playing field; and end these attacks. We are putting these Countries on notice to end their unfair treatment of American Companies; large and small. Our Companies are the Greatest Investors in the World; and their Investments will only go to where America is treated well. Our Ingenuity; Grit; Drive and Perseverance have built America.

0,Melania and I are looking forward to dinner tonight; at the White House; with our Nation’s Governors; both Republican and Democrat. Maybe this will be the start of UNITY for our Nation. It will be interesting; and fun!!!
0,Remember; LARA TRUMP opens her big new show tonight at 9:00 P.M.; on FoxNews. I may be slightly prejudiced; because Lara is my wonderful daughter-in-law; the wife of my equally wonderful son; Eric; but she really is an amazing person! Remember; she ran; along with Michael Whatley; the Republican National Committee during our great Presidential run of 2024 - SUCH A BIG WIN. She is fantastic — WATCH HER SHOW TONIGHT!!!

0,I want to thank General Charles “CQ” Brown for his over 40 years of service to our country; including as our current Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He is a fine gentleman and an outstanding leader; and I wish a great future for him and his family.  Today; I am honored to announce that I am nominating Air Force Lieutenant General Dan “Razin” Caine to be the next Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. General Caine is an accomplished pilot; national security expert; successful entrepreneur; and a “warfighter” with significant interagency and special operations experience. During my first term; Razin was instrumental in the complete annihilation of the ISIS caliphate. It was done in record setting time; a matter of weeks. Many so-called military “geniuses” said it would take years to defeat ISIS. General Caine; on the other hand; said it could be done quickly; and he delivered. Despite being highly qualified and respected to serve on the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the previous administration; General Caine was passed over for promotion by Sleepy Joe Biden. But not anymore! Alongside Secretary Pete Hegseth; General Caine and our military will restore peace through strength; put America First; and rebuild our military. Finally; I have also directed Secretary Hegseth to solicit nominations for five additional high level positions; which will be announced soon. Thank you for your attention to this matter!

Meshawn will be fantastic for the MAGA Movement; and I look forward to working with her to Make Michigan; and America; Great Again. Meshawn Maddock has my Complete and Total Endorsement – SHE WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN!
0,I am hearing that Highly Respected Congressman Byron Donalds is considering running for Governor of Florida; a State that I love; and WON BIG in 2016; 2020; and 2024. I know Byron well; have seen him tested at the highest and most difficult levels; and he is a TOTAL WINNER! Byron has a great wife; Erika; and three beautiful sons. They are very proud of him! As Governor; Byron would have a BIG Voice; and would work closely with me to advance our America First Agenda. He will fight tirelessly to Secure our Border; Stop Migrant Crime; Strengthen our Military; Protect our Vets; Restore our Economic Power; Advance American Energy DOMINANCE; and Defend our always under siege Second Amendment. Byron Donalds would be a truly Great and Powerful Governor for Florida and; should he decide to run; will have my Complete and Total Endorsement. RUN; BYRON; RUN!
0,Thank you to Majority Leader John Thune; and the Republican Senate; for working so hard on funding the Trump Border Agenda. We are setting records; the likes of which have never been seen before; on stopping criminal illegals aliens from entering our Country. Put simply; we are delivering for the American People; far faster and; more successfully; than anyone thought possible. Your work on funding this effort is greatly appreciated!

0,Think of it; a modestly successful comedian; Volodymyr Zelenskyy; talked the United States of America into spending $350 Billion Dollars; to go into a War that couldn’t be won; that never had to start; but a War that he; without the U.S. and “TRUMP;” will never be able to settle. The United States has spent $200 Billion Dollars more than Europe; and Europe’s money is guaranteed; while the United States will get nothing back. Why didn’t Sleepy Joe Biden demand Equalization; in that this War is far more important to Europe than it is to us — We have a big; beautiful Ocean as separation. On top of this; Zelenskyy admits that half of the money we sent him is “MISSING.” He refuses to have Elections; is very low in Ukrainian Polls; and the only thing he was good at was playing Biden “like a fiddle.” A Dictator without Elections; Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left. In the meantime; we are successfully negotiating an end to the War with Russia; something all admit only “TRUMP;” and the Trump Administration; can do. Biden never tried; Europe has failed to bring Peace; and Zelenskyy probably wants to keep the “gravy train” going. I love Ukraine; but Zelenskyy has done a terrible job; his Country is shattered; and MILLIONS have unnecessarily died – And so it continues…..
0,The House and Senate are doing a SPECTACULAR job of working together as one unified; and unbeatable; TEAM; however; unlike the Lindsey Graham version of the very important Legislation currently being discussed; the House Resolution implements my FULL America First Agenda; EVERYTHING; not just parts of it! We need both Chambers to pass the House Budget to “kickstart” the Reconciliation process; and move all of our priorities to the concept of; “ONE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL.” It will; without question; MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

0,On Trade; I have decided; for purposes of Fairness; that I will charge a RECIPROCAL Tariff meaning; whatever Countries charge the United States of America; we will charge them - No more; no less!For purposes of this United States Policy; we will consider Countries that use the VAT System; which is far more punitive than a Tariff; to be similar to that of a Tariff. Sending merchandise; product; or anything by any other name through another Country; for purposes of unfairly harming America; will not be accepted. In addition; we will make provision for subsidies provided by Countries in order to take Economic advantage of the United States. Likewise; provisions will be made for Nonmonetary Tariffs and Trade Barriers that some Countries charge in order to keep our product out of their domain or; if they do not even let U.S. businesses operate. We are able to accurately determine the cost of these Nonmonetary Trade Barriers. It is fair to all; no other Country can complain and; in some cases; if a Country feels that the United States would be getting too high a Tariff; all they have to do is reduce or terminate their Tariff against us. There are no Tariffs if you manufacture or build your product in the United States.For many years; the U.S. has been treated unfairly by other Countries; both friend and foe. This System will immediately bring Fairness and Prosperity back into the previously complex and unfair System of Trade. America has helped many Countries throughout the years; at great financial cost. It is now time that these Countries remember this; and treat us fairly – A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD FOR AMERICAN WORKERS. I have instructed my Secretary of State; Secretary of Commerce; Secretary of the Treasury; and United States Trade Representative (USTR) to do all work necessary to deliver RECIPROCITY to our System of Trade!

0,President Donald J. Trump was just unanimously elected Chairman of the Board of the prestigious Kennedy Center in Washington; D.C. The President stated; “It is a Great Honor to be Chairman of The Kennedy Center; especially with this amazing Board of Trustees. We will make The Kennedy Center a very special and exciting place!”
0,I just spoke to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine. The conversation went very well. He; like President Putin; wants to make PEACE. We discussed a variety of topics having to do with the War; but mostly; the meeting that is being set up on Friday in Munich; where Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio will lead the Delegation. I am hopeful that the results of that meeting will be positive. It is time to stop this ridiculous War; where there has been massive; and totally unnecessary; DEATH and DESTRUCTION. God bless the people of Russia and Ukraine!
0,I just had a lengthy and highly productive phone call with President Vladimir Putin of Russia. We discussed Ukraine; the Middle East; Energy; Artificial Intelligence; the power of the Dollar; and various other subjects. We both reflected on the Great History of our Nations; and the fact that we fought so successfully together in World War II; remembering; that Russia lost tens of millions of people; and we; likewise; lost so many! We each talked about the strengths of our respective Nations; and the great benefit that we will someday have in working together. But first; as we both agreed; we want to stop the millions of deaths taking place in the War with Russia/Ukraine. President Putin even used my very strong Campaign motto of; “COMMON SENSE.” We both believe very strongly in it. We agreed to work together; very closely; including visiting each other’s Nations. We have also agreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately; and we will begin by calling President Zelenskyy; of Ukraine; to inform him of the conversation; something which I will be doing right now. I have asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio; Director of the CIA John Ratcliffe; National Security Advisor Michael Waltz; and Ambassador and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff; to lead the negotiations which; I feel strongly; will be successful. Millions of people have died in a War that would not have happened if I were President; but it did happen; so it must end. No more lives should be lost! I want to thank President Putin for his time and effort with respect to this call; and for the release; yesterday; of Marc Fogel; a wonderful man that I personally greeted last night at the White House. I believe this effort will lead to a successful conclusion; hopefully soon!
0,BIDEN INFLATION UP!
0,DOGE has found massive amounts of FRAUD; WASTE; INCOMPETENCE; AND ABUSE; but even knowing this; a highly political; activist Judge wants us to immediately make payment; anyway. In other words pay; even though you know the payment was fraudulently requested to be made. DOGE caught them - The Judge just doesn’t care. It doesn’t make sense!!!

0,Canada has agreed to ensure we have a secure Northern Border; and to finally end the deadly scourge of drugs like Fentanyl that have been pouring into our Country; killing hundreds of thousands of Americans; while destroying their families and communities all across our Country.Canada will implement their $1.3 Billion Border plan; and as per Prime Minister Trudeau; will be; “reinforcing the Border with new choppers; technology and personnel; enhanced coordination with our American partners; and increased resources to stop the flow of fentanyl. Nearly 10;000 frontline personnel are; and will be; working on protecting the Border. In addition; Canada is making new commitments to appoint a Fentanyl Czar; we will list cartels as terrorists; ensure 24/7 eyes on the Border; launch a Canada-U.S. Joint Strike Force to combat organized crime; fentanyl and money laundering. I have also signed a new intelligence directive on organized crime and fentanyl; and we will be backing it with $200 million.”As President; it is my responsibility to ensure the safety of ALL Americans; and I am doing just that. I am very pleased with this initial outcome; and the Tariffs announced on Saturday will be paused for a 30 day period to see whether or not a final Economic deal with Canada can be structured. FAIRNESS FOR ALL!
0,I just spoke with President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico. It was a very friendly conversation wherein she agreed to immediately supply 10;000 Mexican Soldiers on the Border separating Mexico and the United States. These soldiers will be specifically designated to stop the flow of fentanyl; and illegal migrants into our Country. We further agreed to immediately pause the anticipated tariffs for a one month period during which we will have negotiations headed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio; Secretary of Treasury Scott Bessent; and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick; and high-level Representatives of Mexico. I look forward to participating in those negotiations; with President Sheinbaum; as we attempt to achieve a “deal” between our two Countries.

0,We pay hundreds of Billions of Dollars to SUBSIDIZE Canada. Why? There is no reason. We don’t need anything they have. We have unlimited Energy; should make our own Cars; and have more Lumber than we can ever use. Without this massive subsidy; Canada ceases to exist as a viable Country. Harsh but true! Therefore; Canada should become our Cherished 51st State. Much lower taxes; and far better military protection for the people of Canada — AND NO TARIFFS!

THOSE DAYS ARE OVER! The USA has major deficits with Canada; Mexico; and China (and almost all countries!); owes 36 Trillion Dollars; and we’re not going to be the “Stupid Country” any longer. MAKE YOUR PRODUCT IN THE USA AND THERE ARE NO TARIFFS! Why should the United States lose TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN SUBSIDIZING OTHER COUNTRIES; and why should these other countries pay a small fraction of the cost of what USA citizens pay for Drugs and Pharmaceuticals; as an example? THIS WILL BE THE GOLDEN AGE OF AMERICA! WILL THERE BE SOME PAIN? YES; MAYBE (AND MAYBE NOT!). BUT WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN; AND IT WILL ALL BE WORTH THE PRICE THAT MUST BE PAID.

0,TARIFFS!
0,Today; I have implemented a 25% Tariff on Imports from Mexico and Canada (10% on Canadian Energy); and a 10% additional Tariff on China. This was done through the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) because of the major threat of illegal aliens and deadly drugs killing our Citizens; including fentanyl. We need to protect Americans; and it is my duty as President to ensure the safety of all. I made a promise on my Campaign to stop the flood of illegal aliens and drugs from pouring across our Borders; and Americans overwhelmingly voted in favor of it.
0,This morning I ordered precision Military air strikes on the Senior ISIS Attack Planner and other terrorists he recruited and led in Somalia. These killers; who we found hiding in caves; threatened the United States and our Allies. The strikes destroyed the caves they live in; and killed many terrorists without; in any way; harming civilians. Our Military has targeted this ISIS Attack Planner for years; but Biden and his cronies wouldn’t act quickly enough to get the job done. I did! The message to ISIS and all others who would attack Americans is that “WE WILL FIND YOU; AND WE WILL KILL YOU!”
0,It is so good to have the Venezuela Hostages back home and; very important to note; that Venezuela has agreed to receive; back into their Country; all Venezuela illegal aliens who were encamped in the U.S.; including gang members of Tren de Aragua.

We are in the process of removing record numbers of illegal aliens from all Countries; and all Countries have agreed to accept these illegal aliens back. Furthermore; record numbers of criminals are being removed from our Country; and the Border numbers are the strongest they have been since the First Term of the Trump Administration!

The Fed has done a terrible job on Bank Regulation. Treasury is going to lead the effort to cut unnecessary Regulation; and will unleash lending for all American people and businesses. If the Fed had spent less time on DEI; gender ideology; “green” energy; and fake climate change; Inflation would never have been a problem. Instead; we suffered from the worst Inflation in the History of our Country!
0,It is great to see that the Department of Justice has dropped the Witch Hunt against former Congressman Jeff Fortenberry; a longtime proud and highly respected American public servant. Jeff and his family were forced to suffer greatly due to the illegal Weaponization of our Justice System by the Radical Left Democrats. Jeff’s “case” was originally overturned by the Ninth Circuit; but the “persecutors” would not leave it alone and; shockingly;  indicted him again in Washington; D.C. The charges were totally baseless. That Scam is now over; so Jeff and his family can go back to having a great life together; and be a part of our Country’s future as we MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. I am very proud of our Department of Justice; something I have not been able to say for many years!

This order was given by Colombia’s Socialist President Gustavo Petro; who is already very unpopular amongst his people. Petro’s denial of these flights has jeopardized the National Security and Public Safety of the United States; so I have directed my Administration to immediately take the following urgent and decisive retaliatory measures: -Emergency 25% tariffs on all goods coming into the United States. In one week; the 25% tariffs will be raised to 50%.-A Travel Ban and immediate Visa Revocations on the Colombian Government Officials; and all Allies and Supporters.-Visa Sanctions on all Party Members; Family Members; and Supporters of the Colombian Government. -Enhanced Customs and Border Protection Inspections of all Colombian Nationals and Cargo on national security grounds.-IEEPA Treasury; Banking and Financial Sanctions to be fully imposed.  These measures are just the beginning. We will not allow the Colombian Government to violate its legal obligations with regard to the acceptance and return of the Criminals they forced into the United States!

0,A special thank you to great New Jersey Congressman Jeff Van Drew for his fight against a large scale Windmill DISASTER off the coast of Southern New Jersey. It needed MASSIVE GOVERNMENT SUBSIDY that was impossible to justify. Hopefully the project is dead and gone; as almost all unsightly and environmentally unsound Windmill project should be. Congratulations to the great people of New Jersey. You have FINALLY won your war on stupidity!!!

0,I’m not looking to hurt Russia. I love the Russian people; and always had a very good relationship with President Putin - and this despite the Radical Left’s Russia; Russia; Russia HOAX. We must never forget that Russia helped us win the Second World War; losing almost 60;000;000 lives in the process. All of that being said; I’m going to do Russia; whose Economy is failing; and President Putin; a very big FAVOR. Settle now; and STOP this ridiculous War! IT’S ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE. If we don’t make a “deal;” and soon; I have no other choice but to put high levels of Taxes; Tariffs; and Sanctions on anything being sold by Russia to the United States; and various other participating countries. Let’s get this war; which never would have started if I were President; over with! We can do it the easy way; or the hard way - and the easy way is always better. It’s time to “MAKE A DEAL.” NO MORE LIVES SHOULD BE LOST!!!

0,The so-called Bishop who spoke at the National Prayer Service on Tuesday morning was a Radical Left hard line Trump hater. She brought her church into the World of politics in a very ungracious way. She was nasty in tone; and not compelling or smart. She failed to mention the large number of illegal migrants that came into our Country and killed people. Many were deposited from jails and mental institutions. It is a giant crime wave that is taking place in the USA. Apart from her inappropriate statements; the service was a very boring and uninspiring one. She is not very good at her job! She and her church owe the public an apology! t
0,I just called the mother of Ross William Ulbricht to let her know that in honor of her and the Libertarian Movement; which supported me so strongly; it was my pleasure to have just signed a full and unconditional pardon of her son; Ross. The scum that worked to convict him were some of the same lunatics who were involved in the modern day weaponization of government against me. He was given two life sentences; plus 40 years. Ridiculous!

0,I’m asking companies not to let TikTok stay dark! I will issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before the law’s prohibitions take effect; so that we can make a deal to protect our national security. The order will also confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order. Americans deserve to see our exciting Inauguration on Monday; as well as other events and conversations. I would like the United States to have a 50% ownership position in a joint venture.  By doing this; we save TikTok; keep it in good hands and allow it to say up.  Without U.S. approval; there is no Tik Tok.  With our approval; it is worth hundreds of billions of dollars - maybe trillions.  Therefore; my initial thought is a joint venture between the current owners and/or new owners whereby the U.S. gets a 50% ownership in a joint venture set up between the U.S. and whichever purchase we so choose.
