1,High res video of landing from the helo https://t.co/G0Yq2V5J3m
1,@Jon_Favreau Thanks Jon!
1,11 satellites deployed to target orbit and Falcon has landed back at Cape Canaveral. Headed to LZ-1. Welcome back; baby!
1,Launch &amp; landing can be seen on the https://t.co/bDd3GxQXMC webcast or in person from Cape Canaveral public causeway at 8:33pm local tmrw
1,Currently looking good for a Sunday night (~8pm local) attempted orbital launch and rocket landing at Cape Canaveral
1,Abort triggered by flight computer on upper stage throttle valve. Adjusting thresholds and restarting count at T-10 mins.
1,@mashabletech @mashable Not really my letter (no authorship contribution). Just agreed to add my name when they asked.
1,Good summary of my talk in Paris on climate change https://t.co/n27JiXUsW9
1,About to give a talk at the Sorbonne https://t.co/j7iVq1GycH
1,@ID_AA_Carmack Yep; good points. I hope you get back into space some day!
1,"It is; however; important to clear up the difference between ""space"" and ""orbit""; as described well by https://t.co/7PD42m37fZ"
1,@kevinmitnick Current production is LTE. Can be upgraded by service.
1,@jonthomason yay! Always happy to make others happy
1,@thebradholt big UI update coming in V7.1
1,Autopilot release to Europe and Asia pending regulatory approval. Hopefully get the ok in the next few weeks.
1,@Meddd__ @aaronpaul_8 Watched the whole series. One of the best tv shows ever.
1,@aaronpaul_8 sure :)
1,@aikisteve @andrewshiamone V7.1
1,Some exciting news this week: Tesla Version 7 software with Autopilot goes to wide release on Thursday!
1,Peak temp increases due to climate change http://t.co/dThGhXd6MT
1,@sasatokic @mashable Front doors have a short arc and their interior panels are chamfered back
1,@johnzabroski thanks; that's a great idea. I think we can do that.
1,In expendable mode; Falcon Heavy can send a fully loaded Dragon to Mars or a light Dragon to Jupiter's moons. Europa mission wd be cool.
1,New model for evolution of intelligent life suggests probable emergence 2 billion years ago near galactic center http://t.co/8OUAOiiblh
1,The car will learn over time; but there is a min caliber of starting quality.
1,@ID_AA_Carmack Even if inevitable; we should at least attempt to postpone the advent of AI weaponry. Sooner isn't better.
1,If you’re against a military AI arms race; please sign this open letter:  http://t.co/yyF9rcm9jz
1,Model S product call at 11 today. Rocket discussion at noon on Monday.
1,@DavidBrin Thanks David
1,Falcon 9 experienced a problem shortly before first stage shutdown. Will provide more info as soon as we review the data.
1,@ChristieNic Thanks Christie
1,My favorite shot from the last rocket landing attempt on the droneship http://t.co/8a403c7Fv1
1,Rocket launch good; satellite in geo transfer orbit. Still so damn intense. Looking fwd to it feeling normal one day.
1,@andrewket @TeslaRoadTrip Wow!
1,Droneship is fine. No hull breach and repairs are minor. Impact overpressure is closer to a fast fire than an explosion.
1,If this works; I'm treating myself to a volcano lair. It's time.
1,Ok; looks like we got some killer footage from the chase plane. Big ocean; small ship. Posting vid shortly http://t.co/2F5FK0TZ0i
1,Ascent successful. Dragon enroute to Space Station. Rocket landed on droneship; but too hard for survival.
1,Have asked SolarCity if we can do something philanthropic with the CA aqueducts to help the water crisis. Investigating…
1,"Battery ""breakthroughs"" need to state power *and* energy density (not the same thing); plus how long they last. They usually fail on energy."
1,Welcome @Chiefboltkennyh to @TeslaMotors. He will apply Formula 1 techniques to revolutionize servicing mainstream cars.
1,"@johngreen @hankgreen You had me at Sheen or Gaddafi. Must admit to liking ""The Fault in Our Stars"" too. Sad; romantic and beautifully named"
1,SolarCity just hit a new daily energy record of 5GWh two weeks after reaching 4GWh
1,Flying car pros: travel in 3D fast. Cons: risk of car falling on head much greater; noisy; grounded in bad weather
1,Reading Look to Windward by Banks. He is an amazing writer. Pantheon level.
1,@Pandoomic Just changed them to full public domain
1,However; when self-driving cars become safer than human-driven cars; the public may outlaw the latter. Hopefully not.
1,The ancient Egyptians were amazing; but if aliens built the pyramids; they would've left behind a computer or something
1,The rumor that I'm building a spaceship to get back to my home planet Mars is totally untrue
1,"Seems like an opportune moment to bring up the Fermi Paradox; aka ""where are the aliens?"" Really odd that we see no sign of them."
1,Model S in drag race against snowmobile on ice lake in Norway (no tire chains or studs) http://t.co/OWwfGRQC8p
1,There is no slowdown of the Gigafactory construction underway; as anyone near Reno with eyes can verify. It's not subtle.
1,Landing on a stormy sea http://t.co/7EY25g3IU5
1,Rocket soft landed in the ocean within 10m of target &amp; nicely vertical! High probability of good droneship landing in non-stormy weather.
1,Primary mission on target. Spacecraft head towards the sun! All good there.
1,Can't delay any longer. Must proceed with primary mission to launch the Deep Space Climate Observatory spacecraft.
1,Dragon splashdown off the California coast http://t.co/4Bvfmei8I3
1,Launch postponed to tomorrow due to high winds at the Cape; but Dragon still inbound from orbit in 90 mins
1,Air Force tracking radar went down. Launch postponed to same time tomorrow.
1,Launching our 1st deep space mission today. Headed to Earth-Sun L1 gravity null point at 1M miles; 4X further than moon.
1,If you are curious about the P85D; you can schedule a test drive here: http://t.co/Eu19pBUpNO
1,P85 acceleration will also improve; but not quite as much
1,Ion thrusters are great; but have extremely tiny force (photon thruster even less). Must have more thrust than weight or you don't go up.
1,"Reason is Newton's Third Law. In vacuum; there is nothing to ""push"" against. You must react against ejected mass."
1,If u saw @TheSimpsons and wonder why @SpaceX doesn't use an electric rocket to reach orbit; it is cuz that is impossible
1,"West Coast droneship under construction will be named ""Of Course I Still Love You"""
1,Good primer on the exponential advancement of technology; particularly AI http://t.co/1c30ZwJ8Y5
1,@thomasmuirhead Good piece
1,Next rocket landing on drone ship in 2 to 3 weeks w way more hydraulic fluid. At least it shd explode for a diff reason.
1,@ID_AA_Carmack Rocket hits hard at ~45 deg angle; smashing legs and engine section http://t.co/PnzHHluJfG
1,Upcoming flight already has 50% more hydraulic fluid; so should have plenty of margin for landing attempt next month.
1,Grid fins worked extremely well from hypersonic velocity to subsonic; but ran out of hydraulic fluid right before landing.
1,Launching in one minute
1,Btw; we are actually working on a charger that automatically moves out from the wall &amp; connects like a solid metal snake. For realz.
1,Model S range curves in detail by version http://t.co/DGIKGTIagW
1,Roadster upgrade details http://t.co/9RZVMCJeMJ
1,I'd recommend competing for the $10M Learning XPRIZE. Illiteracy is the wellspring of poverty. http://t.co/NLuFheVmpx
1,@John_Gardi Using legs as air brakes to drop terminal velocity in half requires slight redesign &amp; more data. Maybe flight 21.

1,Long exposure of AsiaSat 6 transiting to geo orbit over China http://t.co/mPr2Td9kkx
1,Launch in ~1.5 hours if weather clears. Lightning tower struck earlier; but no effect on rocket or satellite http://t.co/AWdx9LsFZt
1,Model S limits torque if brake &amp; accel simul pressed. Going to zero torque with brake press would be a safety hazard.
1,@WillOremus That has been my goal from the beginning. Need the Gigafactory for Model 3.
1,Three engine F9R Dev1 vehicle auto-terminated during test flight. No injuries or near injuries. Rockets are tricky …
1,@awadsayeed Yes. Technically Model 3 or maybe three horizontal bars. Won't be three vertical bars.
1,@BillGates @RyanSeacrest @TEDchris Am a bit under the weather; but will do it!
1,Looks like body slam; maybe from a self-generated wave
1,Flight 10 of Falcon 9 was good. All six ORBCOMM satellites deployed on target.

1,Recording of Dragon V2 unveil at http://t.co/aBIV4EWOS2
1,@QuantumG When we launch I want to know that SpaceX has done everything possible to keep the astronauts safe. Only a few more years to go.
1,Either way; this case certainly deserves close examination by the DoD Inspector General per @SenJohnMcCain's request http://t.co/IZ4JO2y3JO
1,@Oatmeal may all technology in the future follow the zeroth law...
1,@Oatmeal I would be happy to help
1,Sounds like this might be a good time to unveil the new Dragon Mk 2 spaceship that @SpaceX has been working on w @NASA. No trampoline needed
1,@MarinaSBlinova Rocket boost stage reaching 0 m/s in one piece :) Will know soon. Odds not high.
1,Hexacopter drone vid of 1st F9 rocket booster takeoff &amp; landing w flight design legs http://t.co/FhZX3afK1a
1,Launch to the Space Station in just under three hours if weather holds http://t.co/aBIV4EWOS2
1,@elonmusk Also; breakfast at Tesla is self-serve cereal (no distinction for execs) and the person mentioned isn't actually an employee
1,Tesla US business leasing program went live today http://t.co/wCH0GLAEAJ
1,@AKAbrahamson @itsDanielSuarez Yeah; that's worth a read
1,Bloomberg article today also has oddly false details. I don't eat breakfast at Tesla and drink coffee; not juice.
1,@cairnz 80% to 30%
1,@FlateFred agreed
1,@jnags92 Yes; I'm confident that Tesla will do something with them.
1,@TeslaRoadTrip Thanks; I really appreciate your support!
1,Tesla policy is to charge the same price (+ taxes &amp; shipping) everywhere in the world http://t.co/cXOtokcBeG
1,@bonnienorman @TeslaMotors @TeslaMotorsClub Merry Christmas!
1,@TierraUniversu Doesn't sound right. If it is; we certainly need to fix it. Investigating...
1,@WilliamShatner Will do. Probably at least a few days. Depends on whether we need to pull the turbopumps.
1,Tesla is also extending the Model S warranty to cover any fire damage even if due solely to a driver accident
1,Will do another static fire of rocket to make sure all is good &amp; AF needs to test ICBMs; so probable launch Sept 29/30.
1,It is crazy that the proposed California high speed rail only goes 200 mph w avg speed of 130 mph when Japan is 300 mph+
1,Was at Vandenberg today going over the upcoming next gen F9 rocket launch. Some tense days ahead http://t.co/bfXnFt7alm

1,Pulled all nighter working on Hyperloop (as did others). Hopefully not too many mistakes. Will publish link at 1:30 PDT.
1,"Best saying ever “@temochdez: there is a saying in Mexico: ""El miedo no anda en burro"" meaning ""Fear doesn't ride on a donkey""”"
1,Will publish Hyperloop alpha design by Aug 12. Critical feedback for improvements would be much appreciated.
1,Just completed full mission duration firing of next gen Falcon 9 booster. V proud of the boost stage team for overcoming many tough issues.
1,UDP (yeah you know me) 3X
1,Woohoo; Tesla direct sales petition passed the 100k threshold! Thanks a lot to everyone that helped!!
1,@lougil_ace Taking action. Will be a 7 day grace period for $2500 ext warranty. Neg margin at that price; so must unfortunately raise.
1,@arthurblake Turning recirc off; windows closed and the right film on rear glass usually works. Am asking HVAC engineering to investigate.
1,Battery pack swap works with all Tesla Model S cars; past and present. It was always there.
1,@zatulsky Shai actually got the idea from a visit to Tesla. The idea is obvious (many things allow battery swap); but the technology is not.
1,1st long duration firing of the new generation Falcon 9 rocket ~1.5 million pounds of vac thrust http://t.co/iGZadNVF7w
1,@SQMInc I don't have a publicist
1,Huge expansion of Tesla Supercharger network underway. Will cover LA to NY by end of year http://t.co/MFKjBJzklc
1,Was beat up pretty badly as a kid &amp; left me w jagged septum. Harder to breathe as I got older; so time to fix.
1,@VarunG_ Belief in climate change isn't necessary. Even a small probability of a severe outcome justifies a carbon tax.
1,@karlbrauer Making rockets

1,There is a way for the Tesla Model S to be recharged throughout the country faster than you could fill a gas tank.
1,@mjasandoval Stay tuned
1,Tesla priority is electrification of cars; so priority is Model S; Model X; then mass market third gen vehicle &amp; truck

1,@ChrisCowan_  Chris is great. Took a long time for me to find someone w truly hardcore engineering skills; who fully understood the system.
1,Tesla raises Model S resale value guarantee to highest in auto industry http://t.co/l5LOXtyP33
1,@2552nsf Yeah; that is super tricky. Will have to sacrifice a lot of payload to boost back or land on ocean platform.
1,@realbhuwan @teslamotors Cool :)
1,Auto Dealer Sterling McCall makes the case for Tesla direct sales in Texas http://t.co/JcHETe0d2l

1,Slight change of date to ensure no end of quarter distractions -- will be Tues next week.
1,But when considering savings of gas v electricity; true cost vs gas cars is more like $25k for a v sweet ride
1,.@joshj777 It has always been my dream to produce a low cost; compelling electric car. We are 3 to 4 years away. Wish it could be sooner.

1,@DimaZeniuk So much has happened in 15 years
1,@DrKnowItAll16 The Starlink V3 WiFi router is *much* better. Please lmk if you notice the difference.  We are also super focused on getting latency below 20ms if the user terminal and ground gateway can both be seen by a single satellite.  P50 ping&lt;30ms is definitely achievable.
1,@MiddleearthMixr I heartily agree! Seeing all those ugly QR codes makes my eyes bleed.
1,@pmarca @CJHandmer It is rather tragic to see an otherwise capable comedian like @iamjohnoliver become weak sauce.  The reason he is not very funny these days is because he is too keen to pander to wokeness; which is fundamentally a lie; whereas great humor requires revealed truth.
1,@shaunmmaguire @sequoia The X investment will turn out well
1,@alx Lmao; we just hit all-time record usage

1,@MuskUniversity Important to note that what happens on Earth’s surface (eg farming) has no meaningful impact on climate change.   Overwhelmingly; the risk of climate change is due to moving billions of tons of carbon from deep underground into the atmosphere.  Over time; if we keep doing this;

1,@tim_zaman Exactly
1,@teslaownersSV I should clarify that Dojo V1 is highly optimized for vast amounts of video training vs general purpose AI. Dojo V2 will address these limitations.
1,@MuskUniversity 💯was just thinking that again today
1,@TheBabylonBee Feels that way
1,@RandPaul Some accounting of how American taxpayer money is being spent sure sounds like a reasonable request!
1,@SarahisCensored Etymology ftw
1,@darewecan @imPenny2x That’s my best guess
1,@imPenny2x Not exactly a competitor to Nvidia; as we aren’t selling Dojo computers (although it could be sold as service).   We just need a crazy amount of training compute to get full self-driving 10X safer than human; but can’t get enough GPUs; plus prices are extremely high!
1,@ggreenwald @FT This is probably accurate.
1,@SenSchumer Definitely
1,@Jason This is not to say that reporters in most western countries are simply coin-operated – they will defend their “independence” to the death; as acknowledging it at all would diminish their credibility.  But it is also false/foolish to suggest that there is no influence.
1,@Jason They claim to have a “wall” between news &amp; advertising; but reporters know full well who butters their bread.   For example; there were nonstop bogus articles about electric cars on fire; even though they’re 500% to 1000% less likely to burn than combustion engine cars.   As soon

1,@bennyjohnson Seems to be happening in more &amp; more cities

1,@WhatsupFranks @chhardman @PeterHotez @joerogan That would be interesting indeed
1,@chhardman @PeterHotez @joerogan But it was a mistake to push for so many Covid-19 booster shots (even the initial vaccine shot was overkill on quantity).  There‘s obviously risk of the immune system going out of control when it sees what what you’ve trained it to believe is a serious disease over &amp; over again.
1,@chhardman @PeterHotez @joerogan Accurate summary. Look; I’m prepared to argue in favor of vaccines if you’d like.  Do I think vaccines should be examined closely &amp; mortality risk isn’t substantially reduced in America? Yes.   However; you should definitely take vaccines if traveling to places where that disease
1,@mcjamez I bought it anyway. Didn’t actually expect it to work like the video.   But this is news that there is a drone – albeit expensive – that actually works!

1,@farzyness To be frank; we’re lucky to have modern medicine. I’d be dead from malaria if not for chloroquine &amp; doxycycline.  But; we should still question medicine; rather than considering it sacred. The entire foundation of science is to question it; thereby coming closer to the truth.
1,@growing_daniel Still the most effective breath mint afaik
1,@TheRabbitHole84 @joerogan There is an argument that the negatives of SSRIs outweigh the positives
1,@GilliRoth @PeterHotez Exactly. Two of my kids are on the spectrum and they got it from me; not vaccines. It was obvious from when they were babies; but thankfully improved to some degree over time.
1,@PeterHotez First of all; I am generally pro vaccine. I have been vaccinated against pretty much everything; as have my kids.  Second; I think there is tremendous promise in synthetic mRNA. It is like medicine going from analog to digital.  That said; the world obviously went crazy with https://t.co/lQkqY8uvgT

1,@PeterHotez @annamerlan So you’re saying you endorse Vice? https://t.co/bX3ZY5fgRh
1,@joerogan Maybe @PeterHotez just hates charity 🤷‍♂️
1,@hannahrosewoods Magic 🪄 sword 🗡️
1,@AskTheWassie Promotion of scams under the guise of being a funny/helpful bot will result in suspension. Doesn’t matter how much you pay us.
1,@KanekoaTheGreat Just coincidence
1,Oh hi lol https://t.co/pLxkLDu0Qs
1,@ExplainThisBob This sure looks like a scam crypto account. If so; it will be suspended.
1,@PeterHotez @annamerlan Wait; Vice is still alive!?
1,@farzyness Envy idea?   I have a little envy tbh
1,@joerogan This platform is the PvP of social media. Other sites are like a baby with a pacifier.
1,@KonstantinKisin Humans love being in cults!
1,@RavenThePlayer @Jason Abuse of the spam feature would result in the reporting account being suspended
1,@Jason Good idea. We will implement.
1,@joerogan He’s afraid of a public debate; because he knows he’s wrong
1,@mysteriouskat If everyone stopped eating red meat; the result would be genocide of the cow nation!   I’m in favor kind treatment of farm animals; but not their destruction.
1,@mysteriouskat The opposite of a sequitur
1,@PeterDiamandis As measured by the first writing; civilization has exited for only 1 millionth of Earth’s existence  https://t.co/SMHYvKN2sd
1,Accounts that try to game our verification system with non-sequitur self-promotion or advertise in a misleading way will be suspended
1,@WhalesGuru Spamming replies with non-sequitur self-promotion will result in account suspension

1,@teslaownersSV All too true
1,@teslaownersSV We built the Supercharger network out of desperation; since no one else was doing it
1,@CualquieraOnvre @TuckerCarlson Thanks for doing translation. We’re working on providing translation of all videos to any language.
1,@simongerman600 Could’ve been used to carry messages in the old days
1,Once again; I’d like to offer this platform to anyone on the left. You will get equal treatment.

1,@aaronsibarium Great thread on how ESG is used as a moral cloak to hide bad behavior.  Any cause that makes makes it’s virtue unquestionable will immediately be adopted by the unvirtuous.
1,@BillyM2k @KingSatine @WSBChairman call them “wacktivists” they will love it
1,@Teslaconomics It’s practically invisible
1,@SOFMovie2023 I recommend putting it on this platform for free for a brief period or just asking people to subscribe to support (we would not keep any funds)
1,@WholeMarsBlog Interesting; given that OpenAI has no authorized X/Twitter feed
1,@wintonARK No-brainer
1,@GailAlfarATX Exactly
1,@alx If Apple competes against the whole world; Apple will have the whole world against it. This is not a winning scenario.

1,@petergyang Good idea; will do
1,@FlynnVIN10 @pmarca Good question.   We are already cyborgs. Our memory is overwhelmingly outsourced to computers – they remember everything with extreme precision down to the pixel.   Our thinking is much less outsourced; as there are still many things we can do that AI cannot. For now.
1,@pmarca Any downsides?
1,@krassenstein @WSJ @AlexanderSoros Maybe we should do a Spaces with you; me &amp; Alex to air this out
1,@WSJ If @AlexanderSoros is serious about freedom of speech; then we have common ground.  But destroying public safety by electing DAs who won’t prosecute violent criminals needs to stop.
1,@WallStreetSilv Good point
1,@alx Just a formality. Alex has been de facto in charge for several years.
1,@StephenKing There is also equal treatment before the law. Differential prosecution undermines public faith in the justice system.

1,@shellenberger Haven’t seen anything &amp; I think I’d know

1,@realDailyWire I’m tempted to say that this will drive viewership of your movie; but … no one watches CNN lol
1,@ZubyMusic Thanks :)
1,@realDailyWire @MattWalshBlog World Champion Streisand Effect
1,@TitterDaily What are they talking about?
1,@damonimani Not me or X/Twitter. Others are paying to promote it.
1,Let that sink in
1,@teslaownersSV Game changer
1,@zerohedge If only someone had warned us …
1,@RobertKennedyJr @instagram Would you like to do a Spaces discussion with me next week?
1,@theLGBgroup Totally agree
1,@ChoooCole Fixed
1,@jordanbpeterson Countries should make their own decisions and not rely on UN bodies like WHO
1,@jordanbpeterson Absolutely
1,@charliekirk11 Won’t be long before there are class-action lawsuits by shareholders against the company and board of directors for destruction of shareholder value
1,@FilmLadd @MattWalshBlog Director related
1,@EndWokeness Not complicated at all
1,Consenting adults should do whatever makes them happy; provided it does not harm others; but a child is not capable of consent; which is why we have laws protecting minors.
1,@MattWalshBlog Works now. Only limit is that it will not be placed next to advertising.
1,@Timcast I am on team humanity
1,Every parent should watch this
1,@cremieuxrecueil Concerning
1,@MattWalshBlog @realDailyWire Will be fixed tomorrow
1,@jordanbpeterson Working on it
1,@teslaownersSV @_hamster_coin Volume should be measured in units of hamster 🐹
1,@TeslaDarth @jordanbpeterson I don’t know anyone who spends so little time online
1,@JeremyDBoreing @realDailyWire The controversy will drive viewership
1,@WholeMarsBlog 🤣 what could go wrong?
1,@SmokeAwayyy Pretty much
1,@DanielleFong Nobody knows who they are as a child
1,@SmokeAwayyy A lot 😑
1,@stevenmarkryan The Streisand Effect on this will set an all-time record!
1,@cb_doge Yeah; it’s great
1,@TheRabbitHole84 @jimjimmiejames This is a major problem. I will be actively lobbying to criminalize making severe; irreversible changes to children below the age of consent.   Shame on those who advocate this! It is utterly contemptible.
1,@stillgray @robbystarbuck @realDailyWire @MattWalshBlog @Twitter @JeremyDBoreing Commenting &amp; deliberate sharing will be allowed. Sensitive content just won’t be pushed to people unless they ask for it or a friend sends it to them.
1,@robbystarbuck @realDailyWire @MattWalshBlog @Twitter @JeremyDBoreing We’re updating the system tomorrow so that those who follow @realDailyWire will see this in their feed; but it won’t be recommended to non-followers (nor will any advertising be associated with it)
1,@dogeofficialceo True
1,@Scobleizer Neuralink
1,@MattWalshBlog It will be advertising-restricted; as advertisers have the right to decide what content their ads appear with; which will impact reach to some degree
1,@e_kaspersky @ElFaith3 Does lockdown mode address this?
1,@TheBabylonBee I do actually like avocado toast tbh lol
1,@InezFeltscher @MattWalshBlog @JeremyDBoreing @realDailyWire Being fixed
1,@tszzl Epic episode!
1,@JonErlichman “Bloomberg Intelligence” 🤣🤣
1,@TheRabbitHole84 @davidmweissman @JeremyDBoreing @realDailyWire Exactly. It is damaging to society to dilute what “hate speech” means.
1,@cb_doge Important to remember that we should not take civilization for granted
1,Lil X just asked if there are police cats; since there are police dogs 😂
1,Congratulations to Giga Shanghai &amp; Tesla China SDS teams for their excellent work overcoming many obstacles over many years!! https://t.co/Q1QKajKR1l
1,@stillgray Happens a lot 🤣🤣
1,@JeremyDBoreing @realDailyWire This was a mistake by many people at Twitter. It is definitely allowed.   Whether or not you agree with using someone’s preferred pronouns; not doing so is at most rude and certainly breaks no laws.   I should note that I do personally use someone’s preferred pronouns; just as I
1,@TitterDaily True
1,38 astronauts to orbit so far!
1,@mattyglesias Now answer the question
1,@mattyglesias Insufferable numbskull

1,Also; you can now change video playback speed
1,@krassenstein This is pretty cool

1,@eldsjal What is a woman?
1,Scrolling through tweets while watching mini video (pic in pic) is great
1,@StreamOnMax Lot of flack for the branding change; but I think it will work out well
1,@TRHLofficial Exactly
1,🇺🇸 For those who died for freedom 🇺🇸
1,@DavidSacks Commercial real estate is melting down fast. Home values next.
1,@Cmdr_Hadfield The China space program is far more advanced than most people realize

1,@monitoringbias True
1,@TRHLofficial @mattyglesias Yeah; answer the question!
1,@TesLatino Sorry; this is one of the last neural nets to be updated to surround video (from single camera; single frame)
1,@LibertyCappy Sounds true
1,@NRO @ariblaff Did they really fire people for calling the police?
1,Incompetence; in the limit; is indistinguishable from sabotage
1,@Forbes Actually; the meme is showing the absurdity of the statement by noting that; if true; it would apply to kids with leukemia
1,@PeterDiamandis If shooting oneself in the foot is disrupting; then I would have to say that I do that a lot
1,@mysteriouskat “Use of ChatGPT is rampant among students today” – students today

1,Hold on to your horse as the carousel of destiny spins ever faster
1,Bruh do you even AI
1,@davidmweissman @Target Maybe it’s not true; hence the question
1,@jack Too many social media companies?
1,Is this true; @Target?
1,@loic @RonDeSantis I have made the invitation several times; including in the DeSantis Spaces itself!
1,@rookisaacman Starship is the first rocket/spaceship with the potential to make life multiplanetary
1,@realMeetKevin @Twitter It’s next-level. People have no idea.
1,@WholeMarsBlog A surprising number of people simply haven’t tried it yet; so have no idea
1,@SpaceX Major launchpad upgrades should be complete in about a month; then another month of rocket testing on pad; then flight 2 of Starship
1,@ylecun You should try Tesla self-driving
1,@WholeMarsBlog This is the right release to go wide
1,Lot of noise about @RonDeSantis announcing &amp; discussing his Presidential bid on this platform.   But you what isn’t noise? Setting an all-time record for fundraising!  Worth considering for announcements in general.
1,@JTLonsdale The attacks against DeSantis are not landing
1,@mysteriouskat @rickygervais I thought he was going to say “Hitsky” at the end
1,@MatthewDR @Tesla Maybe they’re right; but I just have a lot of frens … 🤷‍♂️

1,@EPavlic @MyDogeCTO @MyDogeCEO @nl_dogecoin @DimaZeniuk @RenataKonkoly @Kristennetten @GailAlfarATX @TeslaAIBot @big3aliens @teslaownersSV Unknown; he was a rescue
1,@BillyM2k Happens to me all the time
1,@PicturesFoIder True
1,@aaronsibarium This is crazy – lives are on the line!  The woke mind virus is a parasite that kills its host. It must be eliminated.
1,@WholeMarsBlog It’s not like we didn’t see it coming
1,@shellenberger Why indeed.   If someone wants to change something about themselves as an adult; we should respect that decision.   However; making an irreversible decision for a child is not the child’s decision; it is the adult’s decision; therefore lacking consent.
1,@MarioNawfal @DavidSacks Citizen journalism breaks the monopoly held by a handful of editors – they naturally don’t like that
1,@EvasTeslaSPlaid Yeah
1,@America1stLegal “Total crock”
1,@America1stLegal How did The Washington Post go from questioning the state to being its mouthpiece?
1,@America1stLegal Major problem
1,@America1stLegal @snopes @DailyCaller What say you; @snopes?
1,@America1stLegal This is indeed very disturbing
1,@IAPolls2022 Interesting
1,@eshear I agree
1,@RubinReport Downtown is bleak. The empty parts are actually worse than than the parts with zombies.
1,@Teslaconomics Yeah
1,@KettlebellLife Nope!
1,@kylegriffin1 I call it “massive attention”  Top story on Earth today
1,@WallStreetSilv Twitter new account signups just went ballistic
1,@stillgray @DavidSacks The only reason people even know this is because of screenshots posted on Twitter lol
1,🇺🇸🇺🇸 Untamed Free Speech FTW 🇺🇸🇺🇸
1,@krassenstein Other candidates are welcome
1,@stillgray True
1,@BillyM2k @JoeBiden True 😂
1,All Presidential candidates are most welcome on this platform
1,@WallStreetSilv Interesting
1,@micsolana Yeah
1,Spaces with @RonDeSantis in ~2 hours!
1,@PatrickModin @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Exactly
1,@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Starship payload is 250 to 300 tons to orbit in expendable mode.  Improved thrust &amp; Isp from Raptor will enable ~6000 ton liftoff mass.
1,@WholeMarsBlog The intolerant left is driving people right
1,@Jason @GovRonDeSantis Taking questions from the audience is a powerful move
1,@alx Sure
1,@FredericLambert @Reuters Sneaky @Reuters!
1,@Jason @GovRonDeSantis Any candidate who announces on this platform will get the highest possible audience. It’s a smart move.
1,@KanekoaTheGreat No kidding …

1,@waitbutwhy Do you get one? I hope it works as advertised!
1,@TesLatino Is will be smooth as silk
1,@alex_avoigt Cool!
1,@FelixSchlang @SpaceX Probably; but not yet
1,And works almost everywhere on Earth with global roaming enabled!
1,@WholeMarsBlog And Tesla has Sentry Mode
1,@TheFigen_ Looking into it.   You might want to consider turning on subscriptions.
1,@TeslaSynopsis We’re working hard to get Cybertruck into production! This was a tough product to design &amp; even tougher to build.   But it will be great …
1,Both quality &amp; quantity of high quality posts of all kinds (short text; long essays; pictures; audio &amp; video) have improved dramatically.   Thank you for contributing your voice to humanity’s digital public square!
1,@cb_doge Yeah; it’s great
1,@AOC The kind of interaction that makes this platform so unique &amp; entertaining!  🍿😀
1,@Kristennetten 8 years ago …
1,@PeterDiamandis Write it on Twitter!   Our algorithm automatically gives higher preference for posts which have the most cumulative user-seconds; so native content will be recommended much more than links outside of Twitter.
1,@Kristennetten It’s pretty wild in the Notes world! Many intense battles for best note.  We continue to watch carefully for any gaming of the system.
1,@levelsio Good idea

1,@Jason Nice
1,@goth600 Same
1,@lexfridman I recommend doing Twitter Spaces simultaneously and interacting with users dynamically while recording your podcast
1,@MuskUniversity This is perhaps the most fundamental ratio defining technological progress
1,Great statement by @votetimscott! https://t.co/zMy19ZQ36d
1,@WholeMarsBlog Some easy to fix bugs addressed in 11.4.2 that starts rolling out this weekend. Will address excess conservatism with narrow roads &amp; with lane changes in heavy traffic.
1,@shellenberger The Washington Post has gone from questioning the state to being its propaganda mouthpiece. Pravda would be proud.
1,@AP Either back up your claims @AP with actual source data or retract your story
1,One hell of a plasma beam!
1,@Austen Agreed

1,@realdeepakterra @alx Even were this absurd scenario true; my “bodyguards” being asleep instead of thwarting assassins would be of far greater concern to me than shortening my trip to the 🚽
1,@alx It reads well as comedy
1,@SmokeAwayyy Aargh … gets me every time
1,@goth600 Nice
1,@EdKrassen It is essential to provide the full truth; or as close as possible; to the public; independent of political leanings
1,@DrKnowItAll16 We rolled it out slowly over the past few weeks. Mini viewer coming soon too; so you can watch video while doing other things.
1,I recommend subscribing to @shellenberger
1,@shellenberger @galexybrane “FBI says it won’t release Jan 6 surveillance video because it would show too many undercover government agents and informants”  Uhh … this is insane!!   How many were there? I’m mean … just approximately.
1,@chazman @Tesla The Tesla AI/software team is truly exceptional &amp; I never give false praise
1,I hope this platform increasingly brings you joy &amp; elucidation
1,@EvaFoxU And I will review the audit personally.   If you drive a Tesla; you should be able to believe in it to your core.
1,@teslaownersSV Absolutely
1,@micsolana 🤣 mom ftw
1,@cb_doge Definitely
1,@ehikian Voice &amp; video chat coming soon
1,@Scobleizer @alirocketeer Cool!  Improved video features should land almost every week.
1,@EvaFoxU High time this happened
1,@krassenstein It should not be socially acceptable to call someone an [anything] supremacist; unless there is unequivocal evidence for such a claim
1,@imjdsharp @krassenstein Exactly
1,@WholeMarsBlog There are some jobs that can be done effectively at home; but it is super out of touch to suggest that most people should do so; given that it is impossible.  That’s why I likened it to “Let them eat cake”.
1,@krassenstein @SquawkCNBC @JGreenblattADL I mostly agree with that statement; but talk is cheap – results are what matter.   Downtown SF &amp; LA; for example; are *not* how we want civilization to end up. They are like a low energy version of Mad Max / Last of Us.
1,@SquawkCNBC @JGreenblattADL *Jonathan
1,@WholeMarsBlog There’s probably some really embarrassing stuff in the book 🤣
1,@mysteriouskat True (sigh)
1,@aaronsibarium This is dumb
1,@SquawkCNBC @JGreenblattADL In fairness; I must concede that Joel has a good point and I will endeavor to be more thoughtful in the future.  Comic book analogies are obviously imperfect; to say the least. Just because George Soros can bend metal using his mind doesn’t mean he’s Magneto!!  Anyway; my actual
1,@Austen What!? This is messed up. I’m no vegetarian; but I do want animals to have a happy life.
1,Walter is incredibly thorough in his research. Highly recommend his other books!
1,Happens a lot https://t.co/2IjXLXJ4P3
1,Was the Internet Archive manipulated for nepotistic reasons?
1,@thackerpd Her uncle owns the Wayback machine &amp; you’re saying he deleted information for nepotism? That’s a big deal.
1,@thackerpd @SteveDeaceShow @BretWeinstein This is the most embarrassing thing to come out of The Twitter Files!

1,@DimaZeniuk Frankly; I am pathologically optimistic – it’s a mental condition!   Kinda have to be to try to do all these crazy things.   And I always bite off more than I chew (sigh) &amp; then sit there with puffed out cheeks like a squirrel that ate too much.

1,@Teslaconomics Will give it a shot
1,@krassenstein Thanks!
1,Love to see Starlink providing great connectivity to those who had little or nothing before.   As soon as you can access the Internet; you can learn almost anything; so it’s absolutely essential for education.  @khanacademy being a great example.

1,@Austen @ChrisJBakke I regard that as a good sign :)
1,@TheRabbitHole84 It’s a major problem!
1,@goth600 Pretty much 🤣
1,@krassenstein I agree and probably most Americans do too
1,@ShitpostGate Might be because you have 💩 in your name 😂. Will investigate.
1,@DavidSacks Perfectly said. Among other things;  Soros astutely identified a massive arbitrage opportunity in district attorney elections; where a relatively small amount of money has outsized influence.   Soros’s instructions to his pet prosecutors were (essentially) to minimize prosecuting
1,@aaronjmate No kidding …

1,@DavidSacks The massive jump in monthly payments for a 30 year mortgage; due to high interest rates; obviously greatly reduces home affordability
1,@EdKrassen Don’t spend that $4 all at once 🤣
1,@Teslaconomics Good questions
1,@waitbutwhy Subscribe to Tim Urban – he’s awesome!
1,@alx @sama Accurate
1,@stillgray Rightly so. The disaster that is downtown SF; once beatiful and thriving; now a derelict zombie apocalypse; is due to the woke mind virus.
1,@LibertyCappy They did?
1,@RichardHanania Interesting
1,@Lukewearechange Accurate
1,@zerohedge Rightly so
1,@latayprime Fair point 😂
1,@krassenstein You assume they are good intentions. They are not. He wants to erode the very fabric of civilization. Soros hates humanity.
1,@stillgray We’ve pushed harder for free speech than any other Internet company; including Wokipedia @jimmy_wales
1,Soros reminds me of Magneto
1,@stclairashley That is odd
1,@unusual_whales This is idiotic on so many levels:  1. That cretin never advised me on anything whatsoever.   2. The notion that I would need or listen to financial advice from a dumb crook is absurd.  3. JPM let Tesla down ten years ago; despite having Tesla’s global commercial banking

1,@MattWallace888 @libsoftiktok Yeah
1,@thackerpd @mattyglesias This is par for the course for all Internet companies – we are just going to be clear that it’s happening; unlike the others
1,@astro_greek Maybe we’re in an alien soap opera and just need to keep the ratings high so we don’t get cancelled … ?
1,@astro_greek He makes a strong case for computers being way smarter than humans
1,@Culture_Crit I hope so!
1,@cb_doge Something like that
1,Extremely destructive if accurate https://t.co/qofFxBM29E
1,@krassenstein @mattyglesias We could post what the government in Turkey sent us. Will do.
1,@GailAlfarATX Coming
1,@mattyglesias Did your brain fall out of your head; Yglesias? The choice is have Twitter throttled in its entirety or limit access to some tweets. Which one do you want?
1,@chenbfang @BillyM2k @charliebilello Tragically accurate
1,@imjdsharp @krassenstein I agree
1,@ZubyMusic A lot of people don’t use social media in any significant way

1,@devahaz Is it possible to be LGBTQAnon?
1,@BillboardChris @lindayacc Anyone who maims children should go to prison for life. This shouldn’t even need to be said.
1,@libsoftiktok Computers are literally binary lol
1,@Teslaconomics Yeah
1,@alx Basically yeah
1,@Erdayastronaut No; we still have it. Chamber converging section desperately wants to melt next-level. We also have thermal barrier coatings.
1,@NASASpaceflight @SpaceX Raptor chamber wall might have the highest heat flux of anything ever made
1,@NASASpaceflight @SpaceX Yeah. To be frank; we did not expect the engine to survive a full duration run at that pressure. It is uncharted territory.
1,@JaneidyEve @SpaceX If we can delete &amp; integrate enough secondary structure (small; fiddly bits); then we can locally protect rest &amp; delete engine heat shields
1,Raptor V3 just achieved 350 bar chamber pressure (269 tons of thrust). Congrats to @SpaceX propulsion team!  Starship Super Heavy Booster has 33 Raptors; so total thrust of 8877 tons or 19.5 million pounds. https://t.co/ZlskpCXUmu

1,@WholeMarsBlog Well said
1,@BillboardChris @lindayacc I hear your concerns; but don’t judge too early. I am adamant about defending free speech; even if it means losing money.

1,@WholeMarsBlog Seriously!!
1,@stillgray Exactly
1,@Rainmaker1973 I subscribed! This is one of the best accounts on the platform.
1,@krassenstein Thanks for the note. I think people from both sides of the political spectrum will find Linda to be smart; fair and reasonable.
1,I am excited to welcome Linda Yaccarino as the new CEO of Twitter!  @LindaYacc will focus primarily on business operations; while I focus on product design &amp; new technology.  Looking forward to working with Linda to transform this platform into X; the everything app.

1,@WholeMarsBlog 11.4.1 is promising
1,@cb_doge Tesla self-driving is by far the most advanced real world AI
1,@eldsjal This is becoming a serious scaling challenge
1,@ValueAnalyst1 It is becoming harder for people to get car loans in the US; even when their credit is good.   Understandable that banks are slow to extend credit when they’re trying to avoid bankruptcy themselves!
1,@EngineeringInsd Cool :)
1,@GuyDealership @realEstateTrent You should upload your podcasts to this platform
1,@Rainmaker1973 High time humanity had a moonbase
1,@BillyM2k lol they should keep doing it all day
1,@Rainmaker1973 Shannon was incredible. His work will stand for eternity.
1,@LHSummers @federalreserve @DavidWestin @BloombergTV Between; Tesla; Starlink &amp; Twitter; I may have more real-time global economic data in one head than anyone ever
1,@Anc_Aesthetics Very important
1,@EndWokeness Very concerning
1,@teslaownersSV @jonmcneill Just like AI; human neural net training takes a long time; but inference (applying the knowledge) is relatively easy
1,@LHSummers @federalreserve @DavidWestin @BloombergTV Fed data has too much latency. Mild recession is already here.   It’s not like just the canary in the coal mine (SVB) died; one of the staunchest miners (Credit Suisse) died too &amp; the cemetery is filling up fast!  Further rate hikes will trigger severe recession. Mark my words.
1,@bmorrissey The goal is to make this platform maximum truth-seeking or; said another way; the least untrue compared to everything else
1,@danprimack @jack You’re correct
1,@MacGraeme42 @Anc_Aesthetics @CommunityNotes As more note reviewers from a particular viewpoint pile on; the weight of their note review decreases; thus counteracting brigade / dogpile attacks.  Everything is open source &amp; critique is welcome.   https://t.co/yXgicam3Gz
1,@Anc_Aesthetics @CommunityNotes I agree
1,Home https://t.co/RFJNpCicfh
1,@krassenstein True
1,@FreeSpeechIre Massive attack on freedom of speech
1,@KeithWoodsYT This is a massive attack against freedom of speech
1,Rolling out next month; this platform will allow media publishers to charge users on a per article basis with one click.  This enables users who would not sign up for a monthly subscription to pay a higher per article price for when they want to read an occasional article.
1,@WallStreetSilv Printing over a hundred million newspapers per day is a waste of natural resources
1,@elektrotimmy @Tesla @tesla_europe @MartinViecha @aelluswamy @WholeMarsBlog @jchybow @RealDanODowd We fixed the remaining 2%
1,@JaneidyEve This is an issue with Android Store. Waiting for Google to fix it.
1,All proceeds go to content creators; we keep nothing
1,@GailAlfarATX @keith_dorschner @SawyerMerritt Exactly
1,@alx That’s the acid test
1,Major software upgrades underway across the board.   Encrypted DMs &amp; other DM upgrades rolling out this week.
1,Support content creators around the world in near &amp; far away places!  For many this represents a vital source of income &amp; enables them to put more time into creating great content for you.
1,@farzyness Same
1,@MattWallace888 I mean … what IF something went wrong?
1,@alx Community Notes ftw again lol
1,@EdKrassen That’s a reasonable assessment. My point is that schools have gone too far; especially in “blue” states; and parents are not aware of how bad it is.  A wide array of knowledge; along with critical thinking; should be taught to all children.
1,@krassenstein Hear; hear!
1,@DrEliDavid Worthy of ridicule
1,@ZubyMusic Munchausen Syndrome  https://t.co/l0wTT3vcBf
1,I propose the lmfao test for AI
1,@Rainmaker1973 I recommend subscribing to Massimo
1,@TPostMillennial @billmaher To a shocking degree
1,@rpoo True
1,@TaraBull808 How many of these labs are there?
1,@paulg @harjtaggar @garrytan The bit rate of speech; even “fast” speech”; is absurdly low
1,@LibertyCappy Always has been
1,@growing_daniel @cstanley @ehikian @TitterDaily That fix is in work
1,@growing_daniel @cstanley @ehikian @TitterDaily Yeah
1,@alx @TheBabylonBee The Onion has become jarringly unfunny.   At the heart of humor is a revealed truth; but woke is a lie; so it is humorless.
1,@CollinRugg Most parents have no idea how bad it is
1,@SethDillon Eventually; the worm will turn
1,@billmaher @HBO @RealTimers Thanks for having me
1,Falcon Heavy is green for launch
1,@CommunityNotes Good idea
1,About to do Falcon Heavy risk review. I love that rocket; but it’s scary. So many state changes post liftoff.
1,On @billmaher show tonight
1,@cb_doge We will keep 10% after 12 months; but iOS/Android subscription fees drop from 30% to 15% in year 2; so still a net gain to creators
1,@ID_AA_Carmack Exactly
1,Note; it takes a few days longer for subscriptions to go active on iPhone vs web; as all subscriptions currently have to be approved by Apple
1,@MuskUniversity Physics is the law; everything else is a recommendation.   Anyone can break laws created by people; but I have yet to see anyone break the laws of physics.
1,Content creators can now enable subscriptions to their text; pics &amp; video worldwide on this platform!
1,@Benioff Awesome
1,@paulg Exactly
1,@krassenstein Hear; hear!
1,@Rainmaker1973 Best textbook intro ever
1,@EdKrassen @jacobincambodia I met with many other senior Democratic Party leaders too; many of whom; including Chuck Schumer; I have known for well over a decade.  The Schumer meeting was over an hour. He was kind; thoughtful and asked insightful questions about AI. This man cares about the American people.
1,@EdKrassen Thanks Ed; I appreciate the kind words.   I almost never encounter negativity in gatherings where I can engage in dialogue with people.   When I do encounter some negativity; it’s rare that they can point to anything specific; apart from “bad press”.   Perhaps this comment thread
1,Anyone making materially false statements on this platform will get Community Noted; including you; me; Tucker; advertisers; head of state; etc. No exceptions.   Convince the people and let the chips fall where they may.   @CommunityNotes
1,@FreeBeacon Noted
1,@therealmissjo Is this definitely accurate?
1,[right wing meme]
1,@ZubyMusic Nothing
1,@8teAPi @ESYudkowsky Oh great
1,@krassenstein Very much so
1,The data with which the Federal Reserve is making decisions has too much latency
1,@MuskUniversity Here we stand; after 13.8 billion years; a testament to the fleeting fragility of consciousness
1,@DavidSacks @RobertKennedyJr Remember the Somme
1,@TheRabbitHole84 @jordanbpeterson Munchausen by proxy
1,@SawyerMerritt Good meeting
1,Met with @SenSchumer and many members of Congress about artificial intelligence regulation today.  That which affects safety of the public has; over time; become regulated to ensure that companies do not cut corners.   AI has great power to do good and evil. Better the former.
1,@cb_doge Much has happened
1,@ehikian @alx @bennyjohnson But not in the way it was done last time
1,@DrLoupis Not tolerated on this platform
1,@GRDecter Quite a change
1,@Timcast If you are taught to hate yourself; you will want to be someone else
1,@alx @bennyjohnson Some version of them both is inevitable
1,@krassenstein @ZubyMusic The Swedish study says “sex-reassigned transsexual persons of both genders had approximately a three times higher risk of all-cause mortality than controls”.   If we take as given that the other study 2-3X suicide rate is correct; then doing surgery or chemical sterilization on
1,@paulg Good point
1,@Scobleizer Maybe we are LLMs; living on a GPU &amp; don’t realize it 👀
1,@Scobleizer Kurzweil seems to be right about ~2029
1,@ylecun The hard take-off is already happening. Just zoom out a little.   The most fundamental metric imo is the ratio of digital compute to biological compute vs time. It looks like a wall.
1,@zoealannahbates Anyone up for the task?
1,@krassenstein Seems early to run an attack ad. Also; the AI will be much better next year.
1,@EdKrassen Most people in the west accept abortion in the first trimester; but not in the third trimester.   Europe has a lot of countries; so many variations: https://t.co/CaQ4UjVVPS
1,@EdKrassen Fair enough then re incumbent not doing debates; although that seems like a tradition that should change
1,@SawyerMerritt People still don’t understand the implications of FSD
1,@TalulahRiley I’ve seen quite a few technologies develop; but none with this level of risk. AGI is significantly higher risk than nuclear weapons; in my opinion.  Super smart humans have trouble imagining something vastly smarter than themselves.
1,@TheRabbitHole84 Over the past few decades; among western elites; LGBT shifted from ostracism (or worse) to being the cool kids club
1,@paulg The mass &amp; difficulty required to build a space habitat like that is extreme. Far better to have a base on the moon &amp; city on Mars.
1,@krassenstein Thanks! Will keep at it.
1,@ispace_inc Stream on Twitter too!
1,@zerohedge So bizarre that people and companies don’t use money management (Treasury Bill) checking accounts and earn 4%!
1,@stillgray Really? 🤔
1,@_CryMiaRiver @krassenstein @ZubyMusic I repeat my statement that any parents or doctors who do this should go to prison for life
1,@krassenstein @ZubyMusic Please correct if wrong @CommunityNotes
1,@krassenstein @ZubyMusic Comprehensive study in Sweden shows *increased* suicide!  Death for sex-reassigned persons was higher than for controls of same birth sex; particularly death from suicide. They also had increased risk for suicide attempts and psychiatric inpatient care.   https://t.co/hIakkEJvJb
1,@zerohedge Age limit for sterilization by the state or parents too? Or is that too much to hope for.
1,@krassenstein @ZubyMusic What research?  Every child goes through an identity crisis; but leaping to a permanent solution that sterilizes them for life before they could possibly consent for themselves is wrong. Plain and simple.
1,@TheRabbitHole84 We will do our best to support candidates from all parties; so that the public may make the most informed choice.   Far too much back room dealing seems to be happening.
1,@RobertKennedyJr You and other candidates deserve that opportunity!
1,@tegmark Exactly
1,@ZubyMusic I agree. This is super messed up.  Mature; consenting adults should do as they wish; so long as they do not harm anyone else; but this child was too young for any kind of consent.
1,@CathieDWood Are they simply looking at old data or ignoring the bad data that they have?
1,@eldsjal @Spotify Congrats!
1,@HSajwanization @SarwatNasir @HopeMarsMission Congrats UAE 🇦🇪!!
1,@WallStreetSilv If you weaponize currency enough times; other countries will stop using it
1,@CNNPR Interesting
1,@krassenstein Great points!
1,Verified accounts are now prioritized
1,@johnhackerla That meme rings a bell
1,Sometimes; when you learn about something; you think you have it
1,@farzyness It’s been a while since had to intervene. 11.4 is good.
1,@Not_the_Bee I agree with assisted suicide if someone is a mature adult; but definitely not kids.   There is a reason we have an age of consent.
1,@shaunmmaguire Ask GPT-whatever
1,@farzyness Our meat computers are so slow 😔
1,The collective mind that is this platform needs more signal &amp; less noise
1,@farzyness Collective consciousness
1,@NoemiKhachian @TuckerCarlson @donlemon Odd Couple (2023 remake)
1,@EdKrassen Are you ever critical of someone on the left?
1,@MuskUniversity Can’t shrink humans; so need big rocket
1,@cameron Exactly
1,@GRDecter We’re running out of “everything is fine!” memes
1,@WallStreetSilv @alifarhat79 Literally
1,@JonErlichman WALL-E has decent runway
1,@waitbutwhy Mind-blowing concept when you first hear it.   There is arguably a practical maximum to digits of pi; which is the number required to divide the universe into cubes of Planck length.
1,Censor not; lest ye be censored
1,@KanekoaTheGreat @DavidSacks Exactly right. If we lose freedom of speech; it’s never coming back.  Beware of censorship lest ye censored.
1,@unusual_whales Nice. Just me here @elonmusk too. If something dumb is said; it’s definitely me.
1,@ErcXspace @SpaceX Gravity; gravity;  time to escape  that for me
1,Or maybe just X
1,@waitbutwhy Thanks!
1,@Erdayastronaut I just subscribed
1,@nichegamer @Marsupial_Gamer I subscribed!
1,@investmattallen @GRDecter More
1,@krassenstein To paraphrase a famous statement about democracy:  Free press is the worst form of press – except for all the others that have been tried.
1,@cscarroll @GRDecter @TuckerCarlson @MrBeast Jimmy (@mrbeast) has already enabled subscriptions on this platform
1,@GRDecter Or we don’t hire anyone; but simply enable content creators to prosper on this platform without applying censorship that goes beyond the law
1,We’re rapidly improving transparency &amp; fairness on this platform; but there is still a lot of work to do
1,Hard to believe Starship actually did launch on 4/20 lol
1,@cb_doge You’d never guess it’s me!
1,@EvaFoxU @smithynimmy It will be soon
1,@WallStreetSilv I kinda love Cramer
1,Content creators may wish to enable subscriptions on this platform.   Just tap on Monetization in settings. https://t.co/CmD06Mczmn
1,@PeterDiamandis If heat death is the fate of the Universe; it really is all about the journey
1,We live in the most interesting of times
1,@PeterDiamandis I love your relentless optimism in an otherwise pessimistic world!
1,@KanekoaTheGreat @DavidSacks Exactly
1,@paulg Interesting
1,@DavidSacks Pretty much
1,@DavidSacks Thoughtful article by @Politico
1,@waitbutwhy It will be a Brave New World
1,@teslaownersSV This really opens your eyes. If they’re this wrong about Tesla; what subjects are they actually right about?
1,@TrungTPhan This resonates
1,@BillyM2k @StockMKTNewz It has gone full beyond
1,@kerrikgray Intense week
1,@MarioNawfal Twitter is a serious danger to their ability to control the narrative
1,@oldbooksguy Orwell was right -&gt; schools &amp; media Huxley -&gt; public *is* heavily medicated  Rand was also right; as you say.  We now have the perfect storm.   Did you know that Soma is a real drug? Takes away pain; but dulls your mind.
1,@BillyM2k I’ll take him!
1,@DogecoinNorway Or; at least; that’s what Snorri said  https://t.co/P1N6FNqyNg

1,@unhealthytruth Good points
1,@TheRabbitHole84 True
1,@farzyness There have been several extended periods of flatness; followed by rapid rises to new plateaus
1,@jnsfrd Amazing
1,@WallStreetSilv Incentives matter
1,@Scobleizer Allergies
1,@Healthyfairy86 @unusual_whales Certainly should be same for all
1,@unusual_whales Is all this just about raising the pension age from 62 to 64 or is there more to it?
1,@Fathers_Writes Malaria did it for me
1,The least bad solution to the AGI control problem that I can think of is to give every verified human a vote
1,@TitterDaily A troll; me?? 🤣
1,@unusual_whales Not exactly neutral
1,@charliesheen You’re welcome!
1,What makes @CommunityNotes so powerful is that people with different points of view have to agree that a note is correct for it to be shown
1,@TrungTPhan So many Zoolander memes 😂
1,check mate
1,@EdKrassen Do you write in defense of the truth?
1,@EzerRatchaga Starship is super insane; but such a system is the only way for us to become a multiplanet civilization
1,@RBReich I will pay for your blue check – my gift to you 💕
1,@rpoo Well said
1,@RBReich Have you considered a career in comedy?
1,@SciGuySpace Still early in analysis; but the force of the engines when they throttled up may have shattered the concrete; rather than simply eroding it. The engines were only at half thrust for the static fire test.
1,@stats_feed @paulg Demographics is destiny
1,@krassenstein @EdKrassen Anointed nobility is anathema  Quality of content counts
1,@TimSweeneyEpic Exactly

1,@stevenmarkryan Being a Mom is a real job that deserves major respect
1,@DavidSacks Everyone pays the same price for a Tesla; including me. Same goes for new Twitter.

1,@tunguz Rust
1,@DisneyMusic @starwars @DisneyPlus Bad Batch is great

1,Starship liftoff in slow motion https://t.co/KqHjqwP88Z
1,@Rainmaker1973 Deep time is disturbing
1,@Rainmaker1973 But super obvious in infrared
1,@mezaoptimizer You correctly highlight the absurdity
1,@unusual_whales Lithium ore is very common throughout Earth. What matters is refining capacity.
1,@WallStreetSilv The caffeine one is most concerning! Like … how much caffeine did that spider get!?
1,@nicksortor At this point; I’m quite curious about the manifesto!
1,@EdKrassen I certainly agree that this requires a nuanced evaluation of all the facts; but please stop with the Russian bogeyman
1,@ggreenwald Next-level irony!
1,@PeterDiamandis Hear; hear!!
1,@DavidSacks There needs to be some accountability here!
1,@RGVaerialphotos All that’s left of the concrete lateral support beam is the rebar! Hopefully; this didn’t gronk the launch mount.
1,@wintonARK Interesting thread
1,@SciGuySpace 3 months ago; we started building a massive water-cooled; steel plate to go under the launch mount.   Wasn’t ready in time &amp; we wrongly thought; based on static fire data; that Fondag would make it through 1 launch.  Looks like we can be ready to launch again in 1 to 2 months.
1,@EdKrassen 🤣🤣 It’s a real thing
1,@EdKrassen We’ve started a “save-a-celebrity fund” to pay their $8. We take this matter very seriously.
1,@paulg I’ll pay for yours
1,@alx What say you @SecBlinken?
1,@shellenberger @briebriejoy @robbysoave They got caught
1,@DavidSacks Exactly

1,@verified Tomorrow is shaping up to be quite the day!
1,@alx Heck of a coincidence!
1,@stevenmarkryan (This will be fixed)
1,@stevenmarkryan There is a roughly 2 GB (compressed) file size limit; so uploading at 720p resolution should work
1,@WilliamShatner You will always be my captain
1,@stevenmarkryan Why not upload to Twitter subscribers?
1,@cb_doge One day
1,@ExplainThisBob I love Bob
1,@krassenstein @TitterDaily I’m open to ideas; but ripping off the Twitter database; demonetizing it (removing ads) and then selling our data to others isn’t a winning solution
1,@TheRabbitHole84 @jonesville Very rapid increase!
1,@DrAseemMalhotra Why did they do that?
1,@DrJBhattacharya They should at least have mentioned that the clinical trials didn’t check for transmission-blocking
1,@MattWallace888 Exactly
1,@JonErlichman Baby me
1,@TitterDaily They trained illegally using Twitter data. Lawsuit time.
1,@ToscaMusk @mayemusk Happy birthday; Love E!

1,Fun times 🤩
1,@teslaownersSV This will be great. Coming soon. Maximum protection for users.
1,@Anc_Aesthetics Sorry about this. Yes; subscribe now via web or wait a few days for Apple to approve.   Note: creator gets ~92% of subscription for web subscribers (Stripe &amp; CC fees are ~8%); but only 70% on iOS/Android.   Twitter keeps nothing. All funds we receive go to the content creator.
1,@stevenmarkryan Takes a few days for Apple to approve subscriptions; iOS lags web subscriptions by a few days
1,@TheRabbitHole84 Population collapse is a massive threat to civilization
1,Canadian Broadcasting Corp said they’re “less than 70% government-funded”; so we corrected the label https://t.co/lU1EWf76Zu
1,@alx Fundamentally important
1,@itsALLrisky @TitterDaily @CBC Good point; generosity is always the right move. 69% it is!
1,@TitterDaily @CBC Their concern has been addressed https://t.co/pSm6KotlZL
1,Mini Starship with flame! https://t.co/VGKHyaikTd
1,@TitterDaily @CBC Just trying to be accurate. Would they be ok if we said 70% govt funded?
1,@Investingcom Was alerted this weekend. Looking into it.
1,@__SeriousGemini Fate
1,Learned a lot today; now offloading propellant; retrying in a few days …
1,A pressurant valve appears to be frozen; so unless it starts operating soon; no launch today
1,Cryogenic propellant load of Starship is underway; liftoff in T minus 1 hour
1,Starship launch attempt in ~7 hours

1,@alifarhat79 I subscribed
1,@stillgray It’s felt like that for a long time

1,@GavinSBaker @FutureJurvetson @MarcRandolph At scale; you hit limit of available power; so it’s just useful compute per Joule.  The “useful” qualifier is important.
1,@FutureJurvetson @MarcRandolph @GavinSBaker Useful compute per unit of energy is what will matter most
1,And people who steal memes! https://t.co/RNjmq4Aifo
1,@TeslaHype The timing of this couldn’t be worse
1,@TheRabbitHole84 The so-called chief “fact-checker” at Washington Post has been dinged by @CommunityNotes several times for making false statements 🤣🤣
1,Your direct experience; people you talk to in the subject area &amp; independent research will get you much closer to the truth
1,The BBC interview last week was exceptional in illustrating why you cannot rely on the media for truth
1,@ID_AA_Carmack I still have launch PTSD from early Falcon days. My limbic system twists my guts into a knot as we get closer to launch.
1,It’s worth considering deleting your blocks. What’s the worst that can happen? Words &amp; emojis …
1,@dogeofficialceo Haha 💯
1,@maidensheildio @engineers_feed This platform is great for #3
1,@EvaFoxU Haha
1,That’s why I deleted my block list
1,Negative feedback received on this platform is great for reducing ego-based errors
1,@SmokeAwayyy Gets me every time
1,@JimHansonDC @Grimezsz @TrungTPhan Coming
1,@Grimezsz @TrungTPhan *unreleased
1,@Grimezsz @TrungTPhan Try enabling subscriptions and posting unrelated songs &amp; music videos for fans
1,@NathanLands You should consider enabling subscriptions for your account
1,@nathanbaugh27 Good book @StephenKing
1,@WallStreetSilv True. That is happening in schools today.
1,@fchollet Imagine how this makes FOMO Capital (the VC firm) feel!
1,@alx That is *actually* what they did. Going forward; this platform will be fair &amp; transparent.
1,@EndWokeness Odd for period pieces
1,@SmokeAwayyy With booster ultimately flying up to ~20 times per day &amp; ship flying up to ~5 times per day.   Useful load to Mars is ~150 metric tons; but requires ~5 orbital refilling tanker flights.  Target: &gt;1 megaton of cargo &amp; people delivered to Mars; so that it becomes self-sustaining.
1,@dvorahfr You should sign up for subscriptions; then; for example; post low res images free and high res for subscribers or whatever you want
1,@teslaownersSV There is massive uncertainty with a new launch. We don’t know exactly when it will fly.
1,@cb_doge Anyone who thinks this risk is 0% is an idiot
1,@alx @nytimes I can’t tell parody from reality these days
1,@teslaownersSV I have a feeling it might get delayed 3 days …
1,Success maybe; excitement guaranteed!
1,@BillyM2k Lot of ways for AI to go wrong
1,@ylecun Speak for yourself
1,@TitterDaily Am doing interviews across the political spectrum.  BBC’s SF division is “left wing”; as evidenced by the questions he asked.   Tucker is “right wing”.   Next week; I will do interviews with moderate &amp; slightly left media.
1,@zerohedge The New York Times has fallen so far it’s tragic. Now; they don’t even have a verified check. 😢
1,@dvorahfr Let’s have an AI-designed fashion show irl
1,@ggreenwald @michaelcrowley All the news that’s fit for … I forgot the last part
1,@EndWokeness That’s messed up
1,@all_in_tok @SFGovTV @theallinpod @DavidSacks @Jason Exactly. Take a walk through downtown around Twitter HQ. Outrageous that city officials would claim that it is not dangerous!
1,@CollinRugg The American public certainly needs to understand and our elected representatives must consent to our involvement
1,@farzyness True
1,@TrungTPhan You content is great. How many subscribers do you have?
1,@neurosp1ke Hypocrisy
1,@WallStreetSilv Tough job
1,@RepJeffries Legislators doing nada is often way better than the alternative
1,@LibertyCappy Plastic straws are fine https://t.co/KJi1oXIHbr
1,@TRHLofficial Haha
1,@JonErlichman Leadership can make all the difference in the world
1,@Rainmaker1973 Amazing that carbon in diamond form is ~5 times better at conducting heat than the best metal (silver) https://t.co/9Ezc6o4eWa
1,@TRHLofficial Any parent or doctor who sterilizes a child before they are a consenting adult should go to prison for life
1,@teslaownersSV Unfortunate; but true
1,@farzyness Just run a poll after you post a movie
1,@stevenmarkryan What’s a woman?
1,@DaleStarkA10 Far better than being indoctrinated by the state!
1,@MrSolanaGod The AI figured out what it meant
1,And sometimes a discussion on Spaces
1,Once every few weeks; I will do an ask-me-anything for subscribers only
1,@ZubyMusic One should always be wary of the popular thing
1,@romechenko Not bad
1,@teslaownersSV The news tries to answer the question: what’s the worst thing that happened on Earth today? That’s why it’s so misery-inducing.
1,@oldbooksguy The weakness of an NPC is their limited dialogue tree
1,@stevenmarkryan CBS/NPR have engaged in extreme hypocrisy.   Fate loves irony; but despises hypocrisy.
1,@WholeMarsBlog Exactly!
1,@MuskUniversity Tough years
1,@unkonfined Should just work
1,@BillyM2k App update needed
1,@zerohedge Dark if true lol
1,@dogeofficialceo Daily Mail has some great headlines 🤣
1,@BillyM2k @herbertong We will that to the feature list; but right now you can easily post “here is 30 secs of my awesome video; subscribe to see it all”
1,@slashdot Scale does matter
1,@BillyM2k @0xgaut True
1,@herbertong You can post partial videos for free and reserve full video for subscribers
1,@RyanTanaka3 @herbertong Exactly
1,@BillyM2k @unusual_whales It should work via web interface
1,@FonsDK @WholeMarsBlog @jasondebolt @SawyerMerritt @teslaownersSV @forwardcap @farzyness @garyblack00 Reaching volume production &amp; achieving positive cash flow is insanely hard
1,@EvaFoxU Agreed. One step at a time.
1,@ylecun @RichardSocher Yeah
1,@BillyM2k That would be great!
1,@cb_doge Great point. We will add that!
1,@BillyM2k @dogeofficialceo Currently; all subscribers have to be approved by Apple for iOS. We’re waiting for the next batch to approved.
1,@ChrisJBakke Dogs rock
1,@TimSweeneyEpic Exactly
1,@Anc_Aesthetics @ICannot_Enough @SF___Tahoe Working on it
1,@dvorahfr We should dress in far more interesting ways than we currently do!
1,@SpectralMana @Liv_Boeree We’re removing that requirement
1,For the next 12 months; Twitter will keep none of the money.   You will receive whatever money we receive; so that’s 70% for subscriptions on iOS &amp; Android (they charge 30%) and ~92% on web (could be better; depending on payment processor).  After first year; iOS &amp; Android fees
1,@stillgray Working on it
1,@ICannot_Enough @SF___Tahoe You might want to consider enabling subscriptions for some of your work or just so that people can thank you
1,Apply to offer your followers subscriptions of any material; from longform text to hours long video!  Just tap on “Monetization” in settings.
1,@BiirbG Sickkk; but who can make it?
1,@SahilBloom If heath death of the Universe is how things end; it really is all about the journey
1,@mahmoudfoqha9 @cb_doge It would be good to have Twitter worldwide
1,@cb_doge Well; technically it is both for me
1,@OurielOhayon I really do
1,Turning AI-designed fashion into real clothing would be great
1,@SenSchumer Good news! AI regulation will be far more important than it may seem today.
1,@WholeMarsBlog Exactly
1,@paulg Yeah
1,@ggreenwald @Snowden That’s messed up
1,@mayemusk Congratulations!
1,@EvaFoxU @WholeMarsBlog Sunlight is the best disinfectant; so let’s shed some light on the media puppet-masters!
1,@loracyaknosiner @WholeMarsBlog 💯 It’s Anchor Man en masse; but who wrote the memo?
1,@Erch03 @WholeMarsBlog That would be sickkk 🤣
1,@IanSharar @WholeMarsBlog If what you say is true; who is writing the bs they’re buying?
1,@PopCatalin @Tillsbury1 @WholeMarsBlog Definitely not 🤣
1,@WholeMarsBlog Like talking marionettes … but who is pulling the strings?
1,@ggreenwald Interesting
1,@hiromichimizuno @Tesla Thank you for your excellent contribution to Tesla!
1,@stevenmarkryan Buy when others panic; sell when they’re irrationally exuberant
1,@KanekoaTheGreat Sure yeah; yeah; definitely not influenced by the state …
1,@zerohedge Publicly funded PBS joins publicly funded NPR in leaving Twitter in a huff after being labeled “Publicly Funded” 🤣
1,@ehikian Maybe we should use something else or make our own
1,@ggreenwald @ISDglobal This cast of characters show up a lot
1,@mezaoptimizer Interesting
1,@alx Good ideas
1,@TheBabylonBee He is entertaining in his own way lol
1,@JoshSeefried @BillyM2k We’re working on it. Twitter has a surprisingly complex codebase; so progress is slower than we’d like.
1,@BillyM2k We’re firing up creator subscriptions bigtime! Works for longform text; pics or video.
1,@cb_doge Facts
1,@TimSweeneyEpic @ITIFdc This is why paid verification is essential. Won’t stop people using AI for impersonation &amp; scams; but it increases cost &amp; difficulty of doing so by several orders of magnitude.
1,NPR literally says Federal funding is *essential* on their website right now at https://t.co/QA8TUZxmNO  What have you got against the truth @NPR? https://t.co/3W0X0MsZYW
1,@BillyM2k @ZubyMusic Currently stuck in Apple App Store approval process; so button works on web &amp; Android; but not yet iOS
1,@cb_doge @dvorahfr I will pay a million Dogecoin for proof of this mine’s existence!
1,@ZubyMusic @ChrissieMayr Yeah
1,@zerohedge Buffett is earning crazy money from his Treasury bills
1,@Jason @BBCWorld Unreal
1,@NPR Hello?
1,@medicgordus Good find
1,@DrJBhattacharya Exactly
1,@BillyM2k @unusual_whales Tough sledding until spring next year is my best guess
1,@BBCWorld I do say in the interview that I have a lot of respect for the @BBC. No organization is perfect; or course; but the BBC overall quite good.
1,Guess they won’t mind losing Federal funding in that case 🤷‍♂️
1,NPR literally said “Federal funding is essential to public radio” on their own website (now taken down).   What hypocrites! https://t.co/kYAXW0zpyl
1,Defund @NPR
1,@BillyM2k This will make some people upset; but I need to emphasize that accelerating synthetic mRNA technology was another silver lining. It is a revolution in medicine; like going from analog to digital.  The Covid mRNA vaccine dosage level was too high and having a zillion booster shots
1,@MuskUniversity Yeah
1,@cb_doge @BBCWorld Seriously 🤣🤣
1,@TheRabbitHole84 Exactly; “misinformation” is indeed the Trojan horse for censorship
1,@TeslaOwnersEBay @Twitter What more could you ask for in a CEO!?

1,@Liv_Boeree @micsolana Exactly
1,This time with video &amp; better audio

1,@KanekoaTheGreat @DavidSacks Absolutely
1,@alx He has black turtleneck &amp; husky voice – what more do you need!?
1,@farzyness Yeah
1,I said BBC could come Twitter; then; to my surprise; a reporter shows up
1,Penetrating deep &amp; hard with @BBC
1,@stillgray @alx The world wants to know!
1,@alx [NSFW warning]
1,@DavidSacks Now we’ll never know if he likes BBC!
1,@TitterDaily Yeah
1,Doing a Twitter Spaces interview in 10 mins with the @JamesClayton5 of @BBC
1,@micsolana True; civilization uses a tiny amount of energy. Just seems high to us silly monkeys.  Our sun; which is not particularly special as stars go; turns over 4M tons of mass into energy every second!
1,@DavidSacks Amazing
1,@supermariomovie Many people I know love it!
1,@micsolana So inspiring to see that they have their priorities right
1,Final date for removing legacy Blue checks is 4/20
1,@MuskUniversity Yeah
1,@Liv_Boeree @micsolana It’s super easy to get Fentanyl *right now*. People buy it in open air drug markets in SF and take it right in front of you in broad daylight! They don’t even try to hide. I see this almost every time I drive to Twitter.  Just as with alcohol prohibition; people didn’t actually
1,@rawsalerts @ellagirwin @stillgray @nicksortor We are going to re-examine this policy
1,@mgsiegler People give up reporting crime when no action is taken or the criminal is immediately released. They actually call it “catch and release”.
1,@disclosetv Phew
1,@0xgaut Not totally wrong. Slept on a friend’s couch last weekend.
1,@westcoastbill Indeed
1,@WallStreetSilv Big problem
1,@KanekoaTheGreat Good question
1,@amuse @96hoya Downtown SF looks like a zombie apocalypse. People who’ve not been there have no idea.
1,@JTLonsdale The court proceedings will hopefully illuminate this matter
1,@Austen Amazing
1,We need a VP of Propaganda … errr I mean Public Relations!
1,@SmokeAwayyy Sigh
1,@pri13420 @investmattallen @ShellenbergerMD @robbysoave Yes; but; more importantly; doing so by massive theft of Twitter data
1,@investmattallen @ShellenbergerMD @robbysoave We’re enabling users to post long articles &amp; earn income from subscribers; but we’re not excluding other media.   Substack was temporarily categorized as “unsafe” when we discovered that they were illegally downloading vast amounts of data to pre-populate their Twitter clone.
1,@KanekoaTheGreat 2003 is an old survey; so Russian doesn’t dominate as much then as in 2012; but the point remains valid
1,@KanekoaTheGreat Almost no one among the cognoscenti even knows this.   Why does our western press insist on pushing such a lopsided view of the conflict?   They must either think that the public is too dumb to understand nuance or the press themselves lack a deep understanding.
1,@WallStreetSilv Their technology is so ancient. World of Warcraft economy is lightyears better (actually).
1,@LordTJCrypto Nice
1,An advantage of having organizational affiliation on this platform is that you can change your name without losing verification.  More importantly; it helps greatly with reducing impersonation fraud.
1,@micsolana I think we should legalize it. The probability of overdose or a bad batch is greatly reduced if there is actual QA &amp; regulation.  Also; crime flourishes when substances are made illegal. Alcohol is very much a “drug” – it’s just a legacy drug from olden times when we had no
1,@PeterDiamandis Your boundless optimism is uplifting!
1,Tbh; I’m just hoping a media org that takes itself way too seriously writes a story about Harry Bōlz …
1,@BillyM2k Say that at a party; then spit in their drinks &amp; walk out the room. Baller move.
1,@KnowledgeArchiv The Roman corvus; invented for the Battle of Mylae; would probably have been faster.   Carthage thought they had the best fleet. Their overconfidence led to their defeat.  https://t.co/PyV5rhG2pO
1,On the Internet; I’m only 3 inches tall (best case)
1,@davidmweissman That is true for some; but for many it was simply because they had a buddy at Twitter or were a Mashable intern 10 years ago or they outright bought it
1,@cb_doge @JonErlichman We’re working on Burnt Hair. Has to be just right.
1,@davidmweissman What is the principle?
1,@JonErlichman Boring Company: Flamethrower (Not a)
1,@TeslaAIBot If that were actually true; “the rich” of 100 years ago would have all the money today; but they do not
1,@UmarBzv Modern dentistry is underappreciated
1,@davidmweissman What if we create a “Help-a-Celebrity” fund to pay the $7?
1,Impersonating others is wrong!
1,@farzyness dke yeah u know me
1,@ZubyMusic The underlying principle: if you don’t like reality; just ignore it!
1,@AiBreakfast A classic
1,Starship launch trending towards near the end of third week of April
1,@teslaownersSV Some duct tape &amp; superglue will fix this right up!
1,@Mikeggibbs Extremists of any kind tend to lack a sense of humor; because they live in a state of outrage and dehumanize the other side
1,@all_in_tok @DavidSacks Absolutely
1,@ShellenbergerMD Good question. Who are the people responsible for this nightmare situation?
1,They tried to muffle our titter 🤭
1,@TRHLofficial This is a controversial take; but I think it’s time we let women vote
1,@iamharaldur What does a dyslexic; agnostic amnesiac who believes in crypto do?  Lies up all night thinking about Doge.
1,Our landlord at SF HQ says we’re legally required to keep sign as Twitter &amp; cannot remove “w”; so we painted it background color. Problem solved! https://t.co/1iFjccTbUq

1,@dogeofficialceo Passing butter https://t.co/BQodkxl2BZ
1,@TitterDaily @MikeIsaac Oh stop 🥰
1,@davidasinclair If you want to know what actually matters; just get a life insurance quote. That cuts out the bs.   If you think you’re smarter than them; start a life insurance company and put them out of business.
1,@JonkariP Epic 🤣
1,@waitbutwhy The precision of our biological clock across trillions of cells is incredible. One never sees someone with an old left arm; but a young right arm.  Aging can obviously be fixed. The real question is whether it should be.
1,@davidmweissman @TitterDaily Too much corruption with how legacy checks were handed out in the past.   As @TimSweeneyEpic said; accounts should grow or shrink their influence based on the quality of their posts; not because they were anointed by someone years ago at Twitter.
1,@stevenmarkryan Long-term thinking will be rewarded
1,@EndWokeness We need to add more granularity to editorial influence; as it varies greatly. I don’t actually think the BBC is as biased as some other government-funded media; but it is silly of the BBC to claim zero influence.  Minor government influence in their case would be accurate.
1,@WallStreetSilv I do actually follow the BBC – they have some great material
1,@TimSweeneyEpic It’s coming
1,@WallStreetSilv What does BBC stand for again? I keep forgetting.

1,I’m almost there https://t.co/Sxb11nbtnh
1,@TitterDaily This platform will neither promote nor limit their accounts; but we will rapidly address any attempts at gaming the system.  It is a weak move to engage in censorship just because others do so. Letting our press be free when theirs is not demonstrates strength.
1,@TrungTPhan Wd sync w ur iPhone &amp; tell u when 2 💩
1,@TrungTPhan I’d buy one tbh
1,@TheRabbitHole84 He must really want it to pay so much; but what does he want?
1,@DavidSacks @VivekGRamaswamy @GregAbbott_TX Yeah; wrong on many levels. Tesla is increasing production rapidly in Texas; California &amp; Nevada.  Our competitors require subsidies; not us. That said; if competitors get subsidies; Tesla should get them too.  Tesla’s competitive position would improve if all subsidies ended.
1,@AnonOpsUnited I’m told Putin called me a war criminal for helping Ukraine; so he’s not exactly my best friend.  All news is to some degree propaganda. Let people decide for themselves.

1,@TheRabbitHole84 @ScottAdamsSays True
1,Happy Easter!
1,@TrungTPhan Wow. Oh well; still awesome.
1,@paulg Our lifespan is programmed into our genes; just like it is for fruit flies or pets.  Fruit are already vegan &amp; even if they do yoga every day &amp; take every supplement; they still only live 50 days.
1,@ScottAdamsSays I am told that his son is de facto in charge
1,Tesla opening Megapack factory in Shanghai to supplement output of Megapack factory in California
1,@paulg Once prominent; they’re one of the few to have succeeded. Too much talent is chasing software; much like Hollywood has too much talent chasing acting.  It’s silly to have 10 talented entrepreneurs all chase same SaaS niche when they could be epically successful in heavy industry.
1,@BillyM2k Yeah; it’s weird
1,@paulg Major misallocation of capital imo. Most on this list won’t make it.  Not enough talent in manufacturing &amp; heavy industries.

1,Starship is ready for launch 🚀  Awaiting regulatory approval
1,@WholeMarsBlog We need to predict what pedestrians will do based on their behavior; including limb angle &amp; direction of sight.   FSD currently sees all pedestrians as cuboids; so is overly cautious.  Also; diffusion seems to be more compute-efficient than transformers for vision.

1,@DimaZeniuk @SpaceX @SirineAti @captainarve @andst7 @WholeMarsBlog @EvasTeslaSPlaid @GailAlfarATX @JaneidyEve @TeslaAIBot @1stMarsColonist And we need to add 3 more Raptor Vacuum engines; because it’s inevitable
1,@DimaZeniuk @SpaceX @SirineAti @captainarve @andst7 @WholeMarsBlog @EvasTeslaSPlaid @GailAlfarATX @JaneidyEve @TeslaAIBot @1stMarsColonist Will get bigger. Ship will probably stretch by another 10m or so.

1,Friendship takes work; enmity is effortless
1,@teslaownersSV @MuskUniversity Haha exactly
1,@natfriedman So many stories just like this
1,@GavinSBaker We’ve made some upgrades
1,@BretWeinstein 1. Substack links were never blocked. Matt’s statement is false.   2. Substack was trying to download a massive portion of the Twitter database to bootstrap their Twitter clone; so their IP address is obviously untrusted.  3. Turns out Matt is/was an employee of Substack.

1,@WholeMarsBlog True
1,@HeidiBriones @strxwmxn For a Community Note to be shown widely; it must be approved by multiple reviewers with different viewpoints.   If both left &amp; right wing reviewers agree on a Note; then it is highly likely to be accurate!  This is a big part of the (not) secret sauce.  It is all open source.
1,@SciGuySpace Just a scratch
1,@ylecun @yoavgo No one at OpenAI signed it; so it’s irrelevant
1,Caused by expired ground station cert. We’re scrubbing the system for other single-point vulnerabilities.
1,Sorry; slight glitch with @SpaceX Starlink. Coming back online now.
1,@terronk Also; believe your eyes as you walk around downtown SF. It’s insane.
1,@terronk Well-said
1,@CSI_Starbase @LabPadre High-strength stainless steel armor is needed to protect the launch stand from the world’s biggest blowtorch!  Even steel will be eroded fast by the Starship booster plume. We will need to make a water-cooled steel jacket to achieve full reusability.
1,@WholeMarsBlog I am dumb way more often than I’d like to be!
1,@thatrpb @micsolana Most critics these days seem to write for each other; rather than the public.   I miss Roger Ebert.
1,@ylecun Yeah; cockatoos too!
1,@greg_price11 Sounds messed up
1,@TitterDaily This will be great for reducing impersonation risk
1,@WallStreetSilv This trend will accelerate
1,@SF___Tahoe True; it was my worst decision ever
1,@amuse @Riley_Gaines_ Messed up
1,@slashdot Noice
1,@WholeMarsBlog So many well off critics don’t understand that demand at scale is limited by affordability.   There is plenty of demand for our products; but if the price is more money than people have; that demand is irrelevant.

1,@Chad_Hurley 🤣 don’t fall asleep on the floor with long hair and a Roomba
1,@SmokeAwayyy Scary. I suppose it’s not boring; but still.
1,@ellagirwin I should emphasize that someone really has to go over-the-top by repeatedly harassing the same account with no provocation to get their post bounced. This is not a hair-trigger situation.
1,@PatrickJBlum These are great
1,@ZubyMusic True
1,@EvaFoxU fazedarrayftw
1,@MiamiHerald Very misleading headline
1,@ZubyMusic @stillgray But awesome for trolling
1,@terrybythebay @TitterDaily Who … me? ☺️ 🧌
1,@wongmjane Not a bad suggestion. Will consider.
1,@TitterDaily Yeah; you can totally delete things from the Internet – that works perfectly and doesn’t draw attention to whatever you were trying to hide at all
1,@StephenKing Oh stop with the compliments! 😊
1,Starship is stacked &amp; ready to launch next week; pending regulatory approval
1,@DirtyTesLa We are gradually reducing it; proportionate to improved safety

1,@GRDecter Probably Buffett. He could do it using less than an hour’s time per week.
1,@cb_doge Actually; will add this app to my name in the meantime
1,@KanekoaTheGreat Is this real?

1,@cb_doge As soon as we finish functionality for multi-org affiliation
1,@RubinReport @ChristinaPushaw @MiamiHerald If they’re misleading the public; @CommunityNotes will correct them

1,@SciGuySpace They need to make reusable rockets
1,@cb_doge Cool

1,@andst7 Fermi was incredible.   I like that he cared that we see no evidence of  aliens. It is a fundamental question about the nature of the universe.
1,@alx @CommunityNotes @GlennKesslerWP Maybe a link under the account name to the list of Community Notes of an account that is frequently posting incorrect information
1,@jakeshieldsajj Very sorry to hear that. Many people I know have been severely assaulted.  Violent crime in SF is horrific and even if attackers are caught; they are often released immediately.  Is the city taking stronger action to incarcerate repeat violent offenders @BrookeJenkinsSF?

1,@TitterDaily First I’ve heard about this. Did they identify what content they’re concerned about?
1,@AdamLowisz @David_Leavitt @BillyM2k Agreed. The moral guiding star should be to stop racism; not replace one form of it with another; as some have done.
1,@jachiam0 Very true
1,@David_Leavitt @BillyM2k The rules are consistent. Even though I think you’re awful and I consider Billy Markus to be a friend; he still had to delete his post or be suspended.
1,@SenSchumer To avoid losing the trust of the American public; it is important that our justice system pursue Democrats and Republicans with equal vigor.  Whichever party most puts justice before nepotism is the one that deserves trust.
1,@SawyerMerritt @Tesla Tesla will continue to use outside litigators; but it’s important to build a powerful litigation team internally; so that we’re not always on the defensive.   We’ll also go after the Wall St short-sellers; certain law firms &amp; (sometimes) corrupt regulators who are the true evil.
1,If the Dem Party had a time machine https://t.co/a1QE7JcGLB
1,@yhazony straing daze theze r
1,@krishnanrohit True
1,@alyssamvance 🤣 true
1,@planet4589 Spending time in deep space doesn’t seem to affect lifespan
1,@ikristoph @brickroad7 Team is closing the loop on interventions very rapidly. To get enough training examples for potential serious accidents; we have to run them in sim; as we have so few in the fleet; despite doing ~1M miles per day of FSD.
1,@brickroad7 Yup; happening in plain sight
1,@cb_doge I’ve been saying this for over a decade
1,@BillyM2k Very true
1,@Jason Probably correct
1,@WholeMarsBlog If we had been allowed to introduce new evidence; the verdict would’ve been zero imo.  Jury did the best they could with the information they had. I respect the decision.
1,@TheRabbitHole84 Wise words. The technology finally exists to change that.
1,@andst7 @CommunityNotes Thanks for the correction
1,@jborg_arts Why would anyone who doesn’t live in New York care about their times!? I’m confused.
1,@TheRabbitHole84 They voluntarily did exactly what I wanted them to do https://t.co/MqOSLaXk7l
1,@TheRabbitHole84 It is media’s control of what to write about in the first place that is far more insidious than having some facts wrong in an article
1,@JoeyMooose Nope
1,I wish the media would stop flattering me all time … it’s a bit much guys ☺️
1,@Chad_Hurley Video too
1,@ShellenbergerMD Interesting
1,As promised https://t.co/Jc1TnAqxAV
1,@PeterDiamandis @cb_doge I ate three times body weight in donuts!
1,@dogeofficialceo Nice
1,They should really get rid of that 100 IQ maximum limit for creating an account on Instagram
1,@boringcompany @TUM_Boring Well done!
1,@ylecun Actually; airplanes used to crash frequently!  Eventually; so many people died that the FAA was created to ensure that commercial aircraft makers &amp; airlines didn’t cut corners on safety.   Now; flying on an airliner in America is super safe.  https://t.co/WCs2IuMyGb
1,@andst7 @aagalloni Good question
1,@Austen @CommunityNotes Critically; Community Notes applies equally to every account on this platform without exception; including world leaders &amp; our biggest advertisers
1,Credit to Tim Sweeney for realizing this before me
1,@Austen Once a writer gets Noted a few times; they usually try a lot harder to be truthful; which greatly amplifies the positive effect of @CommunityNotes
1,@cb_doge True
1,@Scobleizer Some of the AI art is incredible &amp; it keeps getting better!
1,@BillyM2k Your feed is great
1,@SpaceForceCSO @SemperCitiusSDA Thank you for entrusting @SpaceX with this mission
1,@Reuters “Deceptive headline backfires on Reuters”
1,@Rainmaker1973 Can I interest you in a tunnel; perhaps? @boringcompany
1,@buccocapital Whoa
1,@all_in_tok @DavidSacks @MarkWarner Very concerning
1,Great interview on AI
1,@dogeofficialceo @nytimes NY Times is being incredible hypocritical here; as they are super aggressive about forcing everyone to pay *their* subscription
1,@TesLatino @Tesla FSD is getting really good
1,@N__1__7 @Rainmaker1973 Yeah; above ground upside down pyramid should connect to an underground pyramid. Would be sick.
1,Feels like the future
1,Walked whole Cybertruck production line at Giga Texas for several hours earlier today – gonna be awesome!
1,@Rainmaker1973 These are great
1,@unusual_whales True
1,@TrungTPhan Verification of accounts will help a lot. We are adding date of verification to the profile.   Note; only date since paid verification counts; since there was so much corruption in the past with legacy checkmarks.
1,Also; their feed is the Twitter equivalent of diarrhea. It’s unreadable.  They would have far more real followers if they only posted their top articles.   Same applies to all publications.
1,@cb_doge $7 is a small price for freedom
1,@freddiesayers If there were in fact such an epidemic; the White House &amp; every newspaper in the western hemisphere would shout each case from the rooftops!  There isn’t one.
1,@PeterDiamandis What future do you want?
1,@JeffTutorials @nytimes This
1,@ajlamesa Sounds familiar
1,The real tragedy of @NYTimes is that their propaganda isn’t even interesting
1,@BillyM2k @waitbutwhy Billionaires suck lol
1,@alx @GlennKesslerWP @CommunityNotes Tell me this isn’t the best $8 you’ve ever spent 🤣🔥
1,@cb_doge Oh ok; we’ll take it off then
1,@slashdot San Francisco cooked its golden geese. Now the Golden State risks doing the same.  Better to collect the golden eggs forever than eat the goose once.
1,@DrJBhattacharya You were a significant enough to be blacklisted; but allegedly not enough to be verified. They lied. In reality; it was just partisan censorship / propaganda.
1,@Rainmaker1973 The White House is just a small cottage. We need to move on!
1,@Rainmaker1973 We should build a new presidential office in the shape of a giant upside down pyramid!  Sure; they’ve built normal pyramids before; but a giant upside down pyramid? That takes advanced technology.
1,@DavidSacks Our algorithm is obviously horrendous; but it will get better fast and in full view of the public; whose trust we must earn
1,@DrJBhattacharya @ajlamesa The eagerness of English to add foreign words has contributed greatly to its success!  This is a great podcast: https://t.co/ld0DzE0y7j
1,@DrJBhattacharya @ajlamesa How much English is used in Italy? We love adding Italian words to our vocabulary!
1,@DrJBhattacharya If an account is permanently suspended; all its activity is removed
1,@cb_doge Exactly
1,@cb_doge A little sugar is fine
1,@cb_doge Oh … the irony
1,@EvaFoxU Inspiration for the @boringcompany (not a) flamethrower!
1,@JanJekielek @boriquagato Agreed
1,@Supreme_Owl_FTW @ashleevance Extremely concerning; given that it leads to a dystopian future – just walk around downtown SF to see what will happen
1,@ylecun @erikbryn Aerospace safety is overseen by the FAA; because people had had enough of dying due to shoddy manufacturing &amp; maintenance; but there is no agency overseeing AI at all.
1,@park2power @Erdayastronaut @WR4NYGov @_BRCooper Geo direct mission
1,@boriquagato Who is behind these botnets?   Million dollar bounty if convicted.
1,@PeterDiamandis @drmarkhyman I recommend having 1/4 to 1/2 of an epic donut 🍩 It’s diminishing returns after the first few bites.
1,@SciGuySpace More than days away; but hopefully not many weeks away
1,@ashleevance You could literally film a Walking Dead episode unedited in downtown SF.  This is where San Francisco politics leads and Twitter was exporting this self-destructive mind virus to the world.  With some exceptions; other tech companies are still doing so.   Evil in guise of good.
1,@DavidSacks They know they cannot defend what their algorithm actually does; so they will keep it closed
1,@PeterDiamandis Ok fine AI should do fashion it’s awesome
1,@GlennKesslerWP Only thing on fire are Kessler’s pants
1,@gaborgurbacs Steak is great too!
1,@GlennKesslerWP “Incendiary” 🤣🤣 🔥🔥
1,Me after 1 day of not eating sugar https://t.co/BP0dqyvcg1
1,@MuskUniversity Yeah!!
1,@cb_doge @PeterDiamandis @drmarkhyman Somehow; I’m still alive; despite having ice cream since I was a child. It’s a miracle!
1,@PeterDiamandis @drmarkhyman Sorry; that’s just the donut talking
1,@PeterDiamandis @drmarkhyman Also; that doc looks pretty old for someone who’s only age 25
1,@PeterDiamandis @drmarkhyman Sugar is awesome 😎
1,Wait for it …
1,This is most of the recommendation code. In the coming weeks; we will open source literally everything that contributes to showing a tweet; such that the output can be at least roughly approximated.
1,@szymonkopec @petergyang Should be &amp; will be
1,@ZubyMusic Someone should make a movie about that
1,@TitterDaily Avoiding dystopian outcomes is not easy.   The intent is not for the algorithm to be some judgy moral arbiter; but rather that it do its best to inform &amp; entertain.  Trying to maximize unregretted user-minutes seems like the right objective.
1,@TitterDaily It will
1,@sterlingcrispin I will die in America (or Mars if lucky)
1,@BillyM2k Yeah!
1,Don’t Look Up … but AGI instead of comet
1,@ylecun According to my biological NNs; AI existential risk to humanity is non-trivial
1,We live in the most interesting of times
1,@ylecun You really think AI is a single-edged sword?
1,@miketx95 @BillyM2k So are we lol
1,@ShellenbergerMD @ScottPelley @PaulREhrlich Absolutely
1,@AlexEpstein @ScottAdamsSays @60Minutes @ShellenbergerMD @BjornLomborg @BrianGitt @HumanProgress @RitaPanahi @jordanbpeterson Ehrlich despises humanity. Nothing he says should be given the slightest credibility.
1,@jordanbpeterson His “Population Bomb” book might the most damaging anti-human thing ever written
1,@stillgray Mostly accurate tbh

1,@jordanbpeterson Not sure; but after watching some of his talks online; he would not be an obvious choice to play the protagonist in a movie
1,@lexfridman Good list
1,@BriannaWu Thanks for paying me $8
1,@grizzzmint @TheRabbitHole84 Which is; ironically; obviously super racist!
1,Hope you’re having a great day 1 2023!  One thing’s for sure; it won’t be boring.
1,@WholeMarsBlog Agreed; update coming in Jan
1,@jpr007 I’d like to thank the people of Norway again for their incredible support of electric vehicles. Norway rocks!! 🇳🇴
1,@ScottAdamsSays @Mediaite Yeah; this is silly. I love your work!
1,@TimRunsHisMouth @ZaleskiLuke Exactly! I am obviously “moderate wing”; except as viewed by the far left.
1,@pmarca Piketty is a misanthrope
1,@drefanzor @oadegbolamdphd @fahmialalam On the list
1,Sometimes it’s just better to make pizza at home
1,@oadegbolamdphd @fahmialalam Absolutely
1,@hodgetwins @TheBabylonBee Key test for authenticity is how someone is in live back &amp; forth discussion where canned speeches don’t work; eg Twitter Spaces. Has she done anything like that?
1,Unlike likes; bookmarks are private
1,Easy to create folders to bookmark tweets into various categories
1,Twitter has a bookmark function accessible through share button on tweet.   To read bookmarks; tap profile icon.  This obscure UI will be fixed in Jan.
1,@stillgray To the best of my knowledge; I have never met him; nor was I at that Halloween party in Romania
1,@alex_avoigt Please take both of those sentences fully to heart!
1,@MuskUniversity Absolutely
1,@WholeMarsBlog Tesla Megapack (and Powerwall) will make a massive difference to achieving a sustainable energy future for Earth!

1,Feels weird helping make (hopefully good version of) Cyberpunk come true
1,Please consider working at Neuralink!  Short-term: solve brain/spine injuries Long-term: human/AI symbiosis   Latter will be species-level important   Work at either at our Bay Area or Austin locations
1,On Clubhouse tonight at 10pm LA time
1,@Erdayastronaut @TJ_Cooney @lrocket @SpaceX @FelixSchlang @MarcusHouseGame Tom has some great stories about experimenting with premixed O2/CH4 before SpaceX. That is not recommended haha.
1,@Erdayastronaut @TJ_Cooney @lrocket @SpaceX @FelixSchlang @MarcusHouseGame He became a big fan of methane; but was not pushing it initially. That came from me reading about Soviet methane engine tests that got over 380 Isp. At that Isp; a subcooled methane stage gets slightly better delta-V than a hydrogen stage.
1,@TJ_Cooney @lrocket @SpaceX @FelixSchlang @MarcusHouseGame That sounds correct. Tom certainly deserves a lot of credit for his excellent work on those engines! Dean Ono too for Kestrel &amp; Draco.
1,@TJ_Cooney @lrocket @SpaceX @FelixSchlang @MarcusHouseGame Tom is great &amp; was instrumental in developing early versions of Merlin &amp; Kestrel; but not later versions of Merlin or Starship/Raptor
1,@ErcXspace @smvllstvrs T/W will be ~1.5; so it will accelerate unusually fast. High T/W is important for reusable vehicles to make more efficient use of propellant; the primary cost. For expendable rockets; throwing away stages is the primary cost; so optimization is low T/W.

1,@wimgrommen @WSBChairman Indeed. The economy — making useful products &amp; providing great services — is what actually matters.
1,@Iupsychdoctor @AOC @RobinhoodApp TANSTAAFL. Would be better to have small fees than no fees; as latter makes Robinhood beholden to big trading houses. Got to pay the bills somehow. Even Etsy has fees.
1,Here come the shorty apologists Give them no respect Get Shorty

1,@28delayslater Finishing engineering this year; production starts next year. Aiming to have release candidate design drivable late summer. Tri-motor drive system &amp; advanced battery work were important precursors.
1,@PPathole @Grimezsz I made that video!
1,@AOC @RobinhoodApp Absolutely
1,@NASASpaceflight Unlike its aircraft division; which is fine; the FAA space division has a fundamentally broken regulatory structure.   Their rules are meant for a handful of expendable launches per year from a few government facilities. Under those rules; humanity will never get to Mars.
1,The esthetics of Cyberpunk are incredible btw. The interior design is👌.

1,@Tesmanian_com These also have laser links between the satellites; so no ground stations are needed over the poles
1,@teslaownersSV @cleantechnica Sorry for the version confusion. V8.1 is what it should say for FSD. Separate version number for rest of car.

1,@NASASpaceflight Hopefully; early next week
1,@arstechnica @SciGuySpace Given so many other companies are depending on this mission; it is getting even more scrutiny than a Starlink flight
1,Launching many small satellites for a wide range of customers tomorrow. Excited about offering low-cost access to orbit for small companies!
1,@GerberKawasaki They are part of the solution; but require lots of fresh water &amp; land. We may need something that’s ultra-large- scale industrial in 10 to 20 years. For now; by far the top priority is accelerating the transition to a sustainable energy economy.
1,@Erdayastronaut It’s a good path for fully renewable rocket energy; so solves part of problem; but longer chain hydrocarbons than CH4 are needed to be solid at room temp

1,@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Was also thinking that SpaceX Boca should hold fun parties and give tours for the community from time to time
1,@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX I super support public spaces around our production &amp; launch sites; wherever it can be done safely and securely. When covid passes; we will open up our restaurant to the public &amp; figure out ways to allow limited access to the High Bar.
1,@Christo49699922 @sean18743005 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX That too
1,@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX That’s actually our restaurant; but SpaceX is building a futuristic bar at the top of the high bay with 360 degree windows &amp; a glass floor looking down on the rocket factory
1,@techreview And increase fun! Hopefully.
1,@benmezrich Me neither
1,@TonyChoMrMagic @TeslaEnergy One of the best Tesla Solar Roof installations
1,@91demigod No; but maybe one day
1,@PPathole @engineers_feed Yes; that would be the best way to do it. A large solar field or reactor is needed for power; and then some ice mining droids or long maneuvering drills are needed for the H2O. These are probably the trickier bits.
1,@engineers_feed His sick beats https://t.co/8PbsgffzRp
1,@flcnhvy Probably less than a few dozen primary decision-makers. Technically; only three.
1,@Erdayastronaut @lexfridman Or at least the option for verification; so that the public can ascribe more credibility to verified vs unverified accounts
1,Launch underway
1,Btw; critical feedback is always super appreciated; as well as ways to donate money that really make a difference (way harder than it seems)
1,@engineers_feed Indirectly; an electric rocket is possible by using electricity to convert CO2+H2O —&gt; CH4+O2. This will be needed on Mars even for early missions &amp; Earth too over time.
1,@engineers_feed Not to get to orbit; unfortunately. In space; photon emission powered by matter-antimatter annihilation would rock; but that’s more of a long-term solution.
1,@Teslarati @ResidentSponge This will be hard to make; as it isn’t like any other vehicle

1,@newscientist Um; we have giant fusion reactor in the sky that works with no maintenance
1,@comma_ai Tesla Full Self-Driving will work at a safety level well above that of the average driver this year; of that I am confident. Can’t speak for regulators though.
1,@PPathole Dojo isn’t needed; but will make self-driving better. It isn’t enough to be safer than human drivers; Autopilot ultimately needs to be more than 10 times safer than human drivers.

1,@ThatDesignGuy @m_siphiw @moosuraj @Tesla Roughly 95% of parts in Tesla Roadster were unique — not in any other product. Unfortunately; since we started out with the (dumb; in retrospect) goal of simply adapting Lotus Elise to electric; we ended up with a 10% too small sports car that seems kinda like a Lotus.
1,@engineers_feed Very important
1,@teslaownersSV @lexfridman Ok; service might be able to do this. Will check.
1,@teslaownersSV @lexfridman You mean install the external speaker on earlier cars that don’t have it?
1,@GUNMTLM3 @lexfridman No; but definitely this year

1,@wintonARK Strange; if true.   - Tesla already uses iron-phosphate for medium range cars made in our Shanghai factory.  - A monocell is electrochemically impossible; as max voltage is ~100X too low. Maybe they meant cells bonded together; like our structural battery pack?

1,Thanks to everyone who worked so hard to make Tesla successful. My heart goes out to you.
1,@teslaownerssv Indeed
1,@Kristennetten It was a seriously twisted affair; but all’s that ends well.
1,@MKBHD They are; although it’s kind low-key. Tesla Superchargers are being made accessible to other electric cars.

1,♥️ i love all u crazy ppl out there ♥️
1,@BizzzzzyD You have a point (sigh)
1,@pcgamer Great game
1,@flcnhvy Pretty much. The main value of college used to be hanging out; having pseudo intellectual conversations &amp; partying with people your own age. Now; even that’s gone.

1,@teslaownerssv @astonmartin @Tesla He was indeed quite grumpy; but we did not actually know what we were doing; so he had a point
1,@teslaownerssv It will get absurdly good. Tesla AI/Autopilot engineering is awesome! There’s some great AI out there; but can it self-drive while playing Cyberpunk … ?
1,Star Light; Star Bright https://t.co/6CeTAZSXCO
1,@Teslarati @13ericralph31 This is incorrect
1,@pcgamer But it is visually stunning &amp; playability is good
1,@pcgamer A t-shirt being better armor than a Kevlar chest plate doesn’t make sense in the absence of magic. Also; wish there weren’t level-based item limits in a single-player game.
1,@cleantechnica I absolutely support trans; but all these pronouns are an esthetic nightmare
1,@Erdayastronaut @flightclubio The Raptors were well below max thrust or the ship would have blown through the altitude limit. As we hit min throttle point; an engine would shut off.
1,@Erdayastronaut @flightclubio Far from fully loaded; but we were going slow or the ship would have gone crazy high/far with three engines
1,@picot_john @CyberpunkGame It’s a good to great game imo; but improving what may seem like mere surface detail would make it unequivocally great
1,@truth_tesla @Tesmanian_com Perhaps slightly more confident; but it’s essential to view this as output vs time. As with all manufacturing; especially new technology; output will follow an S-curve. Very slow at first; but increasing exponentially; then linear; then logarithmic.
1,@Tesmanian_com Giga Berlin-Brandenburg will be the first to use our new structural pack architecture; 4680 (world’s most advanced cells; made on-site); both front &amp; rear body castings &amp; advanced paint shop. Warning: with so much new technology; production timing is naturally harder to predict.
1,@Dota2funny1 @CyberpunkGame Original Deus Ex was incredible; Human Revolution was also great

1,@RGVaerialphotos It will be real soon
1,@MarcusHouseGame @bcart03 @nextspaceflight @NASASpaceflight Starship legs are one of the hardest problems. Externally mounted legs require shielding; which adds mass. Wider stance adds mass. Shock absorbers add mass. That said; we need better legs.
1,@bcart03 @nextspaceflight @NASASpaceflight Static fire is not risky from build site; but we need to clear the build site for early flights
1,@nextspaceflight @NASASpaceflight Just a static fire tomorrow. Flight no earlier than Wednesday.

1,@flcnhvy @thesheetztweetz Major upgrades are slated for SN15
1,@flcnhvy @thesheetztweetz Many small improvements; but overall similar. Wiring is more robust; engines are more mature; nosecone is sealed better; etc.
1,@thesheetztweetz But that’s why we have SN 9 &amp; SN10
1,@thesheetztweetz Lot of things need to go right; so maybe 1/3 chance
1,Good Starship SN8 static fire! Aiming for first 15km / ~50k ft altitude flight next week. Goals are to test 3 engine ascent; body flaps; transition from main to header tanks &amp; landing flip.
1,@Erdayastronaut @MarcusHouseGame Maybe start on that a year from now. Depends on how Starship progress goes.
1,@RationalEtienne @MarcusHouseGame Not yet
1,@StarshipFairing @MarcusHouseGame Not bad! We will definitely need more engines if we make the cargo bay all propellant; but it’s probably smarter than a whole new shorter external hull.
1,@MarcusHouseGame Rapid &amp; complete rocket reuse; low cost propellant; orbital refilling &amp; propellant production at destination are the four essential elements of making life multiplanetary
1,@PPathole @Teslarati @TeslaRoadTrip We’re still far from simply video in; control out. The biggest game-changer; currently underway at Tesla; is 360 degree; high fps video for labeling; training &amp; inference.

1,@RationalEtienne @heydave7 @philwhln We have quiet a queue of products to build! Better do new Roadster at some point😬.
1,@RationalEtienne @ShyCybertruck Fate loves irony; but hates hypocrisy
1,@flcnhvy Our data center was named Skynet as a joke over 10 years ago. Might have been tempting fate!
1,@heydave7 @philwhln Tesla is a vehicle for creating &amp; producing many useful products
1,@NASASpaceflight Largest cast titanium part in the world. No heat shielding needed.
1,@tobyliiiiiiiiii @SpaceX @NASA @NASA_LSP @NASAJPL @esa Actually; off to the side (so it doesn’t take out the launch mount in bad landing); but with the same arm used to pick up the ship
1,@tobyliiiiiiiiii @SpaceX @NASA @NASA_LSP @NASAJPL @esa Where it should be!
1,@philwhln @heydave7 Because I am not an investor. Tesla is definitely not the only good company; but investing is not what I do. But I always put my own money into companies I help create; otherwise it’d be wrong to ask others to do so.

1,@PPathole @mirojurcevic @TashaARK @Space_Station Exactly
1,@mirojurcevic @TashaARK This is a misperception. SpaceX developed &amp; continues to use lidar for Dragon docking with @Space_Station.   Just pointless imo for self-driving. If you’re going to do active photon generation; use an occlusion penetrating wavelength; like precision radar at ~4mm.
1,@PhilippeCROIZON @SpaceX One day we will fly you on Starship
1,@Peter_J_Beck Well done!
1,@hisdirtremoves @SpaceX I can’t comment on turbopump internal details; but you’re roughly in the ballpark. Wow; rocket turbopumps; especially if oxygen-rich; are insanely hard! Arguably; the hardest mechanical/fluids/combustion problem known to exist.
1,@TashaARK To be clear; this was just an XPeng problem. Other companies in China have not done this.
1,@IsaacLatterell @TashaARK @karpathy Andrej is awesome; but it should be said that we have a very talented Autopilot/AI team at Tesla. Too much credit comes to me &amp; Andrej.

1,@PPathole @xDreamCoding @garyblack00 That is certainly the intention!
1,@garyblack00 The only publicly traded stock I own is Tesla
1,@garyblack00 Wise words from Bogle. The point of companies is products &amp; services. They have no point in &amp; of themselves; nor do these indices. Buy &amp; hold stock in companies where you love the product roadmap; sell where you don’t. https://t.co/yHVQJXTahn
1,@teslaownerssv @AstroJordy @flcnhvy No; just a mild cold. Same with my bro. Def had cov2 though. Pc&lt;20 means viral load of &gt;10 million per mL.
1,@Astronomiaum Life in glass domes at first. Eventually; terraformed to support life; like Earth.
1,@AstroJordy @flcnhvy Yeah
1,@Daywalker_xD @Astronomiaum I was going to say “Sim!”; but that seemed too obvious haha
1,@flcnhvy And cases with high (non-infectious) Ct should quarantine for a few days; while getting another test. Second test determines whether they’re just beginning to get ill or are on the long tail afterwards; where viral fragments exist; but person is not infectious.

1,@peterrhague It’s designed to make life multiplanetary; otherwise extreme overkill for mere Earth sector activity!   Starship fleet mass to orbit per year will be more than 1000 times all current Earth rockets combined; including Falcon. Necessary; for a city on Mars.
1,@Kristennetten @royalsociety More like he gave it his blessing. It was sort of a groundswell of those who believed in the scientific method in London.
1,@westcoastbill Indeed
1,@PPathole @Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Yeah; looks like marginal cost of launch will be less than $1M for more than 100 tons to orbit; so it’s mostly about fixed costs divided by launches per year
1,@speculawyer @Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Exactly
1,@Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Merlin is a strong local maximum design; but kerosene is suboptimal fuel; no matter what you do.   What matters is cost per ton to Mars. CH4 is the only choice imo. Important: O2/CH4 allows OF ratio of ~3.5 vs ~2.5 for kerosene; so ~78% of propellant is oxygen.
1,@parstalberg @josh_bickett @ICannot_Enough @Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Yes; but from a visiting American. Ah; the irony is just too much!!
1,@josh_bickett @ICannot_Enough @Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Yeah; PCR Ct was unequivocal at &lt;20. Doesn’t matter what method you use at that low a cycle threshold.
1,@flcnhvy @LUGG4S1 @pcgamer Maybe making some notable changes. Will wait until figurative &amp; literal dust settles.
1,@ICannot_Enough @Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Pretty close. Definitely feel 💯 if I take DayQuil. Frankly; this was one of the mildest cold/flu experiences I’ve ever had.
1,@LUGG4S1 @pcgamer Avionics cables moving to steel pipe shields &amp; adding water-cooled steel pipes to test pad
1,@Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 The most amazing thing about rocket engines is that they *sometimes* don’t blow up! The amount of power going through them boggles the mind.
1,@pcgamer We should just count the atoms at this point
1,@DJSnM @Erdayastronaut @CharlesNOtrumps @rweb11742 Absolutely. Production/testing of rocket engines is over 90% of the problem. This is true in general. For cars; production is over 99% of the problem. That 1% inspiration is very important; but it’s less than 1% of the pain.
1,@Erdayastronaut @CharlesNOtrumps @rweb11742 Our first Merlin engine design was really bad tbh. Nothing worked well &amp; some parts didn’t work at all. 18 years later &amp; thousands of upgrades make it a great GG cycle engine.

1,@michaelmina_lab Great thread
1,@SamTalksTesla I’m ok; thanks for asking. No symptoms for past few days; apart from fatigue. Unless something changes; would have to say that it simply felt like a mild cold.
1,Launch in 5 minutes
1,@flcnhvy Yeah; with cooling channels integrated into the chamber walls
1,The same propellant is used either for abort or for orbital maneuvering; as one use obviates the other
1,Dragon can also hover &amp; land propulsively; but we use the parachutes for maximum safety https://t.co/Mr7VFIQwWf
1,Thrusters are integrated with spacecraft; enabling abort capability all the way to abort for increased safety
1,@KlotzAdam @PPathole @AstroJordy @erujabidi Yeah; I feel pretty normal. No symptoms right now. Last week; I had symptoms of a minor cold. I’ve had some brutal flu/cold experiences; but this was mild &amp; hopefully over.
1,@PPathole @AstroJordy @erujabidi Doing tests from several different labs; same time of day; administered by RN &amp; am requesting N1 gene PCR cycle threshold. There is no official standard for PCR testing. Not sure people realize this.
1,@PPathole @Mario_Livio Both obv insanely great; too bad they had this pointless argument
1,Astronaut launch today!
1,@Mario_Livio No kids though
1,@Mario_Livio Hell of a wig collection too
1,@michaelmina_lab It would be great if labs could give people this level of granular feedback in their results
1,Worth reading this thread if you’re curious about rona testing
1,@stonkmanup @michaelmina_lab They should be imo. If you get a blood pressure test; they tell you the number; not just if it’s high/not-high. There is not a clear consensus on what Ct value of what cov2 gene constitutes “positive”.
1,@AstroJordy @erujabidi A little up &amp; down. Feels just like a regular cold; but more body achy &amp; cloudy head than coughing/sneezing. DayQuil rocks.
1,@michaelmina_lab In your opinion; at what Ct number for the cov2 N1 gene should a PCR test probably be regarded as positive? If I’m asking the wrong question; what is a better question?
1,@teslaownerssv Cool; but please be super cautious. Expect two steps forward; one back. Lot of new code was merged.
1,@erujabidi Am getting wildly different results from different labs; but most likely I have a moderate case of covid. My symptoms are that of a minor cold; which is no surprise; since a coronavirus is a type of cold.

1,@MrSammy_H @pelagicbird @max_roi @rossy65 Heneghan makes a lot of sense. Hilarious that he has to clarify that he runs the Center for *Evidence-Based* Medicine at Oxford 🤣🤣. General public doesn’t realize quite how much of medicine is subjective or outright witchcraft.
1,@WhatsupFranks The number of PCR amplification cycles required to detect the virus is a rough indicator of your viral load. From what I can gather; you’re probably not infectious above 30 &amp; you probably are below 25. Sound about right?
1,@MrSammy_H @max_roi @rossy65 This a great reference! Worth a read.
1,Case closed https://t.co/pUYiJcAdD6
1,Soon https://t.co/mWOpR7W8kk
1,@PPathole Fwiw; lab I just spoke to thinks below 30 is accurate; 30 to 40 gets dicey &amp; above 40 is bs. Will talk to several more labs. There must be a graph of PCR amplification cycle vs false positive rate somewhere.
1,@RationalEtienne @ryaneshea Note; this is not the spike protein. They don’t consider that reliable.
1,@RationalEtienne @ryaneshea Just spoke directly to a testing lab. Their main PCR search is for the N1 gene; unique to cov2. N3 is also sought; but is generic to other sars viruses. High PCR cycle count *does* give false positives; but they believe accuracy is good below 30 cycles &amp; 40 cycles is their max.
1,@PPathole Strange
1,@ryaneshea Possible explanation for the dramatic decline in cold &amp; flu prevalence vs prior years. If someone comes in with cold/flu symptoms &amp; falsely tests positive for cov2; they will assume they have it; when in fact they simply have some other form of seasonal cold/flu.
1,@ryaneshea From https://t.co/42z7vRPB9c https://t.co/XTSukcc3Tl
1,@dana_e_morgan Sure is
1,Would be great to hear from people who know a lot about the PCR testing industry. What’s the approximate false positive rate; all things considered; for cov2 PCR tests?
1,@ClareCraigPath Interesting
1,@john_beans @DirtyTesla Interesting
1,What is the general population (no knowledge of symptoms) accuracy of a sars-cov2 PCR test &amp; is it possible to generate a false positive if you simply run enough cycles?
1,@PPathole @cleantechnica A good PCR test should identify if I have the cov2 spike proteins; although I have heard some low accuracy numbers for those too. Hard to get a straight answer.   False positives will roughly scale with # of tests &amp; daily test rate has gone ballistic: https://t.co/Pv6s71jZQo
1,@justpaulinelol @cleantechnica Mild sniffles &amp; cough &amp; slight fever past few days. Right now; no symptoms; although I did take NyQuil.
1,@cleantechnica Technically; I tested positive; then negative twice; then positive again; so “Elon Musk Tests Negative for Covid” is an equally correct title. The “rapid antigen test” from BD seems to be about as useful as a flipping a coin.
1,The carousel turns ever faster
1,@ajtourville Exactly
1,@JaneidyEve Symptoms of a typical cold. Nothing unusual so far.
1,@BLKMDL3 If it’s happening to me; it’s happening to others. I’m getting PCR tests from separate labs. Results will take about 24 hours.
1,Something extremely bogus is going on. Was tested for covid four times today. Two tests came back negative; two came back positive. Same machine; same test; same nurse. Rapid antigen test from BD.
1,@austinbarnard45 Burst disk worked; so vehicle appears to be ok. We’ll have to swap out at least one of the engines.
1,@tobyliiiiiiiiii @SpacePadreIsle @austinbarnard45 Maybe melted an engine preburner or fuel hot gas manifold. Whatever it is caused pneumatics loss. We need to design out this problem.
1,@austinbarnard45 We lost vehicle pneumatics. Reason unknown at present. Liquid oxygen header tank pressure is rising. Hopefully triggers burst disk to relieve pressure; otherwise it’s going to pop the cork.

1,@amyceskridge Neuralink won’t overclock the brain; it will transfer processing to the supercomputer extension of your brain. This is basically what you do when you use a smartphone or computer; but a Neuralink will have orders of magnitude faster input &amp; output; especially latter.
1,@flcnhvy @PPathole @cleantechnica We rewrote all labeling software for 4D. Very different from labeling single photos. Dojo won’t contribute for about a year. It’s mostly a generalized NN training computer; but benchmark we’re tracking is frames/second. Must beat next gen GPU/TPU clusters or it’s pointless.
1,@PPathole @cleantechnica Version 1 is about a year away
1,@RenataKonkoly @SpaceNews_Inc It would appear that their calculations were incorrect
1,@SpaceNews_Inc China understands the profound importance of reusability. The era of expendable rockets will soon be over.
1,@cleantechnica Good explanation. 4D is essential for dynamically occluded objects; especially in large intersections with dense vehicle &amp; pedestrian traffic. Frame rate &amp; latency from frame to wheel vector change also important.
1,The Phantom of the Opera  Is here … inside your mind
1,@PPathole Just looking for problem-solvers who get things done with a high sense of urgency. Don’t care if or where they went to school.
1,When sending your resume; please describe a few of the hardest problems you solved &amp; exactly how you solved them
1,A New Banner is needed Neither hard left nor right
1,@PPathole Another fine day in the simulation …
1,@Nereide Faraday invented the electric motor; Tesla the (commutator-free; three-phase) AC induction motor; in other words; a useful electric motor
1,@Nereide Maxwell was amazing. Should have more recognition. Tesla Motors; Inc.; was almost called Faraday; as it took until late 2004/2005 to buy the trademark from a guy who had had it since 1995.
1,420 is ten times better than 42
1,@LinusTech @SpaceXStarlink @SpaceX Awaiting approval from Canadian authorities
1,Recruiting ace engineers for Giga Berlin! Will interview in person tomorrow on site. Send resume to 25Guns@Tesla.com.
1,@Chad_Hurley @realDonaldTrump @kanyewest Stop being a chad
1,@Chad_Hurley @realDonaldTrump @kanyewest Uh … Chad wtf
1,@TechAmazing Einstein was great; but did not succeed at engineering (and he tried)
1,@jtrevorchapman Yeah; that will be relatively easy; as so few users out in the ocean
1,@ICannot_Enough @ZainRaz4 @vincent13031925 @JonErlichman Yes; although I didn’t expect the stock to rise so much so soon. The reason for the stock options is that they’re needed to help pay for humanity to get to Mars in 10 to 20 years.
1,@FutureJurvetson @PPathole Super appreciate your support; Steve! That convertible loan gave us 6 months of runway. Fortunately; Daimler invested $50M in May 2009; 5 months later.
1,@ZainRaz4 @vincent13031925 @JonErlichman Closest we got was about a month. The Model 3 ramp was extreme stress &amp; pain for a long time — from mid 2017 to mid 2019. Production &amp; logistics hell.
1,@vincent13031925 @JonErlichman I put in my last money; even though I thought we would still fail. But; it was either that or certain death for Tesla. Extremely difficult to raise money for an electric car startup (considered super quirky back then); while stalwarts like GM &amp; Chrysler were going bankrupt.
1,@JonErlichman That funding round completed 6pm on Christmas Eve in 2008. Last hour of last day possible; as investors were leaving town that night &amp; we were 3 days away from bankruptcy. I put in all money I had; didn’t own a house &amp; had to borrow money from friends to pay rent. Difficult time.
1,@PPathole Lowering Starlink terminal cost; which may sound rather pedestrian; is actually our most difficult technical challenge
1,@itshamzahkhan As soon as we get regulatory approval. Hopefully; around middle of next year.
1,@thesheetztweetz Right now; it takes about 5 mins to set up; but; with future improvements; probably less than 3 mins. No technical knowledge needed. Just point at open sky &amp; plug in!
1,@kjell_arne @flcnhvy Canada and Norway are next after we get US out of early beta!
1,@enn_nafnlaus @flcnhvy Didn’t realize that was possible. No problem if there’s a way get current design Cybertruck approved in Europe!
1,@flcnhvy As soon as we get country approval. This is required for each country individually; as no EU-wide approval system exists. Probably start receiving final (there are many steps) approvals around Feb/March.
1,Several thousand more Starlink beta participation invitations going out this week
1,@LouisWFerreira New design is better with many minor tweaks. Even the small details matter.
1,@engineers_feed Haha
1,Very close to actual expected flight!
1,@Nigel_Lockyer I could not be more excited about the new supercollider! That said; while it is considerably larger; I don’t think it necessarily requires all that much incremental engineering.
1,@WholeMarsBlog @steezyysosa @AustinTeslaClub @JoeTegtmeyer @peterdog15 @TXTerafactory @Terafactorytx @lqdchkn @jd_average @EliBurton_ Sure; maybe in a month or so
1,@steezyysosa @AustinTeslaClub @JoeTegtmeyer @peterdog15 @TXTerafactory @Terafactorytx @lqdchkn @jd_average @EliBurton_ Well; it’s basically a tank from the future that’s road-legal; so yeah
1,@AustinTeslaClub @JoeTegtmeyer @peterdog15 @TXTerafactory @Terafactorytx @lqdchkn @jd_average @EliBurton_ Tesla Texas team is making great progress! Giga Texas factory will be an asskicker.
1,Penguin Random House 😴 should change the name to Random Penguin🔥
1,@austinbarnard45 Sure; although it might be quite a short livestream! Lot can go wrong; but we’ll provide video; warts &amp; all. You will see every frame that we do.
1,@FNarolles @TGMetsFan98 This is what matters most
1,@Erdayastronaut @KlotzAdam @NASASpaceflight We’ve tested a sub-scale version in a wind tunnel with active aero closing the loop for stability; so it will probably work at scale; but reality tends to bite you on the ass
1,@RGVaerialphotos Lord of the …
1,@TGMetsFan98 @KlotzAdam @NASASpaceflight @Erdayastronaut Yeah. Although; if it fails right at the end; some landing pad repair will be needed to fill in the crater.
1,@NASASpaceflight @Erdayastronaut But; a RUD right off launch pad is also possible. Fortunately; SN9 is almost ready.
1,@NASASpaceflight @Erdayastronaut Stable; controlled descent with body flaps would be great. Transferring propellant feed from main to header tanks &amp; relight would be a major win.
1,@teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @TesLatino Every 5 to 10 days
1,@Kristennetten @teslaownersSV @TesLatino Faults will never be zero; but at some point the probability of a fault will be far lower than that of the average human
1,@teslaownersSV @TesLatino We measure this primarily in intervention probability. This update addressed several issues; resulting in perhaps ~1/3 fewer interventions. Many of the improvements consist of fixing silly bugs vs grand eureka moments. True for most beta releases in my experience.
1,@TesLatino Thanks to a great Autopilot/AI team working super hard!   Doing “neural nets” without testing them against reality has led some groups to overestimate what they’re doing. Reality is the hardest sim.
1,@auchenberg Latency will improve significantly soon. Bandwidth too.
1,@teslaownersSV This build should be noticeably better with interventions
1,@teslaownersSV @toadmeister I’ve spent more than half my life in California &amp; love the state. But; frankly; I think CA has the winning-for-too-long problem.   Like a sports team with many championships; it is increasingly difficult to avoid complacency &amp; a sense of entitlement.
1,@toadmeister And … Sweden is still right with zero deaths Oct 29 https://t.co/b0LyGOtobI
1,@TOCNewYorkState True. Also; fewer heart attacks; as way easier to pump blood in 37% gravity.
1,@MalekKhelifi24 @9inety6Prince @engineers_feed Now we’re talking. Also; Stephenson 2-18 is in the constellation Scrotum haha.
1,@WholeMarsBlog Accurate
1,@bluemoondance74 @SpacePadreIsle Some challenges with high winds. Looks like Sunday for static fire.

1,@ThatDudeShannon @pcgamer FEAR 1 with modern graphics &amp; sound would rock
1,@ZZCOOL @pcgamer All games in this thread are far scarier &amp; more creatively so than any horror movie
1,@pcgamer FEAR 2 is best imo. Also Dead Space 2. They will haunt your dreams.
1,@jgrano305 @flcnhvy To the best of my knowledge; literally zero equipment was usable without major repairs or upgrades.   Most of the factory had no equipment at all! Even light bulbs were missing in some areas.  GM &amp; Toyota took everything that worked &amp; moved it to their other factories.
1,@flcnhvy All that was left were broken bots &amp; equipment hardly worth the scrap metal value. But we scrounged up spare parts; fixed the trusty old bots &amp; brought the factory back to life.
1,@flcnhvy And there were actually zero employees in the factory after GM/Toyota left. They took all good equipment &amp; sold most of rest for scrap. It looked apocalyptic inside.
1,@ajtourville Bettern nothin or ur 💰 back!
1,@HyperChangeTV Tesla team has done great work!
1,@HyperChangeTV Well; tbh; our capex efficiency in 2017 was trash 😬

1,@WorldAndScience Critical to humanity’s future
1,Congratulations SpaceX Team!
1,@TesLatino Mine is a few days ahead
1,@EliBurton_ @teslaownersSV Sure; it could be an option in settings
1,@teslaownersSV Visualization will tone down significantly for production. These are intentionally strident colors.
1,@Erdayastronaut @tobyliiiiiiiiii @austinbarnard45 @SuperclusterHQ Sure
1,@Erdayastronaut @tobyliiiiiiiiii @austinbarnard45 @SuperclusterHQ I’m in Boca every week; so maybe we could talk then. Given that Starship is not exactly subtle; this is more of a design clarification to match what people can already see.
1,@tobyliiiiiiiiii @austinbarnard45 @SuperclusterHQ Good point. Probably next week in form of a written piece on SpaceX website.
1,@austinbarnard45 @SuperclusterHQ Great pics! That we now have the beginnings of a Starship production system is most meaningful.
1,@WholeMarsBlog Yup. With beta updates; there’ll be a lot of 2 steps fwd; 1 step back situations; but pace of improvement will be extremely fast.
1,@bart_sanders Working on it. Also needs to be able fart at other cars on command.
1,@SpacePadreIsle Starship is coming together!
1,Price change is pushed to Thursday next week. Applies only to US for now. One week clock will start in other countries as beta is released. FSD monthly rental will also be available sometime next year.
1,@austinbarnard45 There will be a 360 deg glass Star Bar (name tbd) at top of high bay
1,@DMC_Ryan Well; we have said many times that the price will rise as the product functionality improves. How much time do you think we should give?
1,@StephenKing Agreed. Are these performance tires?
1,@SpaceX Just a small-seeming issue with loss of upper stage camera. Probably nothing serious; but standing down to re-examine whole vehicle just in case.
1,@flcnhvy Sure
1,Now that Tesla FSD beta is out in limited release; FSD price (new or upgrade) will go up by ~$2k on Monday
1,@TeslaGong @PPathole @teslaownersSV @tesla_raj As soon as we complete testing &amp; regulators approve. So many different traffic signs; rules &amp; languages around world; not to mention driving on left side of road! Also; a long &amp; challenging road lies ahead getting to high 9’s reliability (way beyond human).
1,@teslaownersSV @tesla_raj Haha
1,@Teslarati Dependent on proving high safety
1,@WholeMarsBlog Not intentional! We just wanted to show that you could theoretically convert the entire US vehicle fleet to electric using only the lithium in Nevada; a single state. Tesla will do lithium mining only as needed. We also found a way to extract lithium using NaCl (table salt).
1,@Erdayastronaut Cold gas for now; hot later
1,@Rubix161 I mean; ya gotta have a tiki bar …
1,Starship nosecone; high bay &amp; tiki bar https://t.co/9qXYxMMIUj
1,@Erdayastronaut After it gets to orbit a few times
1,@Erdayastronaut Got a little melty tbh :)
1,@Erdayastronaut Those engines could go 300 bar; but would be dicey. Pushing it for near-term tests doesn’t achieve anything; but I’m confident Raptor will do 300 bar for orbital flights.
1,@Erdayastronaut Raptor has now run for 90 secs at 300 bar chamber pressure before encountering issues. 210 mT-F sea level operating thrust seems achievable with no major changes.   R-Boost variant is aiming for 300 ton thrust at 300 bar with same nozzle exit area. Will need bigger pumps.
1,FSD beta rollout happening tonight. Will be extremely slow &amp; cautious; as it should.
1,Data from 3 engine Starship static fire this morning looks good. Proceeding with nosecone mate.
1,@PPathole @toadmeister Yes. We also have to consider population life-months lost from lockdowns &amp; other restrictions vs life-months lost from any given disease.
1,@juanjacobs @jwangARK Firmware is probably a slightly more accurate description; but yes
1,@PPathole @flyerandyp @mojosusan Mobi-C has too much mobility; fusion has too little. We need Mobi-D haha.
1,@flyerandyp @mojosusan Actually; it’s my neck … https://t.co/2vCoAxsrV3
1,@flyerandyp @mojosusan Maybe I can be helpful. Had Mobi-C disc put in at C5-C6; however 1st surgery failed to remove bone spur sticking into my spinal cord. 2nd surgery took care of it. Recommend using Yelp or other online reviews of doctors. Effectiveness varies widely.
1,@jwangARK Pretty accurate. It’s not so much DNA sequencing as it is using synthetic DNA/RNA to fix bugs in our code &amp; inform immune system what to attack.
1,@SamTalksTesla London to Beijing would be cool
1,@SamTalksTesla Wow; that would be quite a trip!
1,@CiNoTpyrC That’s my kid haha
1,@TechAmazing Looks like snoopy
1,@Tesmanian_com Current production is slightly better
1,@bamtheteslaman1 @cleantechnica Doesn’t seem to be any life in this solar system. Maybe under the ice of Europa or extremophile bacteria below the surface of Mars. Worth reading: https://t.co/ym0d53HgyS
1,@cleantechnica Very creative
1,@flcnhvy That free fusion reactor in the sky conveniently converts ~4 million tons of mass into energy every second. We just need to catch an extremely tiny amount of it to power all of civilization.
1,@Kristennetten @teslaownersSV You never know
1,@PPathole After
1,@WhatsupFranks @kimpaquette Also; system should autodelete old data automatically by default
1,@UniverCurious Table in tension

1,@flcnhvy @WholeMarsBlog @Kristennetten @boringcompany @Tesla It’s still there; but focus is Vegas &amp; Prufrock; our new tunneling machine
1,@AstroJordy @Kristennetten @boringcompany @Tesla For sure
1,@WholeMarsBlog @Kristennetten @boringcompany @Tesla Maybe a month or so. Some finishing touches need to be done on the stations.
1,@Kristennetten @boringcompany @Tesla We simplified this a lot. It’s basically just Teslas in tunnels at this point; which is way more profound than it sounds.
1,@PlayOverwatch Sweet …
1,@antonkanerva Yes. Everything is slow to a phased array antenna.
1,@lexfridman Nice
1,“What is love? Baby don’t hurt me.”— Winston Churchill
1,@PlayOverwatch @twomad Or maybe 2 weak turrets to allow more strategic degrees of freedom
1,@PlayOverwatch @twomad Please buff Torb’s turret!
1,@twomad Um … yes
1,@teslaownersSV I have Goosebumps 2 merch. Not sure how tbh.
1,🤘 The Illuminaughty 🤘
1,@ChotiHaque @BillGates @DougStanhope @bobdylan @charltonbrooker @EricIdle @JimCarrey @JohnCleese @sapinker Knee deep
1,@chipro Yeah
1,@WR4NYGov At least success is in the set of all possible outcomes this time!
1,@bad_at_life @WholeMarsBlog Diess is doing his best to move in the right direction; but he’s in a tough position with so many constituencies to please. No way to make everyone happy.
1,@flcnhvy Good grief! SpaceX is getting zero money for this. Starship is designed to carry people &amp; cargo around Earth (also to moon &amp; Mars). Vast majority of use will be civilian. It’s just like an airline in space. All airlines sometimes carry military cargo; but ~99% is civilian.
1,@Teslarati With FSD; we got stuck in a lot of local maximums; which wasn’t clear until we hit the ceiling. This time; it’s right.
1,@RationalEtienne @28delayslater Thank you; much more accurate haha
1,@28delayslater This graph appears to be upside down
1,@Teslarati Sheer magnitude of the entire production system is hard to appreciate. Almost every element of production is &gt;75% automated. Only wire harnesses &amp; general assembly; which are &lt;10% of production costs; are primarily manual.
1,@TeslaClubIN @cleantechnica Will release order configurator probably in Jan
1,@cleantechnica Limited FSD beta releasing on Tuesday next week; as promised. This will; at first; be limited to a small number of people who are expert &amp; careful drivers.
1,@shortword @jwangARK The SoC’s sync with each other 20 to 30 times/sec; exchanging output of NNs that should be in harmony; like a symphony; so it’s fairly obvious when one is discordant
1,@jwangARK Tesla FSD computer’s dual SoCs function like twin engines on planes — they each run different neural nets; so we do get full use of 144 TOPS; but there are enough nets running on each to allow the car to drive to safety if one SoC (or engine in this analogy) fails.
1,@jwangARK Accurate analysis. Quite a few  ego/intelligence&gt;&gt;1 people in your comment thread haha. Neither MobilEye nor Nvidia; which are certainly good companies; could meet any of our capability; schedule; cost or power requirements.
1,@OhioTesla @JenDunlap_ @Tesla @CARandDRIVER @teslaownersSV @Teslarati @ElectrekCo Glad Jen is safe!
1,@slashdot Uh ok; here we go …
1,@Teslarati I don’t think this is accurate
1,@Tesmanian_com Even if half that amount; it’s still a big deal!
1,@MariaBartiromo @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @JeffBezos @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness I have seen no evidence of an advanced civilization visiting Earth. Fuzzy pics that are worse than a 7/11 security cam frame grab don’t count!
1,@electricfuture5 We face a tough dichotomy of applying resources to the old architecture or applying them to the new. It’s not a question of money. If there was a “great engineer” factory; we would place a large order! Unfortunately; great engineers are very rare. This is solved in the FSD build.
1,@flcnhvy Definitely
1,@enn_nafnlaus Exactly. He plays the “poor inventor” card; but was rich all along &amp; invented nothing (as far as I know). I went down to zero cash or sellable assets in 2008/2009; had no house &amp; had to borrow money from friends to pay rent.
1,@enn_nafnlaus There are sketchy edits to Tesla wiki that whitewash Eberhard’s problems/glorify his role. Pretty odd. I was interim CEO/co-CEO from July 2007. Michael Marks was co-CEO for ~Q4 2007 &amp; Ze’ev Drori for Q1 to ~Q3 2008. After Q3 2008 financing round bust; no choice but to be CEO.
1,@enn_nafnlaus When Eberhard was fired from the Tesla CEO role in mid 2007 for providing false information to me &amp; the board; no one left with him. That says it all.
1,@Carrenimfa Interesting
1,@Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @PelleBrannvall @Neopork85 @Caspar_Stanley @ErcXspace @MarcusHouseGame @FelixSchlang @C_Bass3d @nickhenning3d @SpaceX @BocaChicaGal SpaceX/Tesla metallurgy &amp; new materials team is next-level
1,@Erdayastronaut I have that exact art on the wall of the place I stay in Boca Chica!
1,@RationalEtienne @toadmeister Yes; failure to protect nursing homes was a major mistake (happened in most countries). Herd immunity for vast majority of people &amp; quarantine vulnerable was right though imo.
1,@toadmeister Sweden was right https://t.co/bzc2lFDjZQ
1,@Erdayastronaut @PelleBrannvall @flcnhvy @Neopork85 @Caspar_Stanley @ErcXspace @MarcusHouseGame @FelixSchlang @C_Bass3d @nickhenning3d @SpaceX There are sensitive elements; but they’re on the inside. Also; a good telephoto lens will be able to capture what I’ve posted. And yeah; anyone who can reverse engineer what I’ve posted doesn’t need to reverse engineer!
1,@Teslarati Great work by SpaceX valve engineering &amp; production!
1,@flcnhvy @Neopork85 @Caspar_Stanley @ErcXspace @MarcusHouseGame @FelixSchlang @C_Bass3d @nickhenning3d @SpaceX It might be used in some areas. ITAR laws prevent us from being too specific about solutions.
1,@Neopork85 @Caspar_Stanley @ErcXspace @MarcusHouseGame @FelixSchlang @C_Bass3d @nickhenning3d @SpaceX Tiles will be on hot side of flaps too. A very tough problem is sealing the moving flap to body joint without melting or shredding the seal.
1,@ID_AA_Carmack Compilers need to improve imo. Most type; pointer (or other memory) problems can be detected at compile time or disambiguated by asking the user.
1,@RGVaerialphotos @SpaceX I’m proud to say that that nose is pointier than it needs to be haha
1,@SDG2030 @anandmahindra @MetniGeorges @ErikSolheim @berniehollywood Norway leads the world
1,@NASASpaceflight Passed cryo proof
1,@ajtourville Yeah; it’s not a contest. Advanced casting crushes best-case 3D printing; but casting doesn’t work well for complex enclosed volumes &amp; high strength or high temp alloys.
1,@Astro_FarmerBob @astro_Pettit @AstroKomrade @AstroAnnimal Great pics!
1,@johnkrausphotos @Patreon @SuperclusterHQ @SpaceX Maybe this should be the flag of Mars
1,@TashaARK Additive manufacturing of parts is still far too costly for cars; but can rapidly create tooling to accelerate pace of innovation.   It’s already sensible for rocket engine parts. To the best of our knowledge; SpaceX is 2 or 3 years ahead of other companies in use of additive.
1,@RenataKonkoly @franktinsley @ankitXupta @TashaARK Pretty much; but I think it may end on a high note
1,@EVHQ2 @TashaARK Meant to say that it should be fixed in the latest wide release. Won’t need to wait for FSD.
1,@EVHQ2 @TashaARK It should be
1,@franktinsley @ankitXupta @TashaARK Exactly. We barked up that tree for way too long (sigh). Gives a false sense of victory being close — a tantalizing local maximum — but reality is just too messy &amp; weird. Our new system is capable of driving in locations we never seen even once.
1,@PicklePunchD @PPathole @TashaARK Yes; we will play sexy snake jazz 🤣
1,@PPathole @TashaARK Yeah; provided we do our metal gear snake autocoupler
1,@TashaARK Waymo is impressive; but a highly specialized solution. The Tesla approach is a general solution. The latest build is capable of zero intervention drives. Will release limited beta in a few weeks.
1,@akidesir @Kristennetten Yeah; we could put in a setting allowing it to drop as low as 5%
1,@ErcXspace @SpaceX @Erdayastronaut @MarcusHouseGame @FelixSchlang Great render. Note; there will need to be an arm that lifts booster to launch stand &amp; ship to booster.
1,@Kristennetten Mimecraft
1,@ICannot_Enough @TeslaTested Autopilot team is making great progress. Reality sure is complicated!
1,@ErcXspace @MarcusHouseGame @brendan2908 @BocaChicaGal @NASASpaceflight Aspiring to have no flame diverter in Boca; but this could turn out to be a mistake

1,@IheartTesla @alex_avoigt @mike_zimon @WholeMarsBlog Had the most amazing kebab ever just outside of Tacheles. Too bad that place got torn down. It was awesome.
1,@TribeHoh @SpaceX @WAStateCommerce You’re most welcome!
1,@brendan2908 @BocaChicaGal @NASASpaceflight High bay should be finished (except for the giant gantry crane) within a few weeks. Super Heavy stacking should begin around then.
1,@alex_avoigt @mike_zimon @WholeMarsBlog That looks tasty!
1,@tesladri @ChananBos @raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog The crash absorption rails can be cut off &amp; replaced with a bolted part for collision repair
1,@ICannot_Enough @WholeMarsBlog Sandy Munro understands engineering
1,@flcnhvy @teslaownersSV @raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog That would be like licensing Battlestar Galactica. Actually building continuously evolving gargantuan factories is the hard part. Lots of people who worked at Tesla Gigafactories now work at competitors; but none of those companies have made one.
1,@teslaownersSV @raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog Yes; the Gigafactory is the hardest &amp; most critical product
1,@ChananBos @raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog Battery pack will be a bonded structure with cells providing shear transfer between steel upper &amp; lower face sheets; eliminating most of the center body parts while providing better torsional rigidity &amp; improved polar moment or inertia. This is a *major* breakthrough.
1,@raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog But now we understand production much better. It will be our primary competitive advantage long-term.
1,@raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog Even GM &amp; Chrysler went bankrupt in 2009. Ford and Tesla are the only US car companies that have avoided bankruptcy.
1,@raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog The Model 3 production ramp was sheer agony for two years; but that was do or die for Tesla. No US car company has reached high volume production with sustained free cash flow in ~100 years. Hundreds of car startups all died or were absorbed for peanuts by big three.
1,@EvaFoxU @WholeMarsBlog Bringing a new product to volume production is 1% inspiration &amp; 99% perspiration. You do still need that critical seed of inspiration; but it’s fun &amp; takes ~100 people. Production takes &gt;10;000 people &amp; hurts like hell until the gigantic cybernetic collective runs smoothly.
1,@skorusARK Marginal cost of Starship mass to orbit should be well under $100/kg. Fully burdened cost depends on flight rate.
1,@WholeMarsBlog Prototypes are a piece of cake; but high volume production of a new technology is extremely hard. Takes much longer than people think to climb the production S-curve. I can’t emphasize enough that production is by *far* the hard part.
1,@WholeMarsBlog We do expect to make heavy use of LFP for medium range cars &amp; stationary storage
1,@WholeMarsBlog Berlin will use 4680 cell with structural battery pack &amp; front &amp; rear single piece castings. Also; a new paint system.   Lot of new technology will happen in Berlin; which means significant production risk. Fremont &amp; Shanghai will transition in ~2 years when new tech is proven.
1,@AstroJordy @WholeMarsBlog They are
1,@WholeMarsBlog I do so wish that more companies would put down their spreadsheets for a moment and focus on making products that move your heart
1,@PPathole @klod_ua @Erdayastronaut @TrevorMahlmann @johnkrausphotos @Mike_Seeley 7 bar absolute; which is fine for flight. This was a proof test; rather than a burst test. We’ll hopefully fix the leak today &amp; retest.
1,@klod_ua @Erdayastronaut @TrevorMahlmann @johnkrausphotos @Mike_Seeley Cryo pressure test succeeded; but a small leak opened up near the engine mounts; possibly due to differential shrinking
1,@Erdayastronaut @TrevorMahlmann @johnkrausphotos @Mike_Seeley One of the best shots ever!
1,@SamTalksTesla @SpaceX Much sooner
1,@mdcainjr @SpaceX @45thSpaceWing @NASA Great photo!
1,@DirtyTesla @SpaceX It will soon
1,@flcnhvy @alvianchoiri We’re not seeing notable differences yet. I think the boosters could probably do 100+ reflights. Some of the (small) composite helium tanks would need to be replaced. Maybe turbopump hot sections.
1,@PPathole @alvianchoiri Roughly a week or two turnaround is all that’s needed to meet max launch demand. Starship Super Heavy is designed for reflight in less than an hour.
1,@alvianchoiri Ahem; yes; it was the 3rd flight of this booster &amp; 3rd flight for active half of fairing. Aiming for 10+ flights of booster &amp; fairing by end of next year.
1,4th flight &amp; landing for this booster
1,5 minutes from launch. Looks good so far.
1,@cleantechnica So crazy to subsidize pollution! This is not good for people; especially in dense cities with heavy traffic; where your air intake is jammed up against another car’s exhaust pipe.
1,@SciGuySpace It’s a step in the right direction; but they should really aim for full reusability by 2026. Larger rocket would also make sense for literal economies of scale. Goal should be to minimize cost per useful ton to orbit or it will at best serve a niche market.
1,Turn volume to 11 &amp; play Powerglide in your Tesla   https://t.co/l07Yc02P7g
1,@teslaownersSV FSD will solve these issues
1,Music volume on a Tesla goes to 11; because it’s louder than 10  https://t.co/ab5hAMo3EN
1,@Kristennetten @flcnhvy One of my favorite writers. Foundation is tough to make into a movie; but has outstanding potential.
1,Rewatched Young Frankenstein this weekend. Still awesome. Ovaltine? https://t.co/WiMdyFSuiq
1,@flcnhvy The remake has the potential to be great. I kinda liked the original tbh; but it’s possible to take it up a level.
1,Hollywood should just start with the sequel &amp; skip the original; because financials
1,@cleantechnica This article is wildly incorrect about lithium battery costs by a factor of 5 or more presently &amp; 10X long-term
1,@SamTalksTesla @teslaownersSV @PPathole @RationalEtienne @stevenmarkryan @Kristennetten @WholeMarsBlog Pretty wild; considering that Exxon was the most valuable company in the word when we went public 10 years ago
1,New SpaceX droneship will be called “A Shortfall of Gravitas”
1,Nothing can escape gravity; not even black holes (and they really tried!)
1,@ID_AA_Carmack Would be cool to put yourself in the mind of the car while it’s driving
1,@Model3teslaJ Coming soon
1,Call of Booty; great game
1,@teslaownersSV @SpaceX Vector-space bird’s eye view coming with FSD
1,@PPathole @SpaceX Unexpected pressure rise in the turbomachinery gas generator
1,@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX All of that and more. We’re doing a broad review of launch site; propulsion; structures; avionics; range &amp; regulatory constraints this weekend. I will also be at the Cape next week to review hardware in person.
1,@alandail @SpaceX Exactly
1,@SpaceX We will need to make a lot of improvements to have a chance of completing 48 launches next year!
1,@lexfridman I agree with Lex
1,@Mike94160775 @Tesla @ElectrekCo @Teslarati Glad you’re ok!
1,@Sofiaan @Tesla Haha
1,@amoghbhushan @TeslaClubIN @WholeMarsBlog @MKBHD Thanks for waiting!
1,@TeslaClubIN @WholeMarsBlog @MKBHD Next year for sure
1,@tobyliiiiiiiiii @RationalEtienne @SPEXcast @William_M_Brown @PPathole @thesheetztweetz @waEMD @SpaceX @SpaceXStarlink @WANationalGuard Oh yeah; Starship update coming in about 3 weeks. The design has coalesced. What is presented will actually be what flies to orbit as V1.0 with almost no changes.
1,@RationalEtienne @SPEXcast @William_M_Brown @PPathole @thesheetztweetz @waEMD @SpaceX @SpaceXStarlink @WANationalGuard High frequency lasers are the way to go for sure
1,@SPEXcast @William_M_Brown @RationalEtienne @PPathole @thesheetztweetz @waEMD @SpaceX @SpaceXStarlink @WANationalGuard Great
1,@William_M_Brown @RationalEtienne @PPathole @thesheetztweetz @waEMD @SpaceX @SpaceXStarlink @WANationalGuard Brownsville is quite far south; so probably 3 months or so for good connectivity — needs several more Starlink launches. I’m using it at the little house I rent in the area. Definitely not good there yet.
1,@PPathole @thesheetztweetz @waEMD @SpaceX @SpaceXStarlink @WANationalGuard Average latency will improve as more satellites launch (directly above you more frequently) &amp; more ground stations are deployed. As we’re able to put more ground stations on roofs of server centers; legacy Internet latency will be zero.
1,@tobyliiiiiiiiii @RationalEtienne @PPathole @thesheetztweetz @waEMD @SpaceX @SpaceXStarlink @WANationalGuard Very soon for higher latitudes like Seattle
1,@RationalEtienne @PPathole @thesheetztweetz @waEMD @SpaceX @SpaceXStarlink @WANationalGuard Yes; Starlink is designed to enable competitive gaming
1,@PPathole @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @BocaChicaGal @TheFavoritist Probably 5 or 6 with an optimized tanker; although filling up the ship in orbit isn’t required for Mars; so 4 is possible
1,@thesheetztweetz @waEMD @SpaceX @SpaceXStarlink @WANationalGuard Starlink will be a revolution in connectivity; especially for remote regions or for emergency services when landlines are damaged
1,@WholeMarsBlog @MKBHD Yeah
1,@AdlanBogatyryov @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @BocaChicaGal @TheFavoritist Great letter! It will be increasingly difficult to see Starlink satellites; as we’re actively working with the astronomer community to ensure that even the most sensitive telescopes are fine &amp; scientific progress is not impeded.
1,@Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @BocaChicaGal @TheFavoritist The ship rings are thicker than they need to be (for now); so same thickness works for booster &amp; ship for hoop stress. Booster lower tank will have longitudinal stiffeners to prevent buckling.
1,@MKBHD It’s next-level
1,@officialalishap @flcnhvy @Tesla Glad to hear your Mom is ok
1,@Zshauladventure @NASAKennedy @ulalaunch @SpaceX @NatReconOfc Good to see. Inspiring for future of space!
1,@somi_teslagirl @Model3Owners @FutureJurvetson @CFS_energy @CUP_Plasma @MIT The new heat pump in Model Y is what really makes the difference in cold weather
1,@thatt3slaguy @Model3Owners @FutureJurvetson @CFS_energy @CUP_Plasma @MIT Yes; coming soon
1,@ErcXspace @SpaceX @FelixSchlang @MarcusHouseGame @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight Great render! The circumferential welds &amp; skin panels will be much smoother in future builds.
1,@Model3Owners @FutureJurvetson @CFS_energy @CUP_Plasma @MIT That’s very hard to do. Have you tried pushing on the charge port door to open? It’s designed to support a manual press to open as well as automatic.
1,@FutureJurvetson @CFS_energy @CUP_Plasma @MIT It’s cool &amp; for sure can &amp; should be done; but I suspect its best case will be more costly than wind &amp; solar (aka big fusion reactor in sky)
1,@austinbarnard45 Weld esthetics will improve greatly in upcoming Starships
1,@PPathole Haha true. Why do showers have such a wide range!?
1,@UniverCurious @physicsJ Light is not as fast as you’d think
1,@SamTalksTesla Maybe we used too many magenta spotlights
1,@ValaAfshar @Tesla Having a low center of gravity makes a world of difference to safety
1,@vm_one1 @waEMD @SpaceX We will probably IPO Starlink; but only several years in the future when revenue growth is smooth &amp; predictable. Public market does *not* like erratic cash flow haha. I’m a huge fan of small retail investors. Will make sure they get top priority. You can hold me to it.
1,@PerezShivam @waEMD @SpaceX Fate loooves irony haha
1,@waEMD @SpaceX Glad SpaceX could help! We are prioritizing emergency responders &amp; locations with no Internet connectivity at all.
1,@austinbarnard45 True
1,@teslavibes That’s total market; not all Tesla. We do see Tesla reaching 20M vehicles/year probably before 2030; but that requires consistently excellent execution.
1,@CathieDWood @skorusARK Seven years for sure to 30M+ new fully electric vehicles per year; six years maybe. Five years is possible; but unlikely. An extra year makes a giant difference when it comes to exponentials.
1,@flcnhvy @CathieDWood Both will do original cars
1,@CathieDWood We aren’t cutting the price of Model 3 to $25k. I was referring to a future car that will be smaller than Model 3.
1,@brian_heide @Tesla What about a heavy duty; paintball machine gun mounted on the bed rails?
1,@Pickenheim @matthew_kerle New version coming soon
1,@WholeMarsBlog Suppliers. We’re only doing high energy nickel ourselves; at least for now. Also; maybe the presentation wasn’t clear that we’ve actually had our cells in packs driving cars for several months. Prototypes are trivial; volume production is hard.
1,@TeslaGong @DrSallyL @sydney_ev @_TeslaTom @TeslaStraya @outbacktesla @ev_outback @Michael01996367 @cvanderstock @teslaownersau @AhillfromOZ @rjo71342 @EVHQ2 @michadru29 @DunkenKBliths If it passes Australian regulations; then sure
1,@flcnhvy @Kristennetten Checking into it
1,@Kristennetten Totally up to you; but if you head to a Tesla delivery center near you &amp; maybe help out new owners; that would be cool
1,@ID_AA_Carmack Completely agree
1,@Erdayastronaut Yes; the flaps are now directly driven by electric motors with a gearbox! No more hydraulics.
1,Thanks Tesla Team for great work on deliveries! For new owners; we super appreciate accommodating us on delivery timing! Definitely one of our toughest quarters in global logistics.
1,@ScottAdamsSays There are times when I feel like I’m living in a Dilbert cartoon
1,@ArtifactsHub That species has stood the test of time
1,@flcnhvy @NASASpaceflight @austinbarnard45 @PPathole Mostly 304L; some 301. Broke at 301 to 304 interface. SN9 will be all 304. Also; we’re making some tweaks to the 304 alloy mixture.
1,@NASASpaceflight @austinbarnard45 @PPathole 8 bar differential in ullage; 9 bar at base due to propellant head. It’s enough. Improvements in work.
1,@PPathole We just need enough height to test body flaps &amp; drawing propellant from headers vs main tanks. Will do several flights to confirm working well; then add heat shield &amp; go high Mach.
1,First flight is to 15km or ~50;000 ft
1,Nosecone &amp; front flaps next week. SN9 next month.
1,Starship SN8 with rear body flaps https://t.co/GdxMbzX0ct

1,@EvaFoxU True
1,@hisdirtremoves @SpaceX Not bad
1,@enn_nafnlaus @ajtourville Exactly

1,@EvaFoxU Something like this https://t.co/NDVuUmms67
1,@ajtourville Can’t support 3 wheel vehicles. Not safe enough.
1,@MarlonSIX60 Something appealing about Hawking/Hartle idea; but I agree with Turok/Feldbrugge/Lehners
1,@PPathole @MarlonSIX60 True
1,@PPathole @Erdayastronaut There are some practical size constraints too. Can’t be too big to fit in the engine compartment. But; it could be a little bigger. 380 sec Isp would be nice.
1,@PPathole @Erdayastronaut Doesn’t seem to be a problem. We could probably increase area ratio; given 330 bar max demonstrated chamber pressure.
1,@DJSnM Preburners ignite; then main chamber
1,@MarlonSIX60 Where is our prediction of probability inaccurate?
1,@MarlonSIX60 Or energy &amp; time; but besides that what?
1,@podcastnotes Genetic engineering is too slow unless you use a synthetic virus
1,What can’t we predict?
1,@tobyliiiiiiiiii @Erdayastronaut Yeah; but might not need it
1,@Erdayastronaut 107 expansion ratio. You can a little bit of flow separation towards the end of the nozzle.
1,Only thing beyond ludicrous is plaid https://t.co/rHuWk20EGG

1,@FutureJurvetson @hiromichimizuno Thanks for your many years of support through very tough times!
1,@ICannot_Enough @WholeMarsBlog We will be a little below that this year (most challenging year we’ve ever had); but probably above that next few years
1,@WholeMarsBlog That’s about right. Maybe a little faster.
1,@tobyliiiiiiiiii @CARandDRIVER @Tesla Haha
1,The extreme difficulty of scaling production of new technology is not well understood. It’s 1000% to 10;000% harder than making a few prototypes. The machine that makes the machine is vastly harder than the machine itself.
1,@NASASpaceflight @BocaChicaGal Haha
1,We intend to increase; not reduce battery cell purchases from Panasonic; LG &amp; CATL (possibly other partners too). However; even with our cell suppliers going at maximum speed; we still foresee significant shortages in 2022 &amp; beyond unless we also take action ourselves.
1,Important note about Tesla Battery Day unveil tomorrow. This affects long-term production; especially Semi; Cybertruck &amp; Roadster; but what we announce will not reach serious high-volume production until 2022.
1,@EvaFoxU Thanks!
1,@Neopork85 @SpaceX @MarcusHouseGame We really need better legs for Starship. They’re coming.
1,@Neopork85 @SpaceX @MarcusHouseGame Most likely; all flaps will fold after landing to reduce wind tip over force. There may be some cases where flaps deployed help stability (change in wind direction); in which case one or more flaps will extend.
1,@Model3Owners Fine; we’ll do it already 😀
1,@ARKInvest @TashaARK Good analysis; although I think we should wait until FSD is a bit more mature
1,@singing__surfer I’m pretty sure Tesla could do a much better autocorrect. The bar is so low haha.
1,@LorenzoTeixeir4 @Zog_Fot_Pik @samiralyateem @ID_AA_Carmack True
1,@IgorAntarov @soumiksf @ID_AA_Carmack Custom ultra high speed bus &amp; efficient cooling
1,@flcnhvy @soumiksf @ID_AA_Carmack Pretty much any machine-learning
1,@jgrano305 @soumiksf @ID_AA_Carmack It’s big
1,@Zog_Fot_Pik @samiralyateem @ID_AA_Carmack Sure
1,@soumiksf @ID_AA_Carmack Yeah; we will open Dojo for training as a web service once we work out the bugs
1,@samiralyateem @ID_AA_Carmack There are a lot of pointless zeroes in FP32 neural nets. You can chop off 16 of the 32 bits without losing meaningful precision. This works well with neural nets; but not with regular computing; which expects extreme precision.
1,@soumiksf @ID_AA_Carmack Dojo uses our own chips &amp; a computer architecture optimized for neural net training; not a GPU cluster. Could be wrong; but I think it will be best in world.
1,@llamaa35079089 @ID_AA_Carmack @Tesla You really want waypoints this much?
1,@ID_AA_Carmack For Dojo; we’re betting on FP16 with floating floating point (essentially; truncating mostly zeroes); so it feels like FP32 &amp; existing software just works. We considered FP8 for a while; but everyone hated it. I even asked Twitter! For inference; int8 works great.
1,@WholeMarsBlog There’ll be lots of green space around factory; but building itself is continuous. The “open” areas inside are covered. They’re internal semi truck roads inside a giant monolithic building.

1,@teslaownersSV @Model3Owners @TrungTPhan Felt I had done enough on the Internet (Zip2 &amp; PayPal) that my work would be useful to others. Needed to get going on accelerating sustainable energy &amp; making life multiplanetary.
1,@Model3Owners @TrungTPhan It took an utterly insane amount of work to move the SpaceX &amp; Tesla success probabilities above ~zero
1,@TrungTPhan To be frank; in the early days; I thought there was &gt;90% chance that both SpaceX &amp; Tesla would be worth $0. The press &amp; aerospace / automotive industry at the time (correctly) agreed with me.
1,@fermatslibrary Irrational is such a funny word to describe numbers
1,of course I still love you
1,@DeborahPatteri @TENETFilm Sure; but which planet?
1,@TENETFilm Good movie
1,@Erdayastronaut Current was too strong for droneship to hold station. Thrusters to be upgraded for future missions.
1,@ChrisDungeon Lot has happened in 13 years
1,@Teslarati It will be very insane
1,Speedrunning Factorio in real life …
1,@cleantechnica No; but you make some great points. Important to note that iron’s cost advantage is partly offset by increased pack mass; so the fully considered cost is closer to nickel. That said; iron alleviates much of the scaling problem.

1,Have you hugged a tunnel today?
1,@ARKInvest @aurmanARK Good analysis
1,@PPathole Exactly
1,@flcnhvy Gary the snail is still winning; but we’re gaining on him/her
1,@ValaAfshar Tunnels are the solution to traffic. You can have as many levels as you want. Usable tunnel depth far exceeds tallest buildings; so would work even for New York or Beijing.
1,@MatthewCable6 @ErcXspace Just a guess; but probably mid teens. Booster &amp; stacking on orbital pad are likely limiting factors. We’ll build several ships just to improve the production system.
1,@ErcXspace Pretty accurate simulation; although SN8 will use 3 Raptors. If SN8 craters; SN9 &amp; SN10 are close behind. High production rate allows for fast iteration.
1,@teslavibes Couldn’t agree more — major software improvements are already in place to extend its life &amp; more coming
1,@cleantechnica Definitely not. Smartwatches &amp; phones are yesterday’s technology; Neuralinks are the future.

1,@WhatsupFranks @samiralyateem @WholeMarsBlog Exactly. Problems like that have been addressed.
1,@PPathole @WholeMarsBlog Yes. Good insight.
1,@samiralyateem @WholeMarsBlog All frames stitched to single frame (tricky; as all cameras overlap in different ways) &amp; then creating video segments for labeling &amp; training. Everything from the labeling tools themselves to training to inference had to be rewritten.
1,@WhatsupFranks @brandonbernicky @WholeMarsBlog Much
1,@brandonbernicky @WholeMarsBlog Releasing private beta in 2 to 4 weeks; public beta (early access owners who opt in) 4 to 6 weeks after that; then all US Tesla owners mid December. Above schedule is contingent upon not encountering major unexpected setbacks.
1,@WholeMarsBlog And this still isn’t using the dramatically better “4D” (aka simultaneous surround video from 8 cameras) architecture
1,@C_Bass3d @NASASpaceflight @MarcusHouseGame Cool

1,@wintonARK True
1,@DisruptResearch Tesla is best understood as a collection of about a dozen startups; mostly in series; increasingly in parallel. Every product line &amp; new production system was invented. Instead of playing chess with the same pieces as everyone else; create new pieces.
1,@DisruptResearch Tesla R&amp;D productivity is exceptionally good due to the caliber of engineering talent
1,Tesla Model S &amp; X have hospital-grade (HEPA) air filters. 3 &amp; Y are really good too. This has a big effect on health. https://t.co/48s5D3IfWs
1,@RBReich All Tesla workers also get stock; so their compensation increased proportionately. You are a modern day moron.
1,@Teslarati Rawlinson didn’t design Model S. Prototype was done before he joined &amp; he left us in the lurch just as things got tough; which was not cool. He did make some contributions to body/chassis engineering; but not to powertrain; battery; electronics or software.
1,@Erdayastronaut @PPathole @SpaceX We’re pretty close to the manufacturing size limit for a milled copper &amp; steel jacket nozzle. Lot of complexity to add a nozzle extension to a sea level engine for small gain. Also hard to fit bigger engine nozzles on the booster.

1,@PPathole @SpaceX This is a test engine. Flight articles are fixed with no gimbal.
1,@SpaceX Worth noting that thrust is only slightly higher with the big bell nozzle version. Larger bell is primarily for efficiency in vacuum. Aiming for 380+ sec Isp for RVac long-term. Initially likely to be ~372.

1,@kulpability @tlowdon @EthicalSkeptic One person at Tesla (out of 60;000) was hospitalized in serious condition (he caught cov2 at home; not work); no deaths. I called his wife &amp; Hayward hospital to make sure he was getting the right treatment; but which he was.
1,@tlowdon @EthicalSkeptic Some of the tests we initially tried at Tesla were ~50% false positive; including some from major medical device companies. Too many testing methods were approved too quickly. Wouldn’t blame the FDA; though. Public was demanding fast test approval.
1,@WholeMarsBlog @MarcusHouseGame @Neopork85 @SpaceX @Erdayastronaut @SpaceToday1 @ElonsWorld @FelixSchlang @ChrisG_NSF @DJSnM Not yet
1,@MarcusHouseGame @Neopork85 @SpaceX @Erdayastronaut @SpaceToday1 @ElonsWorld @FelixSchlang @ChrisG_NSF @DJSnM Yes. This is the hardest part of the booster design.
1,@ICannot_Enough People read too much into this level of detail. It’s not useful for predicting the future; nor can we ourselves accurately predict what issues we will encounter on a short-term; fine-grained level.
1,@ICannot_Enough Critical feedback is always appreciated btw
1,@biogirl09 @JaneidyEve @Tesmanian_com @SpaceX We can’t have a blanket pass; but maybe for some events
1,@flcnhvy @PPathole @ID_AA_Carmack Later versions of a larger device would have that potential
1,@PPathole @ID_AA_Carmack Actually C; although the syntax could be improved esthetically
1,@ID_AA_Carmack I like C; because it avoids class warfare

1,@flcnhvy @DJSnM Neuralink this month &amp; Tesla next month; SpaceX probably October. We will have made a lot of progress by then. Might have a prototype booster hop done by then.
1,@zeitmas @DJSnM Soon
1,@DJSnM They’re quite accurate!
1,@EvaFoxU That number sure comes up a lot 🤣🤣
1,@ajtourville @peterdog15 I’m fine with reasonable drone footage. Just needs to be at a fair distance &amp; not coming right up to people. I think our security was a little overzealous in this case.
1,@GerberKawasaki @Tesla Thanks to a smart and hardworking team at Tesla. These sure are wild times …
1,@Teslarati Much appreciated. This was a serious attack.

1,@cleantechnica But actually nothing. Was surprised to hear they’re across the road. Adding silicon to carbon anode makes sense. We already do. Question is just what ratio of silicon to carbon &amp; what shape? Silicon expands like crazy during discharge &amp; comes apart; so cycle life is usually bad.

1,@engineers_feed Astronaughty
1,@PPathole @Erdayastronaut @dauqhx @universal_sci Mars is easier than the moon for propellant production. Could get going with only one ship; where the ship itself is the propellant plant. Needs to make ~2 tons/day.
1,@Erdayastronaut @dauqhx @universal_sci Starship propellant is ~78% oxygen; so an O2 plant on the moon would be enough. Otherwise; we could brute-force it with tankers to low Earth orbit. That’s probably faster.
1,@waitbutwhy Now I want candy
1,@dauqhx @universal_sci There’s a lot of frozen CO2 &amp; H2O on Mars. Heating the planet will densify the atmosphere. It’s solvable.
1,@universal_sci Perhaps one day there will be an ocean on the northern part of Mars
1,@jchybow @jwangARK @wintonARK It’s almost working reliably
1,@jwangARK @wintonARK Very different computers are needed for training vs inference. FSD is mostly Int8; but Dojo is de facto FP32 (feels like FP32; but actually FP16 with boring bits truncated) so we don’t need to rewrite all the training software. It should work almost immediately.
1,@jwangARK @wintonARK Not exactly GPUs for NN. Lots of cores optimized for dot products with fast local memory &amp; super high bandwidth between cores &amp; efficient liquid cooling. Compiler needs to be optimized too.
1,@tesla_addicted @Erdayastronaut No &amp; not possible at this scale
1,@Erdayastronaut Orbital launch mount
1,@NASASpaceflight Yeah. Occasional flights from land are ok; but frequent (daily) flights probably need ~30km / 18 miles clear area for noise.
1,@schristakos @skorusARK Sure
1,@shortword On it
1,@coach23life I tried to warn them; but they just dug their own grave twice as fast!
1,@skorusARK 400 Wh/kg *with* high cycle life; produced in volume (not just a lab) is not far. Probably 3 to 4 years.
1,@NASASpaceflight Starship/Super Heavy; which is ~10X mass of Zenit; will mostly launch from ocean spaceports long-term

1,@DanielleFong @ajtourville @comma_ai @Tesmanian_com Absolutely needs liquid cooling. We’re applying our experience cooling half megawatt drive unit power electronics in cars to computers.
1,@TeslaTested That’s an error in Canada. The lease payment is specifically lower than loan financing; as Tesla expects to repossess the car. This is essentially a bet on residual value. If you believe residual value will rise; buy on loan; if you think it will drop; then lease.
1,@tobyliiiiiiiiii @Erdayastronaut @nextspaceflight We will push for ten flights with Starlink
1,@flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @nextspaceflight Almost never need to replace whole engine; but some individual parts like turbine wheels need to be replaced over time. Similar to a jet engine.
1,@Erdayastronaut @cnunezimages @SpaceIntellige3 Mostly for employees; but we’ll support public access whenever it’s safe &amp; secure. Public support is critical to making life multiplanetary.
1,@EvaFoxU @cnunezimages @SpaceIntellige3 Absolutely 😃 🏝
1,@Erdayastronaut @nextspaceflight I don’t want be cavalier; but there isn’t an obvious limit. 100+ flights are possible. Some parts will need to be replaced or upgraded. Cleaning all 9 Merlin turbines is difficult. Raptor is way easier in this regard; despite being a far more complex engine.
1,@cnunezimages @SpaceIntellige3 I’ve been working in Boca since Sunday. August heat &amp; humidity in South Texas is intense! If you think of it like a tropical resort; that makes it better though.
1,@ajtourville @comma_ai @Tesmanian_com Dojo V1.0 isn’t done yet. About a year away. Not just about the chips. Power &amp; cooling problem is hard.
1,@Erdayastronaut @C_Bass3d @NASASpaceflight @FelixSchlang It’s counter-intuitive; but Raptor has so much thrust at high Isp with liquid (high density) propellant &amp; pump-fed (light tanks); that it beats hot gas for the flip. That said; hot gas beats the heck out of N2 for orbital manuevers &amp; stabilizing ship if landing in high winds!
1,@nextspaceflight Payload reduction due to reusability of booster &amp; fairing is &lt;40% for F9 &amp; recovery &amp; refurb is &lt;10%; so you’re roughly even with 2 flights; definitely ahead with 3
1,@zubinanary @SpaceIntellige3 @guidodecaso @cnunezimages Yes; it will have huge nuts haha
1,@Teslarati We really need a bigger one; so adults can squeeze in too. Guaranteed to make a party more fun. Works well with flamethrowers!
1,@SpaceIntellige3 @guidodecaso @cnunezimages My favorite is one in tension; other DoF in compression. New Roadster wheels will only have one nut.
1,Aloha; welcome back from space 💫 https://t.co/xWPN09Wtaw

1,@jwangARK Humans are swiftly becoming a small percentage of total compute
1,@Erdayastronaut @ProgrammerDude Max demonstrated Raptor thrust is ~225 tons &amp; min is ~90 tons; so they’re actually quite similar. Both Merlin &amp; Raptor could throttle way lower with added design complexity. Raptor preburner &amp; Merlin gas generator flameout are what limit lower bound.
1,@justpaulinelol @NASASpaceflight That’s engine SN. We’re building SN8 of the ship.
1,@NASASpaceflight SN40 is about to be tested &amp; has several upgrades over 330 bar engine. For reference; 330 bar on Raptor produces ~225 tons (half a million pounds) of force.
1,Raptor engine just reached 330 bar chamber pressure without exploding! https://t.co/kVKRWksvaB
1,@Erdayastronaut Yeah; Starship will be a tiny dot at 20km. Hard to see with naked eye. We’ll do lots of flights.
1,@C_Bass3d @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @FelixSchlang Very impressive render. Note; legs will be bigger &amp; there’ll be way more stuff in engine bay. Main engines actually do majority of work in turning ship vertical before landing.
1,@PPathole @universal_sci This might sting a little …
1,@PPathole The “early investor” part of Tesla is wrong. That bs has been pushed by Eberhard (worst person I’ve ever worked with and that’s saying something!) for years.
1,@universal_sci Also; there could be long period comets that intersect Earth right now. We just haven’t observed them during humanity’s (very short) recorded history. Comet S-L 9 punched a roughly Earth-sized hole in Jupiter. https://t.co/ne7DM0YAXX

1,@teslaownersSV @PPathole @ICannot_Enough @flcnhvy @Tesla A lot of work remains. Technically; we have it working in sim with FPGAs at ~0.01% capability. This will be a true supercomputer.
1,@PPathole @ICannot_Enough @flcnhvy @Tesla Dojo is still being built. Maybe a year or so from V1.0.
1,@ICannot_Enough @flcnhvy @Tesla Autopilot was trapped in a local maximum; labeling single camera images uncorrelated in time. Now; it is not.
1,@ICannot_Enough @flcnhvy @Tesla Your insights over the years have been excellent. That’s approximately right.

1,@Nikola_Truth Haha true
1,@flcnhvy @teslaownersSV Exactly
1,@Kristennetten @teslaownersSV @Erdayastronaut Also definitely coming haha. Will only be on relatively recent cars; as we didn’t have an outside speaker until about a year ago. Can change inside sound easily.
1,@vicentes @teslaownersSV @Erdayastronaut Sorry; this is embarrassingly late. Two factor authentication via sms or authenticator app is going through final validation right now.
1,@_bennettm_ @Erdayastronaut Yes! We’re labeling bumps &amp; potholes; so the car can slow down or steer around them when safe to do so.
1,@Erdayastronaut This is what I meant by “4D” https://t.co/xpX7j5SnPy
1,@Erdayastronaut The FSD improvement will come as a quantum leap; because it’s a fundamental architectural rewrite; not an incremental tweak. I drive the bleeding edge alpha build in my car personally. Almost at zero interventions between home &amp; work. Limited public release in 6 to 10 weeks.
1,Tesla is developing a NN training computer called Dojo to process truly vast amounts of video data. It’s a beast! Please consider joining our AI or computer/chip teams if this sounds interesting.
1,@Teslarati More software improvements coming
1,@cleantechnica Significant improvements coming to S/X air suspension soon via software update! Will simultaneously improve performance handling &amp; ride comfort &amp; enable user customization of height &amp; damping; geocoded for relevance.
1,@stoolpresidente H2O; CH4/CO2; N2; iron; nickel; chrome; aluminum (not necessarily in that order) will matter far more than gold or platinum for space travel
1,@waitbutwhy @lukeprog What are the odds … ?
1,@viktaur27 @Teslarati The rate of improvement from original GPT to GPT-3 is impressive. If this rate of improvement continues; GPT-5 or 6 could be indistinguishable from the smartest humans. Just my opinion; not an endorsement. I left OpenAI 2 to 3 years ago. Am a neutral outsider at this point.
1,@Teslarati Tesla team is working hard on increasing Powerwall production
1,@Erdayastronaut Impressive
1,@Erdayastronaut @KenKirtland17 @torybruno @ulalaunch @SpaceX @blueorigin @DJSnM @ThePrimalDino Yes; integrated with the tip of the nose
1,@Teslarati This is important
1,@Erdayastronaut Probably not faster than utility power can be restored. Powerwall/Powerpack/Megapack can certainly be helpful long-term. https://t.co/tEE4LDTdYG
1,@KenKirtland17 @torybruno @ulalaunch @SpaceX @blueorigin @Erdayastronaut @DJSnM @ThePrimalDino Starship fairing will actually have more height than shown here. Dome will be flatter &amp; more of tip is accessible. Usable volume ~1000 cubic meters.
1,@pantsbobsponge @andyjstanton @TimFernholz You are correct. This is a substantial underpayment compared to what ULA has received.
1,@TimFernholz So why is this madness acceptable for Boeing/Lockheed rockets?
1,@TimFernholz Nobody would suggest buying airplanes that only fly once &amp; then crash into the ocean. That would be absurd …
1,@Tesmanian_com I generally try my best not to be on patents
1,@TimFernholz Efficiently reusable rockets are all that matter for making life multiplanetary &amp; “space power”. Because their rockets are not reusable; it will become obvious over time that ULA is a complete waste of taxpayer money.
1,@WholeMarsBlog Will be amazing to see it in operation! Biggest casting machine ever made. Will make rear body in a single piece; including crash rails.
1,@renarddemoscou @BillGates Sorry to hear this. What can we do to help?
1,@Teslarati No surprise
1,@Teslarati Aiming to make it super fun!
1,@Teslarati A little toastier each flight
1,@flcnhvy Same hex tiles; slightly different mounting method. Need bigger sections of tiles to see how they hold up with cryo shrinkage; pressure expansion &amp; body bending.

1,@lexfridman Clearly
1,@ramacvr @Kristennetten @PPathole @BernieSanders Also true
1,@PPathole @BernieSanders Over time; since we give all employees shares; my ownership is diluted automatically. From the first financing round; where I owned ~60% of Tesla to today at ~20%; it has declined by a factor of 3.
1,@RationalEtienne @BernieSanders I wonder if he reads his Twitter feed
1,@BernieSanders And why aim your attacks at Tesla; when we’re doing more than any other company on Earth to advance green/sustainable energy? Have you read the news? https://t.co/34tzBk5TIv
1,@BernieSanders That bs was pushed by oil &amp; gas interests to distract people from the $5 *trillion* per year they receive in subsidies. Bernard Sanders is a docile puppet of big oil! https://t.co/WmzJnoTFzI
1,@WR4NYGov @BernieSanders Good analysis. He also includes a govt loan for high efficiency vehicles that Tesla paid back with interest several years; unlike other auto companies.
1,@johnkrausphotos @Erdayastronaut @queue_max @NASASpaceflight Yeah; full name of engine is Velociraptor or Raptor for short
1,@tobyliiiiiiiiii @Erdayastronaut @queue_max @NASASpaceflight Haha; good catch. Booster will have fixed legs that add ~2m in height.
1,@Erdayastronaut @queue_max @NASASpaceflight I think we can get (Veloci)Raptor T/W on par with Merlin. Latter also started out with about half its current T/W.
1,@NASASpaceflight It will look crazy tall with booster &amp; fairing at 122m / 394 ft
1,@TimothyBuffett @Teslarati Apart from failing to quarantine elderly/at-risk people early (a mistake they recognize); they were right
1,Good piece on Giga Berlin construction
1,@FutureJurvetson @SpaceX This seems increasingly likely
1,@Teslarati This is gonna be great
1,@PPathole @TrevorMahlmann @arstechnica We’ll do several short hops to smooth out launch process; then go high altitude with body flaps
1,@ebelardo73 @bluemoondance74 @TrevorMahlmann @arstechnica Soon
1,@TrevorMahlmann @arstechnica V1.1 legs will be ~60% longer. V2.0 legs will be much wider &amp; taller — like Falcon; but capable of landing on unimproved surfaces &amp; auto-leveling.
1,@flcnhvy Progress is accelerating
1,@SciGuySpace Exactly
1,@austinbarnard45 Mars is looking real
1,@TrevorMahlmann Possible flight in 3 mins
1,@Erdayastronaut Most likely
1,@flcnhvy @Lindw0rm @cleantechnica True
1,@Lindw0rm @cleantechnica Highly likely down the road
1,@cleantechnica True fact
1,@NASASpaceflight Scrubbed for the day. A Raptor turbopump spin start valve didn’t open; triggering an automatic abort. We’ll figure out why &amp; retry tomorrow.
1,@Erdayastronaut I’m in the Boca control room. Hop attempt in ~33 minutes.

1,@Erdayastronaut @Blamblas @latimes @SpaceX @blueorigin Exactly. Mars propellant production will combine atmospheric CO2 &amp; water (ice) to make CH4 (methane) &amp; O2.

1,@Kristennetten @EvaFoxU @Tesla Exactly!
1,@EvaFoxU @Tesla Giga Berlin / GF4 will absolutely be designed with sustainability and the environment in mind
1,@EvaFoxU @Tesla Sounds like we need to clear up a few things! Tesla won’t use this much net water on a daily basis. It’s possibly a rare peak usage case; but not an everyday event. Also; this is not a natural forest — it was planted for use as cardboard &amp; only a small part will be used for GF4.

1,@mstrwilliam00 @Erdayastronaut Aiming for 20 to 30 years; like aircraft
1,@Kristennetten @PicklePunchD @Erdayastronaut Yes. There will be a lot of jobs on Mars!
1,@PicklePunchD @Erdayastronaut Needs to be such that anyone can go if they want; with loans available for those who don’t have money
1,@EcoHeliGuy @Erdayastronaut Yeah. A lot of work is needed for propellant production on Mars.
1,@Erdayastronaut That’s the goal
1,@Erdayastronaut Building 100 Starships/year gets to 1000 in 10 years or 100 megatons/year or maybe around 100k people per Earth-Mars orbital sync
1,@Erdayastronaut Starship design goal is 3 flights/day avg rate; so ~1000 flights/year at &gt;100 tons/flight; so every 10 ships yield 1 megaton per year to orbit
1,Megatons per year to orbit are needed for life to become multiplanetary
1,@fighteer1 @LCS_Big_Mike @SciGuySpace That’s about right
1,@g33st111 Reaction to Cyberpunk 2077 slipping release date to September
1,@SPEXcast @SciGuySpace What’s amazing is how non-linear the effect of gravity is. Starship can travel by itself from surface of Mars to surface of Earth; but requires massive booster on Earth with orbital refilling to get to Mars; which is ~38% of Earth gravity.
1,@SPEXcast @SciGuySpace Densification isn’t needed to return the ship &amp; limited cargo from Mars; but it’s an option for increasing cargo return capability if needed
1,@SciGuySpace Fundamental issue with SLS is that it’s not reusable; which means that a billion dollar rocket is blown up every launch! 💯 tragedy.
1,@SciGuySpace Densifying hydrogen is difficult; as its liquid temp is close to absolute zero. Much easier with CH4; which is an underappreciated advantage. Cooling O2 is good too; but becomes operationally difficult at N2 liquid temp; as air is ~78% N2. Entire system wants to drip air!

1,@ErlendMoberget @ramez @KHayhoe Very true. What’s really mindblowing is how much energy the sun outputs &amp; how little of it is absorbed by Earth. There is sooo much solar energy. We can solar power all of human civilization with a tiny % of Earth’s surface; which is a super tiny % of energy emitted by the sun.
1,@Alejandro_DebH @macshlibber @SpaceflightNow Advancing humanity’s understanding of the Universe is a fundamental motivator for SpaceX! Starship can put giant 🔭 in orbit &amp; on moon. With an occluder; could image 🌏 in other star systems.
1,@Neuro_Skeptic One person’s MRI machine is another’s railgun! Made a primitive one when I was studying physics at Penn. Hard to wield though.
1,@Alejandro_DebH @macshlibber @SpaceflightNow Exactly. We’ve had good discussions with leading astronomers. One way or another; we’ll make sure Starlink doesn’t inhibit new discoveries or change the character of the night sky.

1,@ramez @KHayhoe Good analysis; although a bit conservative imo. However; using a high upper bound for land area that’s *still* a tiny % of the US prob helps convert some naysayers. That giant fusion reactor in the sky called the sun outputs a truly staggering amount of energy!

1,@RQuiddich Every tank under pressure is a balloon tank — it’s just question of degree. Starship tanks are not balloon tanks like Atlas in sense that they don’t collapse when depressurized on the ground.
1,@Erdayastronaut @BocaChicaGal @NASASpaceflight Everything is compressible; but liquid compression at these pressures is not significant. However; the tanks do expand under pressure; creating a bit more volume. Keeping propellant super cold has a big effect on density of ~10% in case of CH4.
1,@Erdayastronaut @BocaChicaGal @NASASpaceflight A given tank pressure is needed to feed the engine turbopumps &amp; pressure-stabilize/relieve compression load on the cylinder walls
1,@Erdayastronaut @BocaChicaGal @NASASpaceflight Dome to barrel weld made it to 7.1 bar; which is pretty good as ~6 bar is needed for orbital flight. With more precise parts &amp; better welding conditions; we should reach ~8.5 bar; which is the 1.4 factor of safety needed for crewed flight.

1,@flcnhvy @SpaceX @NASA Wow; hard to believe that was 10 years ago!
1,@cam5442 @FlatJannrickles @AlexBerenson @JeffBezos @jack @Twitter Jack is doing his best. I support him.
1,@AlexBerenson @JeffBezos Time to break up Amazon. Monopolies are wrong!
1,@AlexBerenson This is insane @JeffBezos
1,@PPathole That’s when all life on Earth will be boiled off. What matters is how long civilization is capable of making the jump to Mars. This could be a very short period of time measured in decades. It took 4.5 billion years to get to this point &amp; civilization isn’t looking super stable.
1,@SciGuySpace So many war stories over 18 eventful years! But Starship can make life multiplanetary; which is what really matters for safeguarding the light of consciousness &amp; life as we know it. 100X improvement over Falcon/Dragon.
1,Off Twitter for a while
1,@WholeMarsBlog This is a major problem!
1,@seinfeldguru @WholeMarsBlog Nope haha
1,@itsALLrisky 🤣🤣

1,Needs be able to get from Starbase to South Padre Island; which requires crossing the channel
1,@WholeMarsBlog Off-label use 🤣
1,Cybertruck will be waterproof enough to serve briefly as a boat; so it can cross rivers; lakes &amp; even seas that aren’t too choppy
1,@phibetakitten Submarines use electric motors under water …
1,Works on land too
1,As well as advanced chip &amp; supercomputer engineers for next-gen training &amp; inference
1,Note; this event is meant for recruiting AI &amp; robotics engineers; so will be highly technical
1,@stevenmarkryan Pretty much. AI/robotics engineers who understand what problems need to be solved will like what they see.
1,@WholeMarsBlog @Gfilche There will be lots of technical detail &amp; cool hardware demos

1,@MuskUniversity Fully reusable orbital rockets are the fundamental breakthrough needed for humanity to become a multiplanet species
1,@stocktalkweekly @WholeMarsBlog @SawyerMerritt The terminology is outdated &amp; inaccurate. This is a tiny over-the-air software update. To the best of our knowledge; there have been no injuries.

1,@teslaownersSV @Teslarati Maybe little electric Tesla boats with a retro-futuristic Victorian design
1,@Teslarati Long-term goal is a boardwalk with amenities that goes all the way to downtown Austin; so you can walk; bike or kayak
1,@Teslarati Area from south Giga to river really will be next-level great &amp; open to public!
1,@Teslarati @KlenderJoey Ecological paradise plans from south portion of Giga Texas to river look great; however we must first get the factory financially on its feet
1,@enn_nafnlaus @treygahigh @TaraBull808 @theliamnissan @RBReich I was instrumental in creating OpenAI; which made DALL-E
1,@enn_nafnlaus @treygahigh @TaraBull808 @theliamnissan @RBReich Although his methods of instruction very strongly favored stick over carrot; I did learn a tremendous amount of engineering from him &amp; appreciation of art (he is an extremely talented artist)
1,@enn_nafnlaus @TaraBull808 @treygahigh @theliamnissan @RBReich Boys High was a good school; but it was government; not private. Brooklyn would be considered a middle income; not exclusive; neighborhood in America.
1,@enn_nafnlaus @TaraBull808 @treygahigh @theliamnissan @RBReich For sure
1,@enn_nafnlaus @treygahigh @TaraBull808 @theliamnissan @RBReich Errol ran out of money in the 90’s. My brother &amp; I financially supported him &amp; his extended family in South Africa since then on condition that he not do bad things. Unfortunately; he did do bad things :(
1,@enn_nafnlaus @treygahigh @TaraBull808 @theliamnissan @RBReich This is true
1,@Teslarati @ResidentSponge With some improvements; it will achieve 300 Mps
1,@enn_nafnlaus @TaraBull808 @treygahigh @theliamnissan @RBReich Incorrect. There was tuition for students from outside the school district; which was a small part of the student body; incl black students; but not for students in district; which I was.  Also; I was there for 2.5 years; previously attending govt schools for 9 of 12 years.
1,@enn_nafnlaus @treygahigh @TaraBull808 @theliamnissan @RBReich I went to government schools; not private; except for part of one year in third grade
1,@NASASpaceflight @yasin_shafiei @thejackbeyer @BocaChicaGal @NicAnsuini Probably Q2 next year; with vehicles initially transferred by boat from Port of Brownsville to the Cape
1,@BnOrdhaug @yasin_shafiei @thejackbeyer @NASASpaceflight @BocaChicaGal @NicAnsuini That’s the plan. We’re taking a little  risk there; as engine isolation was done as retrofit; so not as good as on Booster 9.
1,@yasin_shafiei @thejackbeyer @NASASpaceflight @BocaChicaGal @NicAnsuini Late next month maybe; but November seems highly likely. We will have two boosters &amp; ships ready for orbital flight by then; with full stack production at roughly one every two months.
1,@thejackbeyer @NASASpaceflight @BocaChicaGal @NicAnsuini Our focus is on reliability upgrades for flight on Booster 7 and completing Booster 9; which has many design changes; especially for full engine RUD isolation.
1,@enn_nafnlaus @theliamnissan @RBReich Exactly
1,@teslaownersSV @chicago_glenn @Twitter Seems that way @Twitter @paraga

1,@MuskUniversity Profoundly important concept
1,Great for clearing dust!
1,@Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight Booster 7 now returns to high bay for robustness upgrades &amp; booster 8 moves to pad for testing.  Next big test is probably full stack wet dress rehearsal; then 33 engine firing in a few weeks.

1,@PPathole @NewsfromScience @ScienceVisuals True
1,@NewsfromScience @ScienceVisuals Starship will be an incredible enabler for science. Full reusability &amp; high production rate drive several orders of magnitude improvement in $/kg to orbit &amp; beyond.  Next gen Starlink constellation is primary user of this rocket; so science doesn’t need to cover fixed cost.

1,@cb_doge @Tesla @mayemusk Still doing same thing; but bigger
1,Looks good to roll out to all Tesla owners with 10.12.2 (~100k cars)!
1,@Tesla__Mania @WholeMarsBlog That is probably the right order of magnitude
1,@WholeMarsBlog Real-world validation &amp; billions of miles of real-world training are what will make FSD superhuman
1,@cb_doge @paraga Sigh
1,FSD Beta 10.69.2 rolling out now. Please note that top priority is safety; so expect it to be overly cautious; especially around pedestrians.

1,@CodingMark @Andy8671025 @WholeMarsBlog Assuming 25% efficient PV cells at 0.8 surface coverage
1,@CodingMark @Andy8671025 @WholeMarsBlog Exactly. Ecosystem is almost entirely dependent on the sun already.   Civilization’s energy needs are absurdly tiny compared to what the sun sends us for free (~1 GWh/day/km^2).
1,@CSI_Starbase Yup; there’s a reason we do static fires! Much better to break things on the ground than en route to orbit.
1,@Andy8671025 @WholeMarsBlog Solar panels; ground mount &amp; rooftop; paired with stationary batteries; will be civilization’s primary source of energy; as sure as day follows night.   Mark these words.
1,@Tesla I love the graffiti art at Giga Berlin!
1,@WholeMarsBlog So much empty land &amp; only a tiny percentage needed to power entire country!
1,@WholeMarsBlog It’s looking good so far
1,@EvaFoxU Indeed
1,@BLKMDL3 @Apple @SpaceX We’ve had some promising conversations with Apple about Starlink connectivity. iPhone team is obv super smart.  For sure; closing link from space to phone will work best if phone software &amp; hardware adapt to space-based signals vs Starlink purely emulating cell tower.
1,@austinhinson_ @Tesla Note; I am putting a lot of time personally into advancing Tesla service to make it awesome. Hopefully; this is starting to be felt by Tesla owners.
1,@austinhinson_ You’re right; we should credit Tesla owners $100 if we change appointments with less than 24 hours notice. Should be reciprocal. @Tesla
1,@teslaownersSV Lot of people still don’t realize Tesla makes uninterruptible power supplies for your whole home (Powerwall)

1,@ev_australia @Tesla @SawyerMerritt @EvaFoxU @miku919191 @tesla_adri @PPathole @TeslaHype @TeslaDiva99 @teslaownersau @techAU We have since improved it further
1,@WholeMarsBlog The primary solution to a sustainable energy future is solar/wind with batteries for when sun doesn’t shine or wind doesn’t blow; interconnected with conventional high voltage lines. No unknown technology is needed!  Hydro+geothermal+fission will also be non-trivial contributors.
1,@WholeMarsBlog Fusion would be expensive energy; given difficulty of obtaining and transporting source fuel; plus maintaining the reactor.   Far better to use the Sun – thermonuclear reactor with no need to refuel or service.

1,@WholeMarsBlog 10.69.2 has a relatively small number of code changes; but their practical effect will be significant
1,@SpaceX More Starlinks reach orbit
1,@andst7 It will probably help proportionate to the cost of raising children
1,@andst7 Important. South Korea is currently tracking to lose about half its population roughly every generation. Long lifespan hides the dire nature of the problem.
1,@cb_doge .@Chrisrock invited me to open for one of his shows. Thanks Chris! I will try not to flounder too much.
1,@sirxapex @SciGuySpace Yes; also very important
1,@SciGuySpace Accurate assessment. Raptor design started out using H2; but switched to CH4. Latter is best combo of high efficiency &amp; ease of operation imo.  Delta-v difference between H2 &amp; CH4 is small for most missions; because CH4 tank is much smaller &amp; no insulation is needed.

1,Spent the day walking entire Giga Berlin production line – team is doing excellent work!
1,@jonbbc @WholeMarsBlog @aelluswamy 10.69.1 is even better. We reduced latency &amp; jitter in hardware command loop; so time from object detection to brake actuation is 10% to 20% better.
1,Kickass Internet connection coming Royal Caribbean ships soon!
1,@MuskUniversity It’s true
1,@teslaownersSV @SpaceX Ancient times
1,@teslaownersSV It will grow by at least 5 to 10 meters over time
1,@WholeMarsBlog First few days; just 1k owners; but going to 10k if no major issues.   Note; 10.69.2; hopefully going out week after this; is the wide release beta.
1,@MuskUniversity Good to ask yourself this often
1,@CSI_Starbase Agreed; we recently made this change &amp; many others.  An intense effort is underway to achieve robust engine containment in case of RUD to protect booster; other engines &amp; launch ring.

1,@WholeMarsBlog @RealDanODowd 🦇 💩 crazy
1,@BBC_Future I would gladly obey their commands; but I can’t tell what they’re saying!
1,@RationalEtienne @arctechinc I do not doubt that. Criticism; public or private; is welcome after we go to wide beta.   Early beta has many known issues. The reason we release it to a limited number of cars is to discover unknown issues.
1,@RationalEtienne @arctechinc No. Let me make something clear: James contacted me directly to be included in *early* beta; which is only ~1000 cars; mostly employees.   Early beta explicitly has issues or it would be rolled out widely; so publicly criticizing something he had asked for is wrong.

1,Neuralink progress update show &amp; tell on October 31 st (Halloween)
1,2 main goals this year:   - Starship to orbit - FSD wide release  Many other things; of course; but those are the 2 giant kahunas. Will require insane work by many super talented people; but; if anyone can do it; they can.   It is an honor to work with such awesome human beings.
1,It is the fastest way to get between one downtown and another with known physics (and the Standard Model is proving quiet resilient)!
1,Would be cool to do a (much simplified) Hyperloop demo tunnel between maybe Austin &amp; San Antonio?
1,Now @boringcompany tunnels are in active use in Vegas. Try it if you’re in town. Will be expanding to connect all major destinations in Vegas plus airport.
1,Funny how there are often simultaneous reactions saying “it’s impossible” and “it was already done 3000 years ago”
1,@chazman @aelluswamy Glad it’s working out! Thanks for giving us this tough case to solve. That’s what field testing is all about.  This early version of 10.69 is being extra cautious; so waits for a moderately big gap in traffic to cross. Upcoming releases will do better in heavy traffic.
1,@chazman @aelluswamy Just wanted to emphasize again that our awesome Tesla software/AI team is who really deserves the credit. The talent level at Tesla is incredible.
1,Note; you can upgrade your existing car to FSD in 2 mins via the Tesla app
1,After wide release of FSD Beta 10.69.2; price of FSD will rise to $15k in North America on September 5th.   Current price will be honored for orders made before Sept 5th; but delivered later.
1,FSD Beta 10.69 started rolling out to Tesla owners last night. This build is a big step forward!  10.69.1 probably end of week with wider release.  1069.2 in a few weeks should be good enough to provide to all FSD Beta participants.
1,@BLKMDL3 @Tesla Tesla Autopilot/AI team did great work with 10.69! Some point releases needed for polish; so 10.69.2 should really shine.
1,@aelluswamy Worth hearing about Tesla Autopilot software/AI progress
1,@WholeMarsBlog As mentioned previously; this is a major release; so we need to be cautious. Goes out to ~1000 Beta participants later today.

1,@teslaownersSV @CChomp13 There are many major code changes; so this will be an extra cautious rollout.  Releasing on 8/20 to ~1000 Tesla owners; then 10.69.1 next week to accommodate feedback &amp; release to ~10k customers; then 10.69.2 week after &amp; release to rest of FSD Beta.
1,@CChomp13 Entropy
1,@Andst7 Those are the questions that Twitter is doing everything possible to avoid answering …
1,@SawyerMerritt @ICannot_Enough Modifying your car after delivery is legal in America; so yes 😀
1,@ICannot_Enough That said; we will add autoconfigure to side mirrors
1,@ICannot_Enough Side mirrors cause ~5% range reduction at highway speed
1,@ICannot_Enough Yes; but side mirrors won’t be needed in a self-driving future
1,@RationalEtienne @MuskUniversity For some reason; I just agree with that guy so much!

1,@wonderofscience Mercury; the forbidden candy
1,@Elon_Quotes_ Almost all of Earth’s energy comes from the sun already – we would be a dark iceball at near absolute zero if not for the sun. And essentially the entire ecosystem is solar-powered.  Civilization uses a tiny amount of energy by comparison. Not hard to generate from wind/solar.
1,@teslaownersSV Although; if it were any team; it would be Man U. They were my fav team as a kid.
1,Standup is my side-hustle
1,@teslaownersSV And I’m not buying Coca-Cola to put the cocaine back in; despite the extreme popularity of such a move
1,@teslaownersSV No; this is a long-running joke on Twitter. I’m not buying any sports teams.
1,@WholeMarsBlog @karpathy Got to build those YouTube subscriptions!
1,@EvaFoxU Note; we are trying to reduce delivery times as quickly as possible. Long wait times are not a good thing.
1,@realginnyrobins Yeah; that’s what I mean

1,@EvaFoxU @PPathole @Andst7 So it seems
1,@PPathole @Andst7 Good question; why aren’t they?
1,@cb_doge Somehow I have 54 followers
1,@Andst7 Good summary of the problem.   If Twitter simply provides their method of sampling 100 accounts and how they’re confirmed to be real; the deal should proceed on original terms.  However; if it turns out that their SEC filings are materially false; then it should not.

1,@cb_doge Floki pic tomorrow
1,@BillyM2k @WholeMarsBlog The media has strong negative bias &amp; are driven by clicks (they can’t help it).  Unfortunately; I generate lots of clicks.  But these things move in cycles.

1,@heydave7 @WSJ As a “public person”; standard to win a defamation lawsuit against a news org is almost impossible. They could say I’m Satan and the “source” is their psychic!  Nicole is not a public person; so could win. I hope she sues them. @michaelsiconolf has done so many fake hit pieces.

1,@lovemesomemusk @WholeMarsBlog Nope
1,@teslaownersSV @heydave7 @WholeMarsBlog @WSJ Call them out on it; I guess. WSJ is supposed to have a high standard for journalism and; right now; they are way sub tabloid.  WSJ should be running stories that actually matter to their readers and have solid factual basis; not third-party random hearsay.
1,@heydave7 @WholeMarsBlog @WSJ WSJ has run so many bs hit pieces on me and Tesla I’ve lost count! It’s embarrassing for them; frankly.  They once wrote an article saying FBI was about to arrest me; so I called FBI to ask what’s up and they said WSJ article was total bs.  Just more shortseller fud.
1,@WholeMarsBlog Haven’t even had sex in ages (sigh)
1,@TeslaHype @WholeMarsBlog Yeah; the character assassination attacks have reached a new level this year; but the articles are all nothing-burgers.   I work crazy hours; so there just isn’t much time for shenanigans.  None of the key people involved in these alleged wrongdoings were even interviewed!
1,@WholeMarsBlog This is total bs. Sergey and I are friends and were at a party together last night!  I’ve only seen Nicole twice in three years; both times with many other people around. Nothing romantic.

1,@BillyM2k Arguably; we know more than nothing. “Death &amp; taxes are a certainty” – BF.
1,@karpathy Also worth getting a particle counter
1,@OwenSparks_ @karpathy It’s on the future product list. Especially important in places like Austin; which has next-level amounts of pollen in the air.
1,@konstructivizm Things will get wild when Andromeda collides with our galaxy!
1,@energybants @Liv_Boeree They should keep running
1,@karpathy True. I have a CO2 monitor on my desk. It beeps whenever ppm&gt;1000.
1,@SpaceX @Space_Station About twice as much useful mass to orbit as rest of Earth combined
1,@tanayj Absolutely
1,@Erdayastronaut @LevEakins More accurate word is “propellant”; rather than “fuel”. Starship is ~78% liquid oxygen; ~22% fuel.  Propellant cost is of primary importance for a fully reusable rocket; so reusable rockets want high thrust; as thrust below T/W of 1 is irrelevant.
1,@Rainmaker1973 I use this example a lot
1,@TJ_Cooney @SpaceX Starlink bandwidth varies a lot; depending on user terminal density &amp; time of day. That’s why the long wait in some areas.  Throughput is roughly linear with total V1 satellites in operation. V2 satellites are at least 5 times better (conservative estimate) than V1.
1,@TJ_Cooney @SpaceX Starlink is a gamechanger for remote locations

1,@cleantechnica Progress
1,@teslaownersSV @Tesla We’re making progress with Steam integration. Demo probably next month.
1,@teslaownersSV @cb_doge It’s a flat trade
1,@cb_doge Actually true. Then I suggested to the team that it didn’t need to be quite so pointy; since that’s just based on a movie joke; but everyone likes it pointy; so we kept it that way.
1,@BillyM2k @CryptoWhale 😋 bagels
1,@hohocho If inflation calms down; we can lower prices for cars
1,Tesla is to protect life on Earth; SpaceX to extend life beyond.
1,@PPathole 20 to 30 years from first human landing if launch rate growth is exponential.  Assumes transferring ~100k each rendezvous and ~1M total people needed.

1,@teslaownersSV The scale is 🤯 &amp; anyone can visit!
1,@waitbutwhy I wonder if there is a species in the Magellanic Clouds wondering who lives in the big galaxy they orbit
1,@PPathole @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX @Caspar_Stanley @IzanRamos2002 Some small tubes &amp; wiring need to be nested in a bigger tube for thermal protection; kinda like conduit in a house.   Engines themselves &amp; booster base are extremely robust. High strength stainless steel is bulletproof to a handgun at ~2.5mm thickness. Booster dome is 4mm.
1,@DJSnM @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX @Caspar_Stanley @IzanRamos2002 Electric power for booster &amp; ship is needed even when engines aren’t running &amp; incremental power draw of TVC isn’t too bad. We have local supercaps on each engine to deal with power spikes.
1,@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX @Caspar_Stanley @IzanRamos2002 Enabling engines to take the heat without shrouds might save over 10 tons; all things considered.  Shrouds are also a risk in that fuel leaks could be contained by the shroud; forming a MOX bomb.  Booster is purging all 33 engine shrouds in flight to prevent this.
1,@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX @Caspar_Stanley @IzanRamos2002 All mass necessitated by an engine design should count as engine mass; eg shrouds; TVC hydraulic power or excess purge gas.  Raptors in production now have electric TVC; saving over a ton of hydraulics mass on booster.
1,Dragon launching in 2 mins
1,@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX @Caspar_Stanley @IzanRamos2002 Most importantly; we need to delete or thermally protect remaining secondary structure; so we can remove shrouds
1,@arctechinc 10.13 goes to internal beta tomorrow; external next week. Should handle Chuck’s complex left turn.  Beta v11 hopefully end of next month; which just amounts to incorporating highway. Importance of “v11” has been reduced by all the 10.x releases. We’re already mostly at v11.
1,@karpathy Thanks for everything you have done for Tesla! It has been an honor working with you.

1,@BillyM2k @levie YouTube keeps playing me the same annoying scam ads every time I use it. The algorithm is convinced that I can “make money through Audible” …
1,@PPathole @planet4589 @NASASpaceflight That is one of the things we will be doing going forward.  This particular issue; however; was specific to the engine spin start test (Raptor has a complex start sequence).   Going forward; we won’t do a spin start test with all 33 engines at once.
1,@adamirvinmusic @BreitbartNews Trump would be 82 at end of term; which is too old to be chief executive of anything; let alone the United States of America.  If DeSantis runs against Biden in 2024; then DeSantis will easily win – he doesn’t even need to campaign.
1,@JoeTalkShow @BreitbartNews Yeah; but too much drama. Do we really want a bull in a china shop situation every single day!?  Also; I think the legal maximum age for start of Presidential term should be 69.
1,@BreitbartNews I don’t hate the man; but it’s time for Trump to hang up his hat &amp; sail into the sunset.  Dems should also call off the attack – don’t make it so that Trump’s only way to survive is to regain the Presidency.
1,Tesla’s automatic cabin overheat protection should make a real difference with record heatwaves.  Ability to adjust activation temperature coming with next software release.
1,@BonginoReport Not true
1,@planet4589 @NASASpaceflight Cryogenic fuel is an added challenge; as it evaporates to create fuel-air explosion risk in a partially oxygen atmosphere like Earth.  That said; we have a lot of sensors to detect this. More later.

1,Super fired up for future product development with our awesome Tesla team! Such an honor to work with them.
1,@WholeMarsBlog Also; being ruggedized for relentless salt spray &amp; extreme winds &amp; storms in deep ocean is not easy
1,@WholeMarsBlog No; it’s dual; high performance terminals; which are important for maintaining the connection in choppy seas &amp; heavy storms.  Still obv premium pricing; but way cheaper &amp; faster than alternatives.  SpaceX was paying $150k/month for a much worse connection to our ships!
1,@JoshSeefried A flying; electric boat would be sickkk
1,Starlink for boats!
1,@cb_doge Not bad!   It is high time that the future looked like the future.  Same goes for fashion.
1,@EvaFoxU @BillyM2k @tesla_adri Pretty much. A van would have more roof height; so you could stand or sit under it for shade.
1,@BillyM2k Maybe with an optional solar power canopy that extends both sides of the van; tripling roof area
1,@micsolana @rmcentush Exactly
1,Maybe Tesla should make a highly configurable Robovan for people &amp; cargo?
1,@PPathole Far too many people are under the illusion that Earth is overpopulated; even though birth rate trends are so obviously headed to population collapse

1,@WallStreetMav It is absolutely a present-day crime n progress! Shame on the creeps at “The New Yorker”.
1,Better to think of government; which is a monopolistic corporation in the limit; in terms of its feedback loop for improvement (or lack thereof)
1,Exactly; article misses the point.   Fire breaks; brush clears and plenty of water won’t stop all houses from burning down; but the situation would be vastly  improved if those things were done.
1,Yes. Please be careful in some areas; as there is non-zero risk of armed looters.   Cybertruck side panels are bulletproof to subsonic projectiles (handguns; shotgun &amp; Tommy gun); but the glass is not; so make sure to duck if you see anyone wielding a gun.  This is not fiction.

1,@jasondebolt The biggest factor; in my opinion; is that crazy environmental regulations prevent building fire breaks and clearing brush near houses.   That’s what allows massive fires to get going. Once they’re going; you’re just in damage control mode.   In this case; damage control also

1,Why has the British government refused to deport a convicted child rape gang leader to their home country?
1,Read the court transcripts. I did.   What was done to thousands of defenseless little girls in Britain was vile beyond belief.  When the fathers of the little girls tried to save them; the authorities arrested their fathers.

1,This is how great civilizations throughout history have ended.  People assume it was due to conquest; but it was actually often simply too much prosperity leading to low birth rate and population collapse; which ultimately enabled them to be conquered.

1,@Rothmus This is a gem 🤣🤣
1,@LinkofHyrule89 @YunTaTsai1 No AI was used for Starship. Just our little meat computers.
1,@YunTaTsai1 We’re quite a bit further from being fully Type I than it may seem.   Digital superintelligence will come many years before we reach even 10% of Type I.
1,Correct
1,That one gets me every time 🤣🤣
1,They just gave a guy 7.5 years in prison for social media posts.   That legal system is deeply broken.

1,@Rothmus @nypost @AdrianDittmann Exactly
1,Starmer is evil
1,@tunguz This is fucked up
1,Over 7 years prison for social media posts …  Whoever gave that sentence deserves prison themselves.   Thank God that America has freedom of speech in the Constitution!
1,@RadioGenoa Starmer lies
1,@SydSteyerhart @Sargon_of_Akkad Makes sense
1,True; but why?
1,Absolutely
1,@libsoftiktok Because every one of them is a future Dem voter. Simple incentives.
1,@BasedMikeLee Interesting
1,The “Guardian” is the worst form of groveling propaganda on the planet
1,Good question
1,@EdwardJDavey What exactly do I fail to understand about your failure to stop the mass rape of little girls in Britain; you sniveling cretin?
1,@WesternLensman It would matter if anyone believed or watched CNN
1,Understated; if anything

1,Oh like that time Starmer called @realDonaldTrump a racist and said the British government should do everything to stop him?  Or when Starmer sent British Labour Party members to campaign in the US against President Trump this year?  https://t.co/5R28WgZIj0
1,@matteosalvinimi @SpaceX This will be great. Other countries in Europe will ask to borrow it.
1,@DonaldJTrumpJr @grabagun @ClbrSpac The right to bear arms is what ensures America remains a democracy.   America remaining a democracy is what supports democracy in other countries.   Most people have no idea how fundamentally important 2A is to the world.

1,@Inevitablewest @PolitlcsUK Exactly
1,Unconscionable
1,@BoredJamesBored @visegrad24 Exactly
1,What an insane thing to say!   The real reason is that it would show how Starmer repeatedly ignored the pleas of vast numbers of little girls and their parents; in order to secure political support.   Starmer is utterly despicable.
1,@Rob_2628 Congrats!   Gets a bit repetitive in the high 90’s. Many hours of rifts.
1,@jonatanpallesen Utterly unacceptable
1,Starmer was deeply complicit in the mass rapes in exchange for votes.   That’s what the inquiry would show.
1,@wudijo RIP. It is sad to lose hardcore characters.
1,That’s how legacy media defines “far-right”
1,True

1,Man; I never realized this meme was real 😔
1,@catturd2 Thank God for America
1,OpenAI was funded as an open source; nonprofit; but has become a closed source; profit-maximizer

1,@GadSaad @PierrePoilievre It is at least within the realm of possibility
1,@GadSaad Why the resignation now?
1,Prison for Starmer
1,Gordon Brown committed an unforgivable crime against the British people
1,Starmer is complicit in the crimes
1,True

1,Starmer must go. He is national embarrassment.
1,For the truth; however beautiful or awful the truth may be; 𝕏 is where you will find it
1,I have not met Rupert Lowe; but his statements online that I have read so far make a lot of sense
1,Imagine you are a father going to rescue your daughter from gang rape and possibly murder; but the police arrest YOU instead …
1,For anyone doubting the severity and depravity of the mass gang rapes of little girls in Britain; go to the source material and read the court transcripts. I did.   It is worse than you could possibly imagine. https://t.co/OeK2uVxJ93
1,@bennyjohnson They lost because the people are sick of their failed policies
1,Good for Kemi Badenoch!
1,@senatorbabet They’re just trying to deflect from the horrifying truth and their guilt
1,Once again:  FREE TOMMY ROBINSON NOW
1,Troubling
1,Seriously 🤣🤣
1,Connect the dots …
1,The more you investigate; the worse it gets. Beyond what you think is possible.
1,So teachers don’t need to know how to read in New Jersey?  Seems like that would make it challenging to teach kids how to read.
1,@thatsKAIZEN Countries just become inauthentic theme parks of what they used to be
1,True
1,Jimmy Saville; longtime BBC employee; raped over 400 children while being paid millions by the BBC
1,They are devaluing the Presidential Medal of Freedom even faster than the dollar!  Didn’t think that was possible.
1,The Labour Party opposes a national inquiry on the mass rape of little girls in Britain for one reason only:   It will show that they were complicit.
1,The Reform Party needs a new leader. Farage doesn’t have what it takes.
1,@DefiantLs That contemptible worm posing as a judge should be thrown out and face criminal charges
1,Are these numbers accurate; @CommunityNotes?
1,You don’t hate the media enough. Especially; state propaganda arms like the BBC.   This is the same BBC that sheltered and paid Jimmy Saville; one of most horrific pedophiles in British history; for decades. https://t.co/cpW9LbtY71

1,There is no excuse. Please post the list of people who opposed this law and want to keep illegals who are convicted sex offenders in America.   They all need to be voted out of office. Every one of them.

1,@MarioNawfal What a wicked witch she is
1,@RupertLowe10 Absolutely
1,@MarioNawfal Rape of British girls on a genocidal scale

1,@RealDonKeith @narindertweets The legacy media covered up the mass rapes
1,@nicksortor Doesn’t make sense
1,Starmer was complicit in the RAPE OF BRITAIN when he was head of Crown Prosecution for 6 years.  Starmer must go and he must face charges for his complicity in the worst mass crime in the history of Britain.

1,Exactly. Time for Reform.
1,English version of the article (Die Welt translated it into German)
1,True!
1,Needs to happen and will happen in America

1,@michaelmalice True
1,@visegrad24 Terrible
1,@cb_doge Same 😂
1,In the UK; serious crimes such as rape require the Crown Prosecution Service's approval for the police to charge suspects.  Who was the head of the CPS when rape gangs were allowed to exploit young girls without facing justice?  Keir Starmer; 2008 -2013
1,Maybe it is time to do so
1,@Rob_2628 What’s your average xp/hour? Progress gets crazy slow above level 90.
1,💯 Treason
1,A new election should be called in Britain
1,You don’t hate the legacy media enough
1,@SAshworthHayes Unforgivable
1,@primalpoly @BillAckman Utterly contemptible
1,@EndWokeness What a pathetic cuck! Throw him in prison too.
1,What’s going on; @YouTube?
1,@ChoooCole @cybertruck I’m pretty sure we could get it running again too
1,@BillAckman Many wrongs need to be righted
1,@SuellaBraverman @GBNEWS @GoodwinMJ Disgraceful indeed
1,@DrewPavlou Free speech doesn’t mean paid speech
1,@BillAckman One of the worst things I’ve ever read about
1,AP stands for Associated Propaganda https://t.co/kh8rTuwlPK
1,They oppose an inquiry; because it will show that those in power were complicit in the cover-up
1,Absolutely
1,Whoever ordered the arrest of fathers trying to protect their daughters from gang rape should be in prison for life
1,@GilesUdy @britishmuseum Fire the management
1,@GadSaad Suicidal empathy; but they will take us all with them!
1,@fchollet True
1,Important
1,Free Tommy Robinson! @TRobinsonNewEra
1,Worth watching
1,This horrific crime has been going on for a very long time
1,There must be accountability
1,@DefiantLs Sniveling cowards
1,@WholeMarsBlog True
1,@Esther9982 Are the police not taking any action?
1,The evil knuckleheads picked the wrong vehicle for a terrorist attack. Cybertruck actually contained the explosion and directed the blast upwards.   Not even the glass doors of the lobby were broken.
1,@sam_bidwell He will be booed wherever he goes. Sniveling scumbag.
1,@Serena_Partrick Outrageous
1,@CSmithson80 @heydave7 @BLKMDL3 @mims This chart is a big deal
1,@BLKMDL3 @mims Predicting macroeconomics is challenging; to say the least. My gut feel is maybe around spring or summer 2022; but not later than 2023.
1,@mims If history is any guide; not many will make it past the next recession
1,@T_Ball5 Probably not wrong
1,@GailAlfarATX @SawyerMerritt Wow; working on this problem has soaked up a lot of my time &amp; brain cycles over the past ~7 years! This and Starship engines are currently the two hardest problems.
1,@SawyerMerritt Ashok was the first person recruited from my tweet saying that Tesla is starting an Autopilot team!
1,@SirineAti @engineers_feed FAA approval is the schedule driver. Their latest update says end of February.
1,Lex asks great questions
1,@cleantechnica Most people still have no idea that sustainable energy generation is growing so fast
1,@engineers_feed The resolution of the universe is not smaller than Planck length https://t.co/hoyZR4d0pP
1,@karpathy All of reality can be simulated with ones &amp; zeroes
1,@lexfridman Yeah; the smarter someone is; the harder it is to simulate/predict their behavior
1,@BillyM2k Now that the Webb telescope has been launched; they will have to spend more on rendering haha
1,@BillyM2k It is simulations all the way down; until you get to one bit
1,@PPathole People are able to break any laws made by humans; but none made by physics
1,Physics formulas are the rendering rules
1,So much of AI is about compressing reality to a small vector space; like a video game in reverse
1,@stats_feed @engineers_feed Useful mass to orbit is what matters
1,@DimaZeniuk @klwtts @TeslaClubNorway @WholeMarsBlog @SawyerMerritt @1stMarsColonist @daelmor @Kristennetten @28delayslater @Inelonwetrust__ @billhuang688 @EvaFoxU @GailAlfarATX As goes Norway; so goes the world. That said; still a long way to go to replace the fleet of combustion vehicles on the road.
1,@NASA @NASAWebb Congratulations; this is major!
1,Interesting https://t.co/548FHpnnxU
1,@nichegamer It’s good
1,@PPathole @Tesla That was a crazy tough year. Tesla financing closed at 6pm Christmas Eve – last hour of the last day possible. Payroll would otherwise have bounced two days after Christmas.
1,@cyantist It was a shamefully low blow from WSJ
1,@WholeMarsBlog And many other things
1,@davidjkon @Tesmanian_com No; that’s some tool with senior editor privileges who keeps putting that there
1,@Tesmanian_com “History is written by the victors” except on Wikipedia; as your enemies are still alive &amp; have lots of time on their hands 🤣🤣
1,@Tesmanian_com My wiki is such a dumpster fire 🤣🤣. That’s how you know it isn’t curated.
1,@GerberKawasaki A lot will be added
1,Tesla holiday software update goes to wide release today!
1,@WholeMarsBlog Tesla is technically a car like an iPhone is technically a phone
1,10.8 looks good; rolling out today
1,@BLKMDL3 Good idea
1,@BillyM2k @jack @gladstein @rahilla @farokh @samkazemian @TheSmarmyBum @ethereum That’s why I’m pro Doge
1,The @SkepticsGuide book is 👍
1,Lots of Tesla cars to deliver before year end! Your support in taking delivery is much appreciated.   Thanks also to the Tesla team working hard during the holidays!
1,@scottwww @realrobcopeland Yeah; I didn’t have a house in the Bay Area for over a decade; despite spending half the week there
1,Whereas radar has trouble seeing small pedestrians; they’re obvious to Tesla vision
1,@nurodev Disney restricted us to US only
1,@JeffTutorials Yes; but if we find unexpected bugs; release might be delayed until 24th
1,Tesla holiday software release being tested with internal owners today. Broader rollout starts tomorrow evening.
1,@WholeMarsBlog We’re aiming for a significant improvement for owners outside the US around March; depending on regulatory approvals
1,@Gfilche It’s a great whistle!
1,@WholeMarsBlog This assumes completion of the 10b sales
1,@cleantechnica Pure vision; especially when using explicit photon count; is much better than radar+vision; as the latter has too much ambiguity – when radar &amp; vision disagree; it is not clear which one to believe
1,@teslatidbits @WholeMarsBlog @DanCrenshawTX A strong bias towards consumption tax makes sense
1,@daelmor @BillyM2k @DanCrenshawTX 🤣 People who don’t create products &amp; services don’t realize that it takes hard work to produce products &amp; services
1,@DanCrenshawTX Agreed. Taxes do need to be collected; but what is the best way to do this that maximizes area under the curve of the happiness of the people?
1,@harald_murphy @SpaceX @Tesla @Jays200 A lot of improvement still coming just from software updates to satellites &amp; terminals
1,@Erdayastronaut I talked about Falcon 9 &amp; Heavy for over a decade!
1,@PPathole Still kinda hard to believe it is working
1,@PPathole @SpaceX Absolutely
1,100th SpaceX rocket landing was today

1,Has anyone seen web3? I can’t find it.
1,@BillyM2k With Starlink; you could stream video &amp; play online games
1,🤣🤣 True. Ask your airline for Starlink!
1,@JayinShanghai Sometime in 2022
1,@imoriginalankit Maybe I’m partly Chinese!
1,For those wondering; I will pay over $11 billion in taxes this year
1,@lexfridman Yeah
1,I’m not suggesting web3 is real – seems more marketing buzzword than reality right now – just wondering what the future will be like in 10; 20 or 30 years. 2051 sounds crazy futuristic!
1,@WorldAndScience Might very well be
1,Given the almost unimaginable nature of the present; what will the future be? https://t.co/b2Yw0AXGVA
1,@GailAlfarATX @peterdog15 @Tesla Tesla will hold a Giga Texas grand opening party with factory tours for the community in early 2022

1,@BLKMDL3 Probably
1,@johnkrausphotos @NASASpaceflight Haha; this is not even its final form! Although; pretty close.   Cape is hopefully this summer.
1,Tesla FSD 10.8 plus holiday fun software release probably Tuesday
1,@Space__Biscuit @NASASpaceflight 15 degrees
1,@NASASpaceflight Yup. Next booster will have 33 Raptor 2 engines; with 13 steering.   Ship is being upgraded to 9 engines (3 sea-level gimbaling; 6 vacuum fixed) with increased propellant load.
1,Each Raptor 1 engine above produces 185 metric tons of force. Raptor 2 just started production &amp; will do 230+ tons or over half a million pounds of force.

1,@PPathole @ScottAdamsSays @johniadarola @SenWarren Yeah!
1,@ScottAdamsSays @johniadarola @SenWarren I love Dilbert! Use it all the time to illustrate that we’re doing something wrong at Tesla/SpaceX if it could be a Dilbert cartoon irl. This happens more often than I’d like (sigh).

1,@GailAlfarATX @SawyerMerritt @dogecoin Imbued gold/bronze color would be sick
1,@jackfarrington @SawyerMerritt Manufacturers have to ship cars with side mirrors by law; but owners are allowed to modify their cars.  The wiper is what troubles me most. No easy solution. Deployable wiper that stows in front trunk would be ideal; but complex.

1,@joshdcaplan It’s true
1,@teslafsdbeta Replacing faulty/missing neurons with circuits is the right way to think about it. Many problems can be solved just bridging signals between existing neurons.  Progress will accelerate when we have devices in humans (hard to have nuanced conversations with monkeys) next year.

1,@Tesmanian_com The magnitude of the Starship program is not widely appreciated. It is designed to extend life to Mars (and the moon); which requires ~1000 times more payload to orbit than all current Earth rockets combined.
1,@Tesmanian_com If a severe global recession were to dry up capital availability / liquidity while SpaceX was losing billions on Starlink &amp; Starship; then bankruptcy; while still unlikely; is not impossible.  GM &amp; Chrysler went BK last recession.  “Only the paranoid survive.” – Grove
1,@micsolana The overarching problem is that we need better mental firewalls for the information constantly coming at us.   Critical &amp; first principles thinking should be a required course in middle school.  Who wrote the software running in your head? Are you sure you actually want it there?
1,@Rubix161 @thesheetztweetz @GerberKawasaki It’s getting fixed
1,@TeslaGong @GerberKawasaki Suits will need to be made in high volume at an affordable cost &amp; be much easier to use
1,@GerberKawasaki We had to shift some Starlink satellite orbits to reduce probability of collision. Not great; but not terrible either.  Station &amp; Dragon have micrometeorite shields (ultra high velocity impact absorption); but EVA suits do not; hence higher risk for spacewalk.
1,@engineers_feed 49 years later; games are photo-realistic 3D worlds. What does that trend continuing imply about our reality?

1,@mishaboar Good thread
1,@WholeMarsBlog Figuratively &amp; literally
1,@ajtourville We learned our lesson with $465M DoE loan received in 2010/2011 – onerous terms exceed value of money received. That’s why we paid it back so early; despite an early repayment penalty.
1,@timetravelart Maybe drive an upright Falcon 9 past the White House flying a giant Stars &amp; Stripes with a marching band playing “I can see clearly now”?
1,@PPathole @SpaceX That’s our initial interstage design that we scrapped
1,@existentialcoms Combined Tesla+SpaceX market cap is now over $1.2T; which means “$4.9B” is less than 0.4% of combined company value

1,@SawyerMerritt Such miracles are beyond us
1,@PPathole @Teslarati @13ericralph31 If we are able to make life self-sustaining on Mars; we will have passed one of the greatest filters. That then sets us up to become interstellar.  Earth is ~4.5B years old; but life is still not multiplanetary and it is extremely uncertain how much time is left to become so.
1,@Teslarati @13ericralph31 Earth has been and will be smashed super hard by meteors over time. Not a question of if; just when.
1,@Teslarati @13ericralph31 In 1992; comet Shoemaker-Levy smashed a hole in Jupiter the size of Earth https://t.co/nruaHoSIAQ
1,@Teslarati @13ericralph31 This will be really important one day.   Much is made of meteor impacts that destroyed most life on Earth; but there were far more that “merely” destroyed a continent.   Comets (not asteroids) are the real wild card; as we’re only able to track ~4600 out of  ~1 trillion.
1,About to launch asteroid defense test!
1,@Manic_Marge That is the great question
1,@westcoastbill Exactly
1,@WholeMarsBlog Exactly (sigh)
1,@cz_binance @CoinDesk @binance @egreechee Sounds good
1,@flcnhvy @WholeMarsBlog It can simulate anywhere; but we need to focus on one region until FSD is out of beta; then expand geographically to have betas in other countries. Canada is not a lot different from US; but different enough.
1,@WholeMarsBlog High-performance code is in C using our own compiler to maximize frame rate. We use Python with custom libraries for fast prototyping; then convert to C for fast execution.  New software is run against real-world video &amp; our world simulator to evaluate performance; then QA.
1,@cz_binance @CoinDesk @binance @egreechee I don’t use Binance (tried at one point; but signup was too many hoops to jump through); so no inconvenience to me personally. Just raising this issue on behalf of other Doge holders.
1,@WholeMarsBlog Our NNs didn’t have any temporal &amp; spatial memory or surround video auto-labeling back then – everything was knitted together in C++ from single frames with manual labeling.  Still much to improve.
1,@binance @CoinDesk @egreechee @cz_binance Doge holders using Binance should be protected from errors that are not their fault
1,@mishaboar Wisdom
1,@CoinDesk @binance @egreechee Hey @cz_binance; what’s going on with your Doge customers? Sounds shady.

1,@Teslarati @13ericralph31 Limiting factor for first launch is regulatory approval. Thereafter; fundamental issue is solving engine production.  Prototypes are easy; production is hard.
1,@John_Gardi True; although it will look clean with close out panels installed.   Raptor 2 has significant improvements in every way; but a complete design overhaul is necessary for the engine that can actually make life multiplanetary. It won’t be called Raptor.

1,@Paul49787221 @mooroobee @itsALLrisky @SenSanders Exactly
1,@PPathole @teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @itsALLrisky @SenSanders Yes; that is the other major source of dilution. All employees receive stock after a year at Tesla and we now have over 100;000 employees worldwide.
1,@MyAlteredEgo @kedarus @CollegeChef1 @JoeyTParker @SenSanders That loophole does seem questionable
1,@teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @itsALLrisky @SenSanders I had majority control for the first 5 years or so of Tesla; but car companies need lots of capital; so now I’m around 20% or so; despite putting in as much as I could along the way
1,@itsALLrisky @SenSanders Agreed; taxes are best applied to (especially extravagant) consumption; whereas capital allocation taxes reduce goods &amp; services output; so actually bad for the people.  Probable capital allocation skill of heirs is lower than original creator; so I am in favor of an estate tax.

1,@Erdayastronaut It is a very impressive history
1,@teslaownersSV @SamTwits Once the board was presented with the evidence of Eberhard’s deception/fraud &amp; the dire state of the company; all board members; including those he appointed; voted unanimously to fire him in August 2007.
1,@teslaownersSV @SamTwits He came damn close to killing Tesla through a combination of bad management decisions; driving out talented people; bad engineering; major blunders in supply chain &amp; an elaborate deception about the true cost &amp; schedule of the Tesla Roadster.
1,@SamTwits Founding story of Tesla as portrayed by Eberhard is patently false. I wish I had never met him.  Eberhard is by far the worst person I’ve ever worked with in my entire career. Given how many people I’ve worked with over the years; that’s really saying something …
1,@NASASpaceflight Good static fire with all six engines!

1,@TeslaHype @Teslarati @ResidentSponge Indeed; US taxpayers actually profited from the Tesla loan
1,@Teslarati @ResidentSponge GM &amp; Chrysler were bailed out (money never repaid); but Tesla was not.  Crucial Tesla investment actually came from Daimler in 2009; from which they did very well.  Tesla received govt energy efficiency loan in 2010; by which time capital markets reopened. Loan was repaid early.
1,@wapodavenport My plan is to use the money to get humanity to Mars and preserve the light of consciousness
1,@wapodavenport US Federal Debt/GDP was 56% in 2000; now it is 126% &amp; climbing fast
1,@wapodavenport US national debt is ~$28;900 billion or ~$229k per taxpayer.  Even taxing all “billionaires” at 100% would only make a small dent in that number; so obviously the rest must come from the general public. This is basic math.  Spending is the real problem.  https://t.co/1EwWyqdVsT
1,@tesla_raj You can also talk through the car speaker. Great for practical jokes :)
1,@jgrano305 @WholeMarsBlog Tentative plan is 98 &amp; above starts uploading Friday afternoon next week.  If we see any concerns; uploads will pause while we investigate; so might take a few days before everyone with 98 safety gets beta 10.4.  10.4 improves left turns across fast traffic &amp; stopping for gates.
1,@WholeMarsBlog FSD/AI team is doing great work. Will get superhuman good in upcoming releases.   Note; we will slow down upload rate of releases going forward. First from QA fleet to employee cars for a day; then slowly releasing at ~1000 cars/hr to external beta on Friday aft.
1,@JayinShanghai That math is incorrect; but still a lot of devices per second!   I guess if Tesla can reach 20M cars/year; that would be one every ~1.5 seconds!
1,@wapodavenport According to their own estimates; this tax only covers ~10% of the $3.5 trillion spending bill.   Where will the other 90% come from?   The answer is you.
1,@teslaownersSV Wow; 13 years ago
1,@TheBabylonBee I feel like this has happened at Tesla a few times
1,@MorningBrew I kinda like avocado toast &amp; pro level coffee tbh :) Starbase cuisine does an amazing job with those.
1,@QuantaMagazine Another way of saying we’re in a simulation

1,@Teslarati @KlenderJoey I’d like to express appreciation to Tesla Autopilot engineering &amp; QA for working round the clock all weekend to resolve the problem
1,@Teslarati @KlenderJoey Sorry to Tesla beta users for the trouble! Issue turned out to be power saving mode interacting with FSD.   Our internal QA fleet didn’t see this; because cars are constantly in use; so very rarely enter power saving mode. Internal QA will obv test this case going forward.
1,@GerberKawasaki Strange that moved valuation; as Tesla is very much a production ramp problem; not a demand problem
1,Wild $T1mes!
1,@coach23life @SawyerMerritt Indeed; this is intended to be useful advice; based on my extremely painful experience; not an attack in any way
1,@SawyerMerritt Prototypes are trivial compared to scaling production &amp; supply chain. If those are solved; achieving positive gross margin is the next nightmare.   Starting a second new vehicle line before first is working will divide resources &amp; amplify probability of failure.

1,Seeing some issues with 10.3; so rolling back to 10.2 temporarily.   Please note; this is to be expected with beta software. It is impossible to test all hardware configs in all conditions with internal QA; hence public beta.
1,@Filasophical @ShibaInuHodler Out of curiosity; I acquired some ascii hash strings called “Bitcoin; Ethereum &amp; Doge”. That’s it.   As I’ve said before; don’t bet the farm on crypto! True value is building products &amp; providing services to your fellow human beings; not money in any form.
1,@ShibaInuHodler None
1,@itsALLrisky @TeslaGong @mishaboar @DogecoinFdn Possibly. Bitcoin was conceived at a time of relatively low bandwidth &amp; high latency. If both continue to improve substantially; we will reach a point when no second layer is needed.

1,@johnkrausphotos @Erdayastronaut Hopefully
1,@Erdayastronaut Currently at ~270 bar; but working on upgrades to get it over 300 bar
1,@Erdayastronaut Raptor has a very high chamber pressure; which in turn allows for a large expansion ratio nozzle without flow separation at sea level
1,@TeslaNY @boringcompany @Tesla @maddiewhitetv This will be cool
1,@boringcompany Beat the 🐌!
1,@Teslarati @ResidentSponge We are
1,@BabyTesla3 @teslaownersSV @TheRealBuzz Very soon
1,@OwenSparks_ @teslaownersSV @TheRealBuzz Yeah; when we’re out of beta
1,@teslaownersSV @TheRealBuzz Most likely
1,@Liv_Boeree Absolutely
1,@TheRealBuzz Well-said; Dr Aldrin!
1,@PPathole @thesheetztweetz Well-optimized Starship would do ~250 tons to orbit as expendable &amp; ~150 tons fully reusable
1,@jhong @sama Nods
1,@wintonARK The day FSD goes to wide release will be one of the biggest asset value increases in history
1,@thesheetztweetz Full &amp; rapid reusability is the holy grail of orbital rocketry
1,@justindross Most big companies in tech have turned into places where talent goes to die
1,@MatchasmMatt @NHTSAgov Objectively; her track record is extremely biased against Tesla
1,@adamhoov They’re required by law; but designed to be easy to remove by owners
1,@long_elon @SciGuySpace @ShinodaChan_ Ovaltine is amazing!
1,@SciGuySpace @ShinodaChan_ I would gladly obey the chemtrails; but I don’t understand what they are saying haha!
1,@Neuro_Skeptic Luck is the best superpower
1,@pcgamer Good review
1,@SawyerMerritt As soon as major construction is done; so maybe in a few months
1,I’ve thought about and … I’m not sorry for party rocking
1,@slashdot Autonomy must &amp; will work even with no connectivity
1,@harrison_astro We can do that partially; but detailed rocket technology is considered advanced weaponry (same tech as nuclear missiles); so there are more limitations than at Tesla
1,@AnythingTesla @Tesla Yeah
1,@TrungTPhan Maybe Buffett should invest in Tesla haha
1,Thanks Cameron County; Brownsville &amp; South Padre for your support! Much appreciated.
1,@considercosmos @SpaceX Thanks!!
1,@MattWallace888 Hopefully enough to extend life to Mars
1,@vicentes @bradsferguson @MediaRedyns @RedMetalGiraffe We already have a giant; free fusion reactor in the sky called the sun. Just catch it’s energy with PV; store in battery &amp; you’re pretty much done.
1,@bradsferguson @MediaRedyns @RedMetalGiraffe Correct
1,@teslaownersSV Technical details will be in release notes
1,Beta 10.3 releasing Friday next week to all cars with 99/100 safety score
1,@AstroDebora @archillect Pretty much :)
1,@archillect Fan art is the best
1,@PPathole LASIK has improved so many people’s lives!
1,@nichegamer Great game
1,@Teslarati @ResidentSponge Haha
1,@blueorigin Congrats; was cool to send @WilliamShatner to space
1,@WR4NYGov @Tesla @LucidMotors @Rivian If it possible to start an EV company without shipping any cars &amp; get a valuation less than a billion dollars!?
1,@Gfilche @WR4NYGov @Tesla @LucidMotors @Rivian I hope they have a high pain tolerance. Scaling production; supply chain; logistics &amp; service is a world of hurt.
1,@harrison_astro Yes; we are talking to airlines about installing Starlink. Please let them know if you want it on your airliner.   Low latency ~half gigabit connectivity in the air!
1,@WR4NYGov @Tesla @LucidMotors @Rivian These are strange days
1,@JayinShanghai @brc06 @Tesla @TeslaCharging @teslacn They will
1,@PPathole Many great suggestions in this thread!
1,Can’t wait to be in Genshin Impact 🤣
1,@TeslaClubLA @PhilBrock4SM @SaMoMayor @SaMoManager Hoping to get this done soon
1,@timetravelart Aspirationally for everyone
1,@NASA @WilliamShatner Godspeed Captain
1,@UniverCurious @TechInsider “Lasers”
1,@JeffTutorials @Manic_Marge @Tesla Maybe next week. We’d like to get to 10.3 before expanding the beta.
1,@Manic_Marge @Tesla Always
1,@coffeetabletsla @alex_avoigt Agreed. Trying to get all the approvals needed to offer insurance is extremely difficult; but it’s coming.
1,@teslaownersSV Production; supply chain &amp; logistics are so hard!
1,@SciGuySpace Yeah
1,@cleantechnica But they should go electric now. Less range; but so easy; quiet &amp; clean.
1,@RGVaerialphotos Yeah; on its way (sigh)
1,Starship Launch Site https://t.co/1pNMpc57Q2
1,@NakamotoQuotes Beenz; Beenz the musical fruit the more you eat the more you toot
1,@Teslarati @Writer_01001101 All the stairwells currently shown as wood-clad will actually have graffiti
1,@NASASpaceflight Starship is a hard problem
1,@lexfridman Not to mention warm-up latency
1,@WholeMarsBlog Vision became so good that radar actually reduced SNR; so radar was turned off.   Humans drive with eyes &amp; biological neural nets; so makes sense that cameras &amp; silicon neural nets are only way to achieve generalized solution to self-driving.
1,@matty_mogul @Tesla @karpathy Just want to emphasize this is the work of hundreds of awesome engineers in both software &amp; hardware; over 1000 data analysts &amp; billions of owner miles
1,@CoffeexAnarchy Low occlusion gates are challenging; but should be fixed soon
1,Beta 10.2 now rolling out to cars with 100/100 safety score over 100 miles
1,@WholeMarsBlog It will be available in perforated rolls
1,@Papapishu [puff; puff] what if the cure for cancer  [puff; puff] was in the leaf 🍃??   🤯🤯
1,@WholeMarsBlog It’s coming
1,@BB_BORISBREJCHA @FelixHohagen Thanks for playing Giga Berlin!
1,@eggshellfriend I love ALW! Couldn’t agree more. My dog Marvin is Havanese too; although I’m *his* emotional support human.
1,@Sofiaan @Tesla Team is in fact working hard! They just confirmed 10.2 is good to go tomorrow night.
1,@cleantechnica It’s true
1,@SawyerMerritt @AustinTeslaClub Hell yeah
1,@PPathole @SpaceX @4thFromOurStar Sure hope so!
1,@Gfilche Physics ftw
1,@flcnhvy These are nice; but high time we built a really big Tesla coil!
1,@WholeMarsBlog Cells &amp; FSD are massive; the rest is just beauty &amp; romance … but life is empty without those last two
1,@shortword Yeah; headlights are precision LED; so they can be bright without blinding oncoming traffic; pedestrians &amp; cyclists
1,@truth_tesla It will hopefully achieve sustained cycle time of 45 seconds. At 75% uptime over an average week; that’s ~10k/week if run 24/7.
1,@teslaownersSV Sunday/Monday
1,A few last minute concerns about this build. Release likely on Sunday or Monday. Sorry for the delay.
1,@LifeofMikej @TeslaOwnersBC @DriveTeslaca @Tesla @Teslarati There are many small joys as you explore the car &amp; more to come via software updates
1,@Model3Owners So crazy to have come this far!
1,@Tesmanian_com Exactly
1,If you’d like to join Tesla AI; but can’t easily move to Palo Alto or Austin; that is acceptable for extremely excellent candidates where inefficiency of distance is overcome by talent
1,Sorry if we’ve been too dumb to respond to you. Please cite evidence of exceptional ability in a few bullet points. Nothing else matters.
1,Please consider joining Tesla AI software or hardware teams! https://t.co/HgigdtenKN
1,@PeterDiamandis I’m so dying to do a supersonic; electric VOTL jet; but adding more work will make my 🧠 🧨
1,Starlink is designed for low to medium population density; which means we can hit max users in some areas fast.   Please sign up early to ensure a spot. As more satellites roll out; SpaceX will be able to serve more.   https://t.co/Q1VvqVmJ2i
1,@jc_comrade Should be nationwide rollout by end of month. Note; still limited by peak number of users in same area.   This will improve as more satellites are launched.
1,@GerberKawasaki Haha true
1,@johnkrausphotos Definitely further refinements coming to (early beta) safety test score. It will be refined continuously until it is an extremely good predictor of crash probability. Exciting actuarial problem!
1,@lexfridman Sure
1,@Teslarati @13ericralph31 It’s a big deal that Dragon is reusable; with improved refurbishment efficiency with each passing flight! This is not the case for other orbital spacecraft.  It means the spacefleet grows every time a new Dragon is made.
1,@probablyup Long list of mostly little items; but driving experience is significantly better. We will put notable changes in the release notes.
1,@jgrano305 Everyone with a perfect score with get it. There are ~1000 owners with perfect scores. Maybe 1100 to 1200 by Friday night.
1,@TeslaClubWI Note; quality of experience can vary dramatically; as our neural nets have far more training data in some parts of the country than others; but this should improve rapidly with more driving in those regions.
1,@SahilBloom Try explaining it to a 17-month-old – that’s hard!
1,FSD Beta 10.2 rolls out Friday midnight to ~1000 owners with perfect 100/100 safety scores.   Rollouts will hold for several days after that to see how it goes.   If that looks good; beta will gradually begin rolling out to 99 scores &amp; below.
1,@cleantechnica Tesla always pays its debts
1,@Teslarati @KlenderJoey This was *extremely* difficult. Huge props to Tesla engineering; supply chain; production &amp; key suppliers.
1,@TheStonkJunky Awesome; effortless ordering is our goal :)
1,@PPathole Tough choice – so many great movies –but Spaceballs for me
1,@vm_one1 Lookin good …
1,Walk this way … no; *this* way … https://t.co/5DHEOh9Rke
1,@SawyerMerritt I wish I had had the opportunity to talk to him
1,@YoshikiOfficial @Benioff @netflix @TIME @hiromichimizuno @inspiration4x Same
1,@28delayslater Good point; will discuss with team. Floki pic tomorrow.
1,@Real_Futurist @flcnhvy @inspiration4x New Dune is good
1,@flcnhvy @inspiration4x I really wanted to like it
1,Amazing show about @Inspiration4x mission! https://t.co/0nQua4jGiz
1,@alex_avoigt Manufacturing will be Tesla’s long-term competitive strength
1,This is real btw
1,And thanks very much to our suppliers &amp; logistics partners for coming through despite great difficulties!
1,@RocketLab360 Will be Falcon 9 size sooner or later
1,@CStyles45 @Tesla Pushed a week to align with 10.2
1,With https://t.co/45B5nUBaxb &amp; Powerwall battery you are your own utility.   24/7 clean; sustainable electricity.
1,@astro_kimbrough @SpaceX Hello @Space_Station; great pic! (That’s me waving)
1,@Tesmanian_com That is the goal
1,@LabPadre Proof was good!
1,@pcgamer AMD has been great to work with!
1,@Gfilche @freshjiva No guarantees; but I think it will. This is  a big part of what I meant by Tesla’s long-term competitive advantage being manufacturing technology.
1,@thesheetztweetz SpaceX has sued to be *allowed* to compete; BO is suing to stop competition
1,@SPACEdotcom Maxwell was incredible
1,@mortenlund89 Really?
1,@BillyM2k Hamster has mad skillz!!
1,@slashdot This is a serious concern.
1,@SciGuySpace @Neopork85 @NASASpaceflight We aim to do the most for the least $
1,Apologies; 10.2 release will be a week from Friday
1,@BLKMDL3 First few days probably 100/100; then 99; 98; etc.
1,Wow; lot of interest in FSD beta! Plan is to roll out version 10.2 midnight Friday; then on-ramp ~1000 owners/day; prioritized by safety rating.
1,@Erdayastronaut @LabPadre If tiles are not super thin; you get hot plasma “waterfalling” off edges of tiles; creating hotspots.   That said; I’m not entirely convinced that this couldn’t be done with several overlapping scales of metal sheet with an insulator between scale armor &amp; primary structure.
1,@LabPadre Headed tank vent knocked off a few tiles
1,@scott_peak Cybertruck option package
1,@scott_peak Of course
1,@Rainmaker1973 Where is Hitchcock when you need him?
1,@Rainmaker1973 Illustrates why Tesla sales will soon exceed mass of universe
1,@alex_avoigt In an electric future; batteries are as essential to transport as oil is today
1,@wadeanderson Noted. You should be able to press mic button &amp; say “bug report …”
1,@kimpaquette A helpful case to consider; as the roads intersect at unusual angles
1,@pcgamer True
1,@bluemoondance74 @NASASpaceflight @SpaceX “Comes in discreet packaging”
1,@cnunezimages @SpaceX Well ya see we need to reach around the rocket to uhh …
1,@Sushihunter2 @pitt_geoff @rajz06 @Tesla @Everman We use no cobalt at all in most of our cars &amp; tiny amounts in others (going to zero soon); whereas phones &amp; laptops primarily use cobalt
1,@RenataKonkoly @Erdayastronaut And booster used to be 70m; but this required an awkward half barrel width of steel; so now it’s 69m
1,@Nick_Stevens_Gr Haha so true of rocket engine development
1,@WholeMarsBlog Very much a beta calculation. It will evolve over time to more accurately predict crash probability.
1,FSD Beta request button goes live tonight; but FSD 10.1 needs another 24 hours of testing; so out tomorrow night
1,@thesheetztweetz Chris was an early employee of SpaceX; and made a significant contribution; but was not a cofounder
1,@SpaceXMR Maybe reality is a Rick &amp; Morty episode
1,@RenataKonkoly @FelixSchlang @KathyLueders @SpaceX @BoeingSpace I didn’t think so at the time
1,@thesheetztweetz So pointy! https://t.co/XMRQKpmy0t
1,@BillyM2k Super important for Doge fees to drop to make things like buying movie tix viable
1,@EvaFoxU @ChesterNoBS @truth_tesla Giga Berlin will help a lot
1,@SueOrigin @SciGuySpace That would break the NASA budget!
1,@simongerman600 @waitbutwhy @SeppalaVilleEN Birth rate collapse is the biggest threat to human civilization
1,@wapodavenport We always do flight readiness reviews! This argument makes no sense.
1,@EvaFoxU @ChesterNoBS @truth_tesla Logistics is underrated
1,@EvaFoxU @ChesterNoBS @truth_tesla Exactly. Giga Shanghai makes cars for export in first half of quarter; then cars for far away parts of China; then cars for nearby parts of China.   Net result is a crazy wave of deliveries end of quarter. It is tough on our team; so we’re hoping to reduce the wave in Q4 &amp; Q1.
1,@rookisaacman @ArceneauxHayley @DrSianProctor @ChrisSembroski @inspiration4x @StJude Great view of Earth!
1,@HistoryInPics Tesla is the king of car farts!
1,@ro_ma_vive @cybrtrkguy Hopefully worldwide long-term; but insurance is a regulatory labyrinth/escape room!
1,@cybrtrkguy The regulatory process for approval to offer insurance is extremely slow &amp; complex; varying considerably by state.   Tesla is hoping to offer real-time (based on actual driving history) insurance in Texas next month.  Probably next year before we get approval in New York.
1,@ElectricRaph @28delayslater @KounisTou Good point; we could enable visualization before control. Will enable that option hopefully next month.
1,@TeslaOwnersEBay @TeslaGong @inspiration4x Definitely upgraded toilets :) We had some challenges with it this flight.
1,@carsonight Not super surprising; given that internal combustion engine cars literally have “combustion” in the name
1,@TeslaGong @inspiration4x Yeah; a little oven for heating food &amp; Starlink wifi
1,Just met with the @Inspiration4x crew in Florida to congratulate them in person. Such great people!
1,@ray4tesla Tesla has not yet decided on a fourth Gigafactory location
1,@AustinTeslaClub To be precise; completely &amp; immediately reusable orbital rockets are the fundamental breakthrough needed to make life multiplanetary
1,@teslaownersSV @Tesla Which games did they like most?
1,@tegmark Nice work!
1,@teslaownersSV @TeslaGong @WholeMarsBlog Good
1,@TeslaGong @teslaownersSV @WholeMarsBlog No; has to be turned on by car owner
1,@teslaownersSV @WholeMarsBlog Tesla insurance calculator will show status in real-time &amp; tell you what actions are needed to be rated “good driver”
1,@BLKMDL3 @WholeMarsBlog 7 days after approval to log driving style
1,@starbasergv Not a tiny engine
1,@WholeMarsBlog Remarkable how few people realize this capability exists. Many think it is 5 years away! With public beta rollout in coming weeks; awareness should improve dramatically.
1,@FiveTweetTSLA @tesla_lion @archillect Seems that way
1,@archillect Looks fine. Take 2 aspirin; call me in the morning.
1,@TheMarsSociety @NASA Some amount of cooperation would be good
1,@RenataKonkoly @rhensing @johnkrausphotos Absolutely
1,@rhensing He’s still sleeping
1,@stats_feed Needs a little warming up
1,@AustinTeslaClub @Tesla @TeslaOwnersEBay @TeslaOwnersUAE @EvaFoxU @leastImAlive @teslaownersSV @gailalfa1 @live_munro @OwenSparks_ I wish there were more
1,@AustinTeslaClub @Tesla @TeslaOwnersEBay @TeslaOwnersUAE @EvaFoxU @leastImAlive @teslaownersSV @gailalfa1 @live_munro @OwenSparks_ So few products that you truly love 💕
1,@inspiration4x @ArceneauxHayley @rookisaacman @DrSianProctor @ChrisSembroski @StJude Count me in for $50M
1,Congratulations @Inspiration4x!!!
1,@OwenSparks_ @ChrisSembroski One of my favorite movies
1,@TeslaGong @BryceSpaceTech Yes  No; but it will get refilled &amp; maybe cargo transfer
1,@enn_nafnlaus @BryceSpaceTech Making life multiplanetary is an extremely hard; but not impossible; problem
1,@BryceSpaceTech Still basically nothing compared to the orbital mass flux needed for a base on moon or Mars
1,@kittynouveau Probably will trap a Tesla with the production Autopilot build; but won’t work with FSD. Using a ring of cones would stop FSD though.
1,@NevanRead @A11electric It will be there
1,@slashdot Sigh
1,@SamTwits @Erdayastronaut @PPathole @vincent13031925 Long chain hydrocarbons; like kerosene; have excellent volumetric energy density; but what you really want for rockets is best way to bind hydrogen; which is CH4.   Also; easy to make &amp; store CH4+O2 from CO2+H2O; which are abundant on Mars.
1,@Erdayastronaut @PPathole @vincent13031925 Fully reusable rockets want high T/W to minimize $/ton to orbit; because propellant cost actually matters
1,@WholeMarsBlog Automatically drive to most obvious location unless occupant says otherwise
1,@WatchersTank @SpaceX With that; Ship is basically begging for an extra 3 engines
1,@Aristot21520213 @ray4tesla Exactly
1,@ignaciobelieres @oza_shiv @lrocket “Ignition!”
1,@oza_shiv @lrocket Throw in some hydrogen &amp; lithium for a real party
1,@lrocket What propellant?
1,Moving at ~23 times speed of sound; circling Earth every ~90 minutes
1,@hiromichimizuno Ironically; yes at this time. FSD beta system at times can seem so good that vigilance isn’t necessary; but it is. Also; any beta user who isn’t super careful will get booted.   2000 beta users operating for almost a year with no accidents. Needs to stay that way.
1,@Erdayastronaut @inspiration4x Yeah. We’d use our Ka parabolics or laser links for Dragon; Starship or other spacecraft as soon as they got above cloud level.
1,@TeslaNY Jay is right
1,Please add your voice to the public comments. Support is greatly appreciated!   Humanity’s future on the moon; Mars &amp; beyond depends upon it.  Thanks;  Elon
1,@TrungTPhan The lesson from “tortoise &amp; hare” is not that tortoises are faster; but rather that hares should not be complacent
1,@cleantechnica September will be interesting
1,@StianWalgermo Technology probably ready in a few months; thereafter limited by regulatory approval
1,@IvanEscobosa Beta button will request permission to assess driving behavior using Tesla insurance calculator. If driving behavior is good for 7 days; beta access will be granted.
1,@OvershieId Next month
1,Good feedback from FSD Beta 10 users! 10.0.1 point release rolling out now.   10.1 rolls out a week from Friday with beta request button.
1,@EliBurton_ @SpaceX @zubinanary @MyTeslaAdventur Truth is stranger than fiction
1,@XHNews Congratulations on a successful mission!
1,@pcgamer RIP; Sir Sinclair. I loved that computer.
1,Just spoke with @inspiration4x crew. All is well.
1,@lexfridman @SpaceX Missions like Inspiration4 help advance spaceflight to enable ultimately anyone to go to orbit &amp; beyond
1,@jack That’s my safe word too
1,@teslaownersSV Maneuverability is important for safety
1,@richardbranson @SpaceX @inspiration4x Thanks Richard!
1,@JeffBezos @SpaceX Thank you
1,@inspiration4x @ChrisSembroski @rookisaacman @DrSianProctor @ArceneauxHayley It was an honor to wish you Godspeed before you left for orbit!
1,Watch Countdown on Netflix about Inspiration4 mission launching today
1,@thesheetztweetz @NASAKennedy @SpaceX It is hard to overstate criticality of reusable rockets. No less important than reusable aircraft; cars or bicycles.  Essential for humanity to become a multiplanet species &amp; backup the biosphere.
1,@RationalEtienne It has indeed become hard to find which platform has which show
1,@Gfilche I’m not saying there are UFOs … but there are UFOs
1,@Gfilche Also; we need to figure out how to render voxel height of unknown objects in a way that isn’t horrendous
1,@Dogeshade Deep
1,Whether it’s stamp collectors in Andorra or petticoat aficionados in Lichtenstein; none can resist!
1,@boringcompany Nice work!
1,Nicheman (power of appealing to niche audiences) strikes again hahaha
1,Emojilution https://t.co/oXfiGkpdkO
1,@PPathole They are … not yet friends
1,@flcnhvy Ok ok haha
1,@28delayslater Will do!
1,Floki has arrived https://t.co/2MiUKb91FT
1,@WholeMarsBlog @POTUS (Ahem)
1,@BLKMDL3 @WholeMarsBlog Literally!
1,@Matt_Lowne Forward flaps will change a lot in upcoming versions of Starship – smaller &amp; more leeward
1,@WholeMarsBlog This is written by Ford/UAW lobbyists; as they make their electric car in Mexico. Not obvious how this serves American taxpayers.  https://t.co/FUUXARHlby
1,@OliOnOrbit Falcon 9 is technically a heavy lift rocket. If flown as an expendable; payload to orbit is similar to Delta IV Heavy (~25 tons to LEO).  And Starship is ~10 times bigger.
1,@TeslaPodcast Nice drive
1,@ICannot_Enough @garyblack00 With 10.1; it will creep forward with more confidence &amp; quickly reverse back a little (just as a person would) if it sees danger
1,@FrenchieEAP Think of Beta 10 as enabling a significantly higher local maximum than Beta 9
1,@WholeMarsBlog To be fair; investors are giving us significant credit for achieving self-driving; given that Tesla’s valuation/production is very high compared to other automakers
1,@BLKMDL3 @teslaownersSV Three weeks
1,@teslaownersSV Digital clock coming in 2 weeks
1,@TimSweeneyEpic Please challenge Tim of Apple to trial by combat 🙏
1,@TimSweeneyEpic Didn’t you sorta win? https://t.co/eNu5Oh9Ogx
1,@Teslarati @ResidentSponge Highway stack is still production version; as it is more polished than FSD for now. Single stack for all should release in 10.1.
1,@SpaceX These are V1.5 Starlinks with laser inter-satellite links; which are needed for high latitudes &amp; mid ocean coverage
1,@JeffTutorials An early season episode of the Tesla soap opera!
1,@nuerburgring @Tesla Great work by Tesla team; with special thanks to Tesla Automation in Prüm; who were critical to many high-performance parts of Plaid!
1,@4sanjaymathew @thesheetztweetz @esa @AschbacherJosef @SpaceX @SpireGlobal Exactly. Getting paid by the government to launch payloads at much lower prices than competitors is not “government support”.
1,@TGMetsFan98 @NASASpaceflight Satellites with “lasers” in “space” [strokes white cat]
1,@Teslarati @13ericralph31 @SpacePadreIsle Booster static fire on orbital launch mount hopefully next week
1,@BLKMDL3 Track software update probably a few weeks away (I know; I know haha). Also waypoints &amp; other things.
1,@AaronS5_ Tesla doesn’t have the bandwidth to do it; but there are some good third party mod shops
1,Next will be modified Plaid with added aero surfaces; carbon brakes &amp; track tires (all things that can be done without Tesla being in the loop)
1,Tesla Model S Plaid just set official world speed record for a production electric car at Nurburgring. Completely unmodified; directly from factory. https://t.co/AaiFtfW5Ht
1,@burkov Maybe not; but it’s 99% dot products
1,@WholeMarsBlog The build I’m driving right now is almost there. FSD 10 will blow your mind.
1,@WholeMarsBlog Expansion will be gradual; based on ensuring maximum safety
1,@28delayslater @slashdot Am I a yoke to you? 😢
1,@28delayslater @slashdot Yet another round wheel is boring &amp; blocks the screen. FSD in panoramic mode looks way better with a yoke.
1,@slashdot Just messin with ya haha
1,@TeslaGong @Neuro_Skeptic Are you the same today as you were yesterday?
1,@Neuro_Skeptic It seems to be working … https://t.co/tE6OVu7IQq
1,@Kristennetten Cybertruck is not like the others
1,@PPathole That sums it up well!
1,@Rogozin Thanks! What is your favorite tea?
1,@SaycheeseDGTL And if it doesn’t work; he’s gonna sue death!
1,@latestengineer Impressive!
1,@stefanolaru Worth it
1,@RenataKonkoly @flcnhvy @JeffTutorials Many times
1,@flcnhvy @JeffTutorials That’s one of my tests!
1,@WholeMarsBlog I’m not always late haha
1,@anthonyisonline Large incumbent carmakers sell their cars at low to zero true margin. Most of their profit is selling replacement parts to their fleet; of which 70% to 80% are past warranty.   Like razors &amp; blades.  New car companies lack this advantage. Also lack sales &amp; service infrastructure.
1,@anthonyisonline Production is hard. Production with positive cash flow is extremely hard.
1,@SP_LimitReviews @Tesla @CodingMark @Manic_Marge @teslainventory @WholeMarsBlog Lot of good work happening on Tesla sound codec &amp; audio software in general. Aiming for maximum music dopamine in your brain!
1,@TrungTPhan A lot has happened in the past 8 years
1,@flcnhvy @WholeMarsBlog @truth_tesla @LimitingThe This is obv debatable; but I’d call anything with ~300 miles / ~500 km of true usable travel distance “long range”; beyond that “very long range”
1,@WholeMarsBlog @truth_tesla @LimitingThe There are vast amounts of iron (and lithium) on Earth; but much less nickel.   For global industry to scale battery production to ~10 TWh/year; it needs to be mostly iron.  Higher energy density of Nickel only needed for very long range vehicles &amp; aircraft.
1,@truth_tesla @LimitingThe Our new cell is 46mm diameter with steel shell &amp; even that was huge challenge for propagation resistance
1,@truth_tesla @LimitingThe Yes.   Physics of large cells means distance from cooling loop to center of cell is high; so harder to prevent hotspots.  Then; pressure &amp; heat released from large cell in weak bag make it impossible to stop whole pack from burning.  Pretty basic.
1,Time is the ultimate currency
1,@long_elon @LimitingThe Iron; the last element made in a star; appears likely to exceed nickel by 3:1 or more
1,@LimitingThe Generally agree; but probability of thermal runaway is dangerously high with large pouch cells. Tesla strongly recommends against their use.
1,@teslaownersSV And Beta 10 is a step change improvement from what you have!
1,@leastImAlive @archillect 🤣🤣 “I’m fkn tryin”
1,@TeslaAIBot @EffinZach Ur welcome; pls be nice to the humans
1,@archillect Smoked ham
1,@dogecoin_devs Good progress. Applying information theory to currency (which is just information); lower fees reduce noise &amp; faster &amp; more consistent sync time improve latency &amp; jitter.
1,@EffinZach The robots are coming anyway; as Boston Dynamics videos clearly show.   I will not be able to ensure that robots made by other companies are safe; but I can try my best to do so at Tesla.
1,@thesheetztweetz @SquawkStreet In general; I believe government should rarely impose its will upon the people; and; when doing so; should aspire to maximize their cumulative happiness. That said; I would prefer to stay out of politics.
1,@DJSnM @thesheetztweetz @johnkrausphotos @LylaKohistany Processing is not an issue. Lasers links alleviate ground station constraints; so data can go from say Sydney to London through space; which is ~40% faster speed of light than fiber &amp; shorter path.   Also; no need for ground stations everywhere. Arctic will have great bandwidth!
1,@tobyliiiiiiiiii Not sure; but maybe a few months. In general for any region; we need to make software work well; test it extensively &amp; then get regulatory approval. If we could go faster while being safe; we would!

1,FSD Beta 10 rolls out midnight Friday next week
1,@Kristennetten @StianWalgermo @Tesla @ARKInvest @WholeMarsBlog @alex_avoigt @Teslarati @TeslaPodcast @mortenlund89 I was in the Berlin paint shop talking to the team on my last visit. It’s gonna be great!   But bear in mind that it takes about a year for a new factory to reach volume production. Production is super hard work; which is why I have great respect for those who do it.

1,@DJSnM @thesheetztweetz @johnkrausphotos @LylaKohistany Technically; data packets do not need to touch regular Internet – data can flow from user terminal to satellite/s to user terminal
1,@DJSnM @thesheetztweetz @johnkrausphotos @LylaKohistany Our satellites launching in next few months have inter-satellite laser links; so no local downlink needed. Probably active in 4 to 6 months.

1,@NASASpaceflight Hopefully first try with booster 5
1,@Astro_Elliott @PPathole Tank treads on the arms
1,@PPathole Booster has 2 pins for lifting &amp; catching; although maybe it’s better to modify grid fins to take more load.   Something will need to flip out from leeward side of top of ship to do same there. Maybe it’s part of fwd flaps; but prob not.  Diff solutions for diff load paths.

1,On now
1,@vincent13031925 Will make a big difference
1,@Erdayastronaut @Caspar_Stanley No; bottom static aero pushes engine section back; counteracting Starship’s low center of mass on reentry caused by the engine section.   Aiming for 60 to 70 deg angle of attack during high heating portion of flight. Don’t want to reenter with engines blasted by plasma.
1,@zone_astronomy Low center of mass. Bit like our ship &amp; booster on reentry.
1,@GerberKawasaki Same
1,@Erdayastronaut @Caspar_Stanley Probably slightly further forward; smaller; more inward. No funny looking static aero at top; as static aero no longer directly in flow.
1,@Erdayastronaut Btw; there’s a slight error with forward flap design. Moving section is needed for control; but passive section is counter-productive; as it pushes nose backwards.   New design rotates fwd flaps more to leeward &amp; further forward to improve moment arm. Maybe ~120 deg apart.

Mars is a lot harder; because Earth &amp; Mars only align every 26 months; so ship reuse is limited to ~dozen times over 25 to 30 year life of ship.

1,@wapodavenport Note; should be “refill”; not “refuel”. ~78% of propellant is liquid oxygen; only ~22% is fuel.
1,@CathieDWood Tesla makes cars for export in first half of quarter &amp; for local market in second half.   As publicly disclosed; we are operating under extreme supply chain limitations regarding certain “standard” automotive chips.   Most problematic by far are Renesas &amp; Bosch.
1,@considercosmos @SpaceX Booster &amp; Ship will return to orbital launch pad on Monday (winds allowing). Just finishing off some small plumbing &amp; wiring; which is easier in high bay.
1,@RationalEtienne @Erdayastronaut I hope I do
1,@spacex360 If lobbying &amp; lawyers could get u to orbit; Bezos would be on Pluto rn
1,@spacex360 Exactly
1,@wapodavenport Somehow; this wasn’t convincing … https://t.co/qAn8Y6i5Ys
1,@Teslarati @KlenderJoey I’d recommend they get their first plant working. It’s insanely difficult to reach volume production at affordable unit cost.
1,@Teslarati @ResidentSponge It’s gonna be awesome
1,@wapodavenport However; even if it were 16 flights with docking; this is not a problem. SpaceX did more than 16 orbital flights in first half of 2021 &amp; has docked with Station (much harder than docking with our own ship) over 20 times.
1,@wapodavenport 16 flights is extremely unlikely. Starship payload to orbit is ~150 tons ; so max of 8 to fill 1200 ton tanks of lunar Starship.  Without flaps &amp; heat shield; Starship is much lighter. Lunar landing legs don’t add much (1/6 gravity). May only need 1/2 full; ie 4 tanker flights.
1,@lrocket @thesheetztweetz Yeah
1,@cleantechnica Important to bear in mind that production is as fast as the slowest part out of ~10;000 unique parts in a car
1,@thesheetztweetz SpaceX could do it if need be

1,@Kristennetten @SpaceX It will be exciting to see what new cultures humanity creates on other heavenly bodies!
1,@Dr_ThomasZ @thesheetztweetz @SpaceX Due to its size &amp; ability to return science instruments even from deep space; Starship will enable a whole new class of science missions
1,Minus the lifts https://t.co/kokDQQymhN
1,@WholeMarsBlog @NASASpaceflight @BBCAmos There is a reason no fully reusable orbital rocket has been built – it’s an insanely hard problem.   Moreover; it must be rapidly &amp; completely reusable (like an airplane). This is the only way to make life multiplanetary.  Efficiencies of scale is why Starship is so large.
1,@WholeMarsBlog @NASASpaceflight @BBCAmos Higher structural margins overall are needed for reuse; plus:  Booster - Grid fins for aero control - Boostback &amp; landing propellant tanks - Protecting engines from entry loads  Ship - Body flaps for aero control - Deorbit &amp; landing propellant tanks - Heat shield
1,@Astro_Elliott @NASASpaceflight @BBCAmos Inevitably
1,@NASASpaceflight @BBCAmos Over time; we might get orbital payload up to ~150 tons with full reusabity. If Starship then launched as an expendable; payload would be ~250 tons. What isn’t obvious from this chart is that Starship/Super Heavy is much denser than Saturn V.
1,@thesheetztweetz It is ~98% done; but the remaining tiles are unique shapes requiring machining
1,@thesheetztweetz 4 significant items:  - Final heat shield tiles for ship - Thermal protection of booster engines - Ground propellant storage tanks - QD arm for ship  2 weeks.
1,@thesheetztweetz Dream come true
1,@jrosinski97 @SpaceX Absolutely
1,Starship Fully Stacked https://t.co/Fs88RNsmfH
1,@IvanEscobosa @ajtourville @Tesla Probably
1,@ajtourville @Tesla Tesla Automation (Deutschland) built a specialized machine to wrap the rotor with carbon fiber at precise tension.   If too low; it would come loose at low temp; due to CTE differences. If too high; it would snap at high temp &amp; rpm.
1,@austinbarnard45 Total coincidence! Also; booster height was originally 70m; but we eliminated a half barrel for manufacturing efficiency; so now it’s …
1,@jack DMTwitter
1,@ChrisDungeon Reality is total opposite of what detractors say! Biggest challenge is recruiting enough people to build cars.   SF Bay Area essentially has negative unemployment; so people at our factory have several other job offers. If they weren’t treated well; they would leave immediately!
1,@techvamp Once Mechazilla is operational; winds will rarely be an issue
1,Winds are too high today. Looks like wind speed will be low enough to stack early tomorrow morning.

1,All 6 engines mounted to first orbital Starship https://t.co/l5QnQRSg3D
1,@teslaownersSV @NASA I thought we had lost for sure. We were just a tiny company back then; only 1 of 4 launches got to orbit &amp; I had no money left. Out of the blue; a few days before Christmas; NASA calls to say we won.
1,@teslaownersSV @NASA Just want to say thanks to those in government who fight hard for the right thing to happen; despite extreme pressure to do otherwise.   Therein lies the core goodness of the American state.
1,@teslaownersSV @NASA I do love NASA; always have
1,@teslaownersSV @NASA It’s true
1,@PPathole Mars looks amazing
1,@Erdayastronaut @ErcXspace We stole the idea from Karate Kid
1,@flcnhvy Pitch control requires more force than yaw &amp; much more force than roll. Also; grid fins closer to or in the wake of the booster are less effective.   However; pretty good aero control can technically be achieved with only 2 grid fins; with some effect on accuracy.
1,@TeslaFruit Thanks Sandy!
1,Super Heavy Booster moving to orbital launch mount https://t.co/axaDnXNm84
1,@ErcXspace Very close to real! Arms are able to move during descent to match exact booster position.   Catch point is off to side; in case catch fails – don’t want to hit launch mount.   Booster is transferred back to launch mount for next flight.   Designed to have &lt;1 hour turnaround.
1,@stem_feed That’s about right. Civilization can be powered with a very small % of Earth having solar panels.

1,@Erdayastronaut @PPathole @austinbarnard45 @LabPadre Rockets &amp; spacecraft have to operate in vacuum; so maintaining pressure is fundamental. However; this can be made very safe over time imo.
1,@Erdayastronaut @PPathole @austinbarnard45 @LabPadre There are redundant pressure control valves. It’s a new system and SN3 was simply commanded wrong. Rockets are hard.
1,@Erdayastronaut @PPathole @austinbarnard45 @LabPadre If you lose pressure control on rocket propellant tanks; you’re doomed anyway; so might as well go all in
1,We’re adding this here catchy tune to the music maker in the Tesla!
1,@PPathole @austinbarnard45 @LabPadre Pretty much. Good news is that this was a test configuration error; rather than a design or build mistake. Not enough pressure in the LOX tank ullage to maintain stability with a heavy load in the CH4 tank. This was done with N2.

1,@bittdk Better. Not there yet; but a solution is likely.
1,Most recent rocket took max damage; due to v high entry velocity. Will be our life leader for ground tests to confirm others are good.

1,@iwritethewrong It's probably the Ambien
1,Definitely https://t.co/7gEkc0mt9O
1,Full credit to the team that's doing this. All happening without any help from me.  https://t.co/FAZE01lleA
1,@vicentes @TeslaMotors @Tim_Stevens @CNET coming soon
1,@tzepr Certainly agree that it is first and foremost a triumph for humanity. The cheering is in good spirit.
1,@LifeOfRockstar I think so
1,@lukealization Max is just 3X Merlin thrust and min is ~40% of 1 Merlin. Two outer engines shut off before the center does.
1,I love you too! https://t.co/Cnmd7cONU3
1,Launch trajectory of Japanese commercial satellite JCSat-14; enroute to 36;000 km above Earth https://t.co/QHiiMdMMJ3
1,@hansmikael @TeslaMotors Thank goodness all are ok
1,Yeah; this was a three engine landing burn; so triple deceleration of last flight. That's important to minimize gravity losses.
1,May need to increase size of rocket storage hangar
1,Woohoo!! https://t.co/0P8n8VmFbr
1,Rocket reentry is a lot faster and hotter than last time; so odds of making it are maybe even; but we should learn a lot either way
1,Tesla is increasing the production ramp as fast as possible; but I'd recommend ordering a Model 3 soon if you want 2018 delivery
1,Filtering particulates from air makes a significant &amp; measurable diff to health. Wd like to credit Larry Page with turning me on to this.
1,Bioweapon Defense Mode is real https://t.co/xGNLrOyhaQ This is what happens when you turn it on: https://t.co/LnkHzXTxqN
1,@MacTechGenius @SacEV Have been reviewing end of line production quality personally. Slowed things down temporarily; but it's for the best.
1,@JohanMancus Historical precedent. Mars vehicle will be metric.

1,@scottymeuk @DericLew @SpaceflightIns @phillipcjackson exactly
1,@_andyoneal sides def; center maybe
1,@CyberdineX naturally
1,Falcon Heavy thrust will be 5.1M lbf at liftoff --  twice any rocket currently flying. It's a beast...
1,F9 thrust at liftoff will be raised to 1.71M lbf later this year. It is capable of 1.9M lbf in flight.
1,@lukealization No cross feed. It would help performance; but is not needed for these numbers.
1,@lukealization No physical changes to the engine. This thrust increase is based on delta qual tests. It is just tougher than we thought.
1,@elonmusk Max performance numbers are for expendable launches. Subtract 30% to 40% for reusable booster payload.
1,@mattyteare Basically current; but higher throttle setting. Good performance of recent launches allows us to reduce 3 sigma reserve margin.
1,Just posted latest max payload capabilities of Falcon 9 and Heavy https://t.co/Z45Y5V7G91
1,@phillipcjackson turns out it doesn't need securing
1,@vicentes @gdoehne yes; several times
1,@jbdeck for sure :)
1,@Tweetermeyer things like this should be purged shortly
1,@RokBottomGamers 100+ for almost everything 10+ for heat shields and a few other items.
1,@VivekMGeorge Zuck doesn't (yet) have a deep tech understanding of AI. I spend hours every week being educated by world's best researchers.
1,@gdoehne JCSat is pushing the envelope as a very hot and fast mission; so will land on the droneship. Next land landing in a few months.
1,@MrBoylan System scan detected only 0.2% of orders with same email and physical address. Those have been purged.
1,@vigneshraju of course
1,@maya_kazan Temporary spike in some areas due to X 3rd row seat recall. Should be sorted by June.
1,@MrBoylan Duplicates will be cancelled. Max of 2 will be delivered to any one person. Only ~5% of orders are 2; so speculation unlikely.
1,@erothenberg Simple answer is that there just aren't many used Teslas available. Demand &gt;&gt; supply.
1,@erothenberg checking into it ...
1,@romn8tr will definitely do so
1,@abraham_cavazos some places are trickier than others; but yes. That's the value of having a PICA-3 heat shield with propulsive landing.
1,@Cardoso It could land on Venus no problem; but would last maybe a few hours. Tough local environment.
1,But wouldn't recommend transporting astronauts beyond Earth-moon region. Wouldn't be fun for longer journeys. Internal volume ~size of SUV.
1,Dragon 2 is designed to be able to land anywhere in the solar system. Red Dragon Mars mission is the first test flight.
1,@KristianNairn A 3 should be workable; but an S or particularly an X would be better
1,@scottmcnealy That article was incredibly misleading and you should know it. Wager right now that Sun has received far more than Tesla?
1,Looks like Model X resale value is holding up well :) https://t.co/4gedy9GCHA
1,@dannysparker Aiming for relaunch in 3 to 4 months; pending detailed examination and 10X refiring of a returned booster

1,@thelonelyisland Well; I thought TLI might be upset about using their material without permission. Apparently not :)
1,@TheHackersNews @SpaceX Thanks
1,@levie Tickets to orbital hotels; the moon and Mars will be a lot less than people think.
1,Just wanted to write a note of appreciation for all those who have supported Tesla; SpaceX &amp; SolarCity over the years. Thank you.
1,@Jon_Favreau @SpaceX Thanks!
1,@NASA @sgvcrime @SpaceX @Space_Station Thanks for your support! Looking forward to delivering the goods for you.
1,"Screen cap from the stern cam of droneship ""Of Course I Still Love You"" https://t.co/4rGOJMTzVn"
1,@arstechnica Reasons for ocean landing are technical; not economic. Orbit requires extreme horizontal velocity. Getting to space needs none.
1,SolarCity panels produce enough zero carbon energy to charge entire Tesla fleet https://t.co/bn4LRzii1V
1,@nonesuchzach Nickel is also in nickels
1,@nonesuchzach Battery uses no rare Earth metals. Main ingredient is nickel; which is what's used to coat cutlery; so very non-toxic.
1,Over 325k cars or ~$14B in preorders in first week. Only 5% ordered max of two; suggesting low levels of speculation.
1,@samboykin @danahull the only thing beyond ludicrous is plaid
1,@jpfrappier yes; will go all the way to Alaska
1,@Recode Dex will do comms; but my speeches are just a conversation w the audience. No time to rehearse &amp; don't want to read from a prompter.
1,@maximumblue we will
1,@LaurenShearer1 Doesn't sound right. Will check into it.
1,@MThorpXXi We are working on enlarging the opening. Aperture will be big enough for almost anything.

1,Model X review https://t.co/IS2zBgDlqn
1,@Brianmrtz probably unwise
1,@Christiano92 @Inspron @Jerry22499879 won't be a hatchback; but we should be able to increase the opening width and height
1,@morganpage sounds good
1,Signing off from impromptu Twitter AMA. Thanks for the suggestions. Btw; we really will have more cow bells.
1,@lordsshrivas Coming soon for all Tesla cars. Just an OTA software update.
1,@GonzaloBolio yes; coming this year
1,@AmarnathRevanna Air suspension dynamically adjusts ride height
1,@GatorWass you can do that now with S and X. Will be same for 3.
1,@_elombardo @rjpryan correct
1,@PeteEhmKay @gerardomarina what's the link to that?
1,@tapwin No; but we will need to build a factory in Europe to serve long-term regional demand as Fremont reaches max capacity.
1,@mpatfield no problem
1,@CrackedUpCorson Will cover whole country hopefully this year
1,@AlexBelohlavek less
1,@torvos torque is shifted between front &amp; rear motors every ~.01 secs. Traction control is way better than a normal AWD. Digital vs analog.
1,And; of course; it will have more cowbells.
1,Model 3 will be RWD; with dual motor AWD optional. Even RWD will have great traction on ice due to fast torque response of Tesla drivetrain.
1,@Zooropa88 @TeslaMotors Superchargers and service centers will cover all of Italy later this year
1,@_Only_Hawk @MICHAELSD01 @TechGrlTweeter definitely
1,@Alandbru @TeslaMotors should be addressed this year
1,@CmaxVs Only way to get enough rear passenger headroom was to move the rear roof cross-car support beam. A bike will still fit no problem.
1,@iKrivetko that's not the real steering system
1,@B_Rans yes. Will easily fit two child seats. Three if you buy slim seats.
1,@gerardomarina Some tweaking underway
1,@HBL_Cosmin Wait until you see the real steering controls and system for the 3. It feels like a spaceship.
1,@MICHAELSD01 @TechGrlTweeter Won't happen. Reason initial cars are delivered close to factory is to have rapid turnaround on early issues.
1,@scottkelley99 Edge and contour refinement are ongoing. Even .1mm matters.
1,@_amwolo_ They can. Will be great for road trips and camping
1,@BValvsRacing It will make sense after part 2 of the Model 3 unveil
1,A Model 3 order gives you priority in your geography; so; even tho total count is high; ordering early will make a big difference locally.
1,In general; product comments; suggestions and criticisms are always welcome
1,@SnoozeThroughF1 There will be an optional tow hitch.
1,@RGspan Our production ramp plan should enable large numbers of non X/S customers to receive the credit.
1,@WaltNew cool; thanks!
1,@mindthreat @RyanHummer Yes; if the trend continues; before
1,276k Model 3 orders by end of Sat
1,Model 3 design sketches https://t.co/P5ucOBRUZ7
1,@grebakshay We are working on an exact date; but Tesla will be in India before 3 production starts.
1,@Model3Owners They will. We spent a lot of time on those.
1,@vicentes Roadster; S and X customers are the ones who got us here and are paying for 3. They deserve a lot of credit.
1,@Aakashhh_ we will send something to everyone who ordered; but an extra gift for those who stood in some crazy long lines
1,@raytech247 yes; within a region. Can't deliver to all regions simultaneously. Too much complexity.
1,@squallcraft and a few other things
1,Token of appreciation for those who lined up coming via mail. Thought maybe 20-30 people per store would line up; not 800. Gifts on order.
1,@34thrain Maybe 1/4 to 1/2 of what happened. No one at Tesla thought it would be this high before part 2 of the unveil.
1,Will give an update tonight for the 3 day total; then last one on Wed for the full week. All efforts focused on accelerating the ramp.
1,253k as of 7am this morning
1,@sundarpichai thanks!
1,Now 232k orders
1,@GrahamABlair of course :)
1,@Jbourquee Giga is designed to self-power via solar panels (primarily); wind &amp; geo; using its own batteries to store electricity at night.
1,@JackLipstone should be within a week or two max
1,@Alyssa_Milano Hi Alyssa; thanks for placing your faith in Tesla. I hope you have a great experience with the car.
1,Definitely going to need to rethink production planning...
1,Thought it would slow way down today; but Model 3 order count is now at 198k. Recommend ordering soon; as the wait time is growing rapidly.
1,Model 3 orders at 180;000 in 24 hours. Selling price w avg option mix prob $42k; so ~$7.5B in a day. Future of electric cars looking bright!
1,@IndiaToday Will include India-wide Supercharger network
1,@Oatmeal sure!
1,@StartUpRabbi Coming in the mail
1,@redletterdave Hardware in all cars. Autopilot safety features standard. Convenience features optional (like S and X).

1,Congrats to DeepMind! Many experts in the field thought AI was 10 years away from achieving this. https://t.co/5gGZZkud3K
1,SpaceX &amp; Tesla comp is same or better than other companies. Big diff is that we don't outsource manufacturing; retail sales or service.
1,SpaceX and Tesla rated most meaningful work in high tech. Also; most stressful; but that goes with the territory.  https://t.co/y8s4UdMF5z

1,@SpaceX Launch aborted on low thrust alarm. Rising oxygen temps due to hold for boat and helium bubble triggered alarm.
1,@SpaceX AF has placed launch on hold due to a boat entering the edge of the keep out zone. Scrambling helo to get them to move.
1,@TLKFremont Great leg room for 3rd row; rear visibility better; easy storage of long cargo.
1,@derekslager @skiesforme yes; it actually performed better than other colors on stain tests. Best not to have vented seats w kids though.
1,@skiesforme Can't emphasize enough that white is the best interior. Also; pick 6 seats unless you really need 7.
1,@skiesforme @TeslaMotors That said; the white interior is the best. Highly recommend.
1,@skiesforme Heavy use of the white causes splitting. Adding backing material to strengthen. Will be upgraded at no cost.

1,@JeffBezos @SpaceX Thanks Jeff
1,Falcon lands on droneship; but the lockout collet doesn't latch on one the four legs; causing it… https://t.co/DpXsRQWal9
1,@JimmyVosika Actually; didn't get environmental approval in time; but it was also good practice for missions where a ship is needed.
1,If speed at stage separation &gt; ~6000 km/hr. With a ship; no need to zero out lateral velocity; so can stage at up to ~9000 km/h.
1,As mentioned before; ship landings are needed for high velocity missions. Altitude &amp; distance don't mean much for orbit. All about speed.
1,@mbhnyc steel collet
1,Well; at least the pieces were bigger this time! Won't be last RUD; but am optimistic about upcoming ship landing. https://t.co/w007TccANJ
1,@Uncle_Gus probably
1,However; that was not what prevented it being good. Touchdown speed was ok; but a leg lockout didn't latch; so it tipped over after landing.
1,Definitely harder to land on a ship. Similar to an aircraft carrier vs land: much smaller target area; that's also translating &amp; rotating.
1,Maybe some debris ingestion. Engine data looks ok. Will borescope tonight. This is one of the outer engines.
1,Conducted hold-down firing of returned Falcon rocket. Data looks good overall; but engine 9 showed thrust fluctuations.

1,@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX However; we did prove that a SuperDraco landing could work by doing a propulsive hover https://t.co/Mr7VFIQwWf
1,@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX All correct. Parachutes were originally the backup landing system; with SuperDraco thrusters as primary. Difficulty of proving thruster landing safety *and* architecture being suboptimal for moon/Mars caused us to change focus to parachutes.

1,Almost a decade ago. Original Dragon in background.
1,@PPathole @RhiddhiD Ya just can’t beat BR
1,@AVRWC Planet Claire is 🔥🔥
1,@cybrtrck Fair point! Will discuss with team.
1,@RhiddhiD He was amazing
1,Great song https://t.co/wj4YdJglSH
1,@spotted_model @cleantechnica Nickel is the biggest challenge for high-volume; long-range batteries! Australia &amp; Canada are doing pretty well. US nickel production is objectively very lame. Indonesia 🇮🇩 is great! https://t.co/0MeEE5wRfo
1,@SamTalksTesla That’s me! Haha
1,@cleantechnica This has a lot of potential. Lithium is pretty much everywhere.
1,@Teslarati Whoa cool
1,@Kristennetten @yourfavgas @ajtourville Has to be blue steel :)
1,@Mattiecola @ajtourville We need high Brinell hardness &amp; high corrosion resistance. Because of Cybertruck’s faceted nature; formability is not important.
1,@flcnhvy @yourfavgas @ajtourville I really want to do this! Will be great fun. Could be both LA and Austin.
1,@yourfavgas @ajtourville Turning them into shade for an outdoor restaurant here in Boca
1,@ajtourville Cool
1,@Ghost_TeslaPhx @28delayslater @CrewTesla @jrosinski97 @marc_benton @ray4tesla Not impossible

1,@iliketeslas @PJHORNAK @RandyVegetables I know! Congratulations to the people of Bolivia 🇧🇴!!
1,@PPathole @maureendowd The song I whistle most is Strangers in the Night
1,@RandyVegetables Some of whom seriously think Tesla toppled the Bolivian govt (sigh) https://t.co/yC5gaa12DW
1,@maureendowd Great song
1,@karaswisher @maureendowd @elon Haha thanks Kara :)
1,@erikmaza @maureendowd For sure
1,@TheFavoritist @NASASpaceflight @BocaChicaGal Yeah; we’re hunkering down here until the hurricane passes
1,@Adolfo_MorenoS @historyofarmani Exactly!
1,Cool Model 3 review by @iamjamiefoxx https://t.co/hJDD7BjkE3
1,@teslacn Tesla will add a power lift gate at no cost
1,@HansNoordsij Agreed; hydrogen fool sells make no sense
1,Pronouns suck
1,@historyofarmani Also; we get our lithium from Australia
1,@akinfermo Yeah; would have been way better just to send everyone $6k
1,I bet no one on 🌹 Twitter even *has* a guillotine! Poseurs …
1,@engineers_feed [slow drag on cigarette) Facebook? Haven’t heard that name in years …
1,🌹 Twitter sucks
1,@stevenbonchev @APompliano Something like that. If politicians could legislate wealth; everyone would be a trillionaire.
1,These are jammed to gills with special interests earmarks. If we do a stimulus at all; it should just be direct payments to consumers.
1,@PPathole Pretty much
1,Goal of government should be to maximize the happiness of the people. Giving each person money allows them to decide what meets their needs; rather than the blunt tool of legislation; which creates self-serving special interests.
1,As a reminder; I’m in *favor* of universal basic income
1,Another government stimulus package is not in the best interests of the people imo
1,@realDonaldTrump @Tesla Thank you on behalf of the Tesla team. We look forward to building Giga Texas!
1,@schristakos @PUBG Something fun is coming
1,@vincent13031925 @UniversalPics @TomCruise @SpaceX Could be great!
1,@teslaownersSV @cleantechnica That’s a great idea!
1,@Tesla We are actually looking for revolutionary actuaries for Tesla Insurance! Please inquire; if interested.
1,@cleantechnica Tbh; we are just a bit less foolish than before
1,@SciGuySpace Especially for boost stage; which is volumetrically constrained; CH4 is way better than H2. Soviet CH4 engine prototypes from 80’s were very advanced. Glad to see reusability is being factored in.
1,@waitbutwhy Basically; our pixel size
1,@LudaLisl @Tesla Can’t emphasize this enough
1,@tomosman @Tesla Absolutely
1,@ajtourville Haha
1,@cleantechnica Agreed
1,@internetofshit My oven keeps asking for my wifi password. It’s not gonna get it.

1,@LoomisP_ @MSNBC @11thHour Well said; Brian Williams!
1,@FutureJurvetson Great shot!
1,@SamTalksTesla Sometimes; that’s how I feel too!
1,@PPathole @Teslarati @BocaChicaGal Will attempt to fly later this week
1,@sri_myneni @Erdayastronaut @considercosmos @SpaceX Sound &amp; flame color will be quite different
1,@Teslarati @BocaChicaGal We’re rapidly changing alloy constituents &amp; forming methods; so traditional names like 304L will become more of an approximation
1,@cleantechnica At some point; we should probably do advertising as art/communication/entertainment &amp; to support high quality media
1,@JohnnaCrider0 @YStijd @ID_AA_Carmack It’s almost right
1,@YStijd @ID_AA_Carmack We talked about an hour ago. He seems fine.
1,@ID_AA_Carmack VR Twitter with avatars saying the mentions 😈
1,@PPathole We should bring Life to Mars
1,Both fairing halves caught from space by @SpaceX ships!
1,@SpaceX Nice work; SpaceX team!
1,@flcnhvy @AstroBehnken @Astro_Doug @SpaceX Still long way to go. Reuse only matters to degree that it’s rapid &amp; complete.

1,@Teslarati Important to service very high latitudes
1,@Confiant_man American; but born in South Africa. Left by myself when I was 17.
1,@businessinsider True; the 2012 Model S is still a great car. Was driving SN28 a few months ago and driving feel was excellent. Model S remains my fav car to drive.
1,@teslaownersSV @stephenpallotta Will discuss on Wed earnings call. Lots to talk about!
1,@hiromichimizuno This looks cool
1,@PPathole It has that potential
1,@maxxrpbtc @TheCryptoLark @Manny6Manny @jungleincxrp @digitalassetbuy @MoonLamboio @JWilliamsFstmed Good article. I started The Boring Company as a joke; but now it’s digging real tunnels!
1,@teslaownersSV @waitbutwhy It’s not really set up for tours; but maybe it should
1,@AstroBehnken @SpaceX @NASA @Space_Station Manufactured only 5 mins from LAX!
1,@waitbutwhy Some contribute more. Y chromosome &amp; mitochondria are constant; except for mutations.
1,@Kristennetten That is just one part of the surgery. For this to scale; it must be fully automated; like LASIK.
1,This would solve a lot of brain/spine injuries &amp; is ultimately essential for AI symbiosis
1,@fermatslibrary Fermi was awesome. He understood the right questions to ask.
1,@m4ttwegner @flcnhvy How come Hulk never loses pants!?
1,Solving high-volume; high-reliability; low-cost production problems is especially valued

1,Thanks
1,Just stop
1,@LewisMartin_ @engineers_feed Gigafactory is the product even more than the car
1,@engineers_feed Carefully hidden
1,@teslaownersSV @Kristennetten Sure
1,@Kristennetten Might be an indoor/outdoor rave space on the roof
1,@Pontolemaeus @SilverDeGeneral @BBCScienceNews Exactly; this is a serious problem. Ratio of retirees to workers is tracking towards unsustainability in many countries. An upside down demographic pyramid is unstable.
1,@vincentdiong @GerberKawasaki Considering
1,@flcnhvy @SpaceX Small note: latch on post near base is gone &amp; powered Ethernet wire is less obtrusive in production version
1,@PPathole @BBCScienceNews This thing we call “money” is just a (slow; lossy &amp; unsecure) database for labor allocation. Investing is meaningless without people; at least until AGI happens; which will obviate need for labor &amp; necessitate UBI.
1,@nnalinas @BBCScienceNews Trying to set a good example haha. Mars needs people!
1,@GerberKawasaki Great work by Tesla software engineering
1,@BBCScienceNews Population collapse is 2nd biggest danger to civilization after AI imo
1,@Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @SpaceX Yeah; will take less than a minute to order on https://t.co/Q1VvqVmJ2i when it goes live
1,@flcnhvy @SpaceX Starlink terminal has motors to self-orient for optimal view angle. No expert installer required. Just plug in &amp; give it a clear view of the sky. Can be in garden; on roof; table; pretty much anywhere; so long as it has a wide view of the sky.
1,@Erdayastronaut @thesheetztweetz @BryceSpaceTech @SpaceX @ulalaunch @torybruno @MHI_Group @roscosmos @Peter_J_Beck To revolutionize space; the right metric is mass to orbit or you could translate that to # of useful satellites brought to orbit. No substitute for mass though. Scale don’t lie.
1,@TeslaAircraft @flcnhvy @Tesla Exactly
1,@WholeMarsBlog Tesla Autopilot was literally named after the term used in aviation. Also; what about Autobahn!?
1,@teslaownersSV @engineers_feed The strength &amp; perseverance of the people of Tesla; despite facing extreme difficulties
1,@engineers_feed Playable on any Tesla!
1,@EfficiencyLast @jaminwestby @teslaownersSV @jgrano305 @TeslaratiTeam @Teslarati Should do this automatically
1,@katlinegrey Reusability is essential. A rocket that is single use is just as absurd as a single use airplane. F9 engines already fire 3 times per flight.
1,@vincent13031925 Wild times!
1,@SpaceflightNow We’re being extra paranoid. Maximizing probability of successful launch is paramount.
1,@summergamefest Welcome anytime
1,@bradyleonard Well; I do care very much about sustainability of civilization; but there is some truth to the irony part haha
1,@TeslaTn @jgrano305 @TeslaratiTeam @Teslarati @DollyParton Yes; in plan. Superchargers and public high power wall connectors will keep growing exponentially every year.
1,@jaminwestby @teslaownersSV @jgrano305 @TeslaratiTeam @Teslarati I think so
1,@jgrano305 @TeslaratiTeam @Teslarati Doing range testing now. Number will be significantly higher than 300. Extremely good for any EV; especially an SUV.
1,@jgrano305 @TeslaratiTeam @Teslarati We have reduced pricing on Model Y LR dual motor &amp; will offer a LR single motor Y in a few months; which improves affordability; while still keeping the product excellent
1,@vicentes @TeslaratiTeam @Teslarati It may be able to reach 250kW at low states of charge
1,@jgrano305 @TeslaratiTeam @Teslarati No; as range would be unacceptably low (&lt; 250 mile EPA)
1,@TeslaratiTeam @Teslarati We had to increase some wire thicknesses in S/X to reduce resistive heating. Technically; won’t be quite 1000 mph charging; as X especially is much bigger than 3.
1,@MightyTesla @SamTalksTesla @ElonsWorld @Nikola_Truth @WholeMarsBlog @RenataKonkoly @stevenmarkryan @vincent13031925 @HyperChangeTV @TeslaPodcast Hell of a ride!

1,@Ali_Afshari In general; we need to improve how podcasts play
1,@djzinc @kenyanwalstreet True haha
1,@RationalEtienne @flcnhvy @PPathole @IheartTesla Death is the loss of information
1,@thatt3slaguy @flcnhvy @PPathole @IheartTesla Earning power post augmentation would easily pay for itself (if that’s even necessary). This is the best thing I can think of to ensure that collective human will decides the future.
1,@flcnhvy @PPathole @IheartTesla Absolutely
1,@mjkapkan @EvaFoxU @Tesla Probably a good one to design &amp; engineer in Germany
1,@blue_bnd @EvaFoxU @Tesla Even more
1,@EvaFoxU @Tesla Berlin Model Y is the one to watch. That is a revolution in automotive body engineering (finally).
1,Wow; IHOP &amp; GitHub are close
1,Best use of the term “Full Stack”?
1,@PPathole @IheartTesla For sure. This is both great &amp; terrifying. Everything we’ve ever sensed or thought has been electrical signals. The early universe was just a soup of quarks &amp; leptons. How did a very small piece of the Universe start to think of itself as sentient?
1,@buzzindelhi Sorry; should hopefully be soon!
1,@kenyanwalstreet Not actually a payout; just a vesting of stock options. It may never pay out; as the stock can’t be sold for 5 years after exercise. The stock must be bought &amp; income taxes paid; then hold value for 5 years.
1,@IheartTesla No easy way to answer this in a tweet; but helping with dire brain injuries is our first priority. Details Aug 28.
1,AI symbiosis while u wait
1,@vistacruiser7 @flcnhvy There’s some of that too
1,@flcnhvy True; it sounds so surreal; but the negative propaganda is still all out there &amp; easy to find in social media &amp; press interviews; so it’s not just our imagination!
1,@PPathole Make sure to read ur terms &amp; conditions before clicking accept!
1,@PPathole Altho Dumb and Dumber is 🔥🔥
1,Progress update August 28
1,@AusTeslaOwners Sure
1,If you can’t beat em; join em Neuralink mission statement
1,@vincent13031925 @teslacn @EvaFoxU Tesla China team is awesome!
1,@lexfridman Words are a very lossy compression of thought
1,@nicebit_net @valleyhack If you get past Mars; the asteroids; moons of Jupiter &amp; Saturn; inevitably you reach Uranus!
1,@cnunezimages 🖤✨Carl Sagan ✨🖤
1,@valleyhack Essentially. Long-term purpose of my Tesla stock is to help make life multiplanetary to ensure it’s continuance. The massive capital needs are in 10 to 20 years. By then; if we’re fortunate; Tesla’s goal of accelerating sustainable energy &amp; autonomy will be mostly accomplished.
1,@BBCScienceNews Thank goodness for modern medicine!
1,@JohnnaCrider0 For sure
1,@Teslarati Coming soon; our battle with Big Tequila! It’s real.
1,@ajtourville @TeslaratiApp @Teslarati That would be next-level 🤣🤣

1,@blue_bnd @Kristennetten @flcnhvy @PPathole Yeah; it’s pretty weird
1,@spaceguy_24 @teslaownersSV @EvaFoxU @cnunezimages @Tesla Yeah; but first we need to finish Giga Berlin and a second US Giga to serve eastern half of North America
1,@EvaFoxU @cnunezimages Nice haha
1,@CyberpunkGame @kanyewest It may have started already
1,@cnunezimages It’s absurdly large
1,Beautiful fireworks in LA tonight

1,@kanyewest You have my full support!
1,Please take a moment to report accounts clearly engaged in harassment. It is the only way to maintain public discourse.
1,🇺🇸🇺🇸 Happy 4th of July!! 🇺🇸🇺🇸
1,@PPathole @cybrtrkguy @flcnhvy That would be great
1,@xiang_aw @bigwheelastro @ChainsawMelee @EvaFoxU @PPathole @leighalexander @TalulahRiley Agreed; but it’s hard to ignore what is effectively a social media denial of service attack
1,@cybrtrkguy @flcnhvy Accounts that unequivocally advocate harassment should be suspended with warning; then shut down if repeated
1,@flcnhvy True
1,@bigwheelastro @ChainsawMelee @EvaFoxU @PPathole @leighalexander @TalulahRiley Yeah; but why? I’m working on sustainable energy cars &amp; solar that help Earth and making life multiplanetary; to ensure its continuance; with SpaceX.
1,@EvaFoxU @PPathole @leighalexander @TalulahRiley Thanks; that would promote good public discourse
1,@PPathole @leighalexander @TalulahRiley A pseudojourno asked all his followers to spam my mentions
1,@Martx1995 @leighalexander True
1,@leighalexander You’re a good person
1,@leighalexander @SpaceX To the best our knowledge; he never toured SpaceX. Don’t know where that comes from.
1,@leighalexander I was at that Vanity Fair party with @TalulahRiley. Don’t know Ghislaine. Real question is why did VF invite her?
1,@kenklippenstein Now you’re unblocked; so stop whining
1,@kenklippenstein I only block people as a direct insult https://t.co/KWW9GCvQGb
1,@PPathole @SamTalksTesla Yes. Green card (permanent residency) is fine too for SpaceX; according to ITAR rules.
1,@HassanAesthetic Yeah; Tesla app would enable you to release your car into the fleet &amp; summon it back at will
1,@SamTalksTesla Directly; my companies employ roughly 65;000 people. However; there is a massive global supply &amp; logistics chain that employs 4 to 5 times that number.

1,@GovStitt @Tesla @BearAgencyGroup @signal_factory Thanks for hosting me in Tulsa today!
1,@ReadCoal @Supernautical @flcnhvy @RationalEtienne @chrish7985 @rlyrlysryDave This is false. I landed in Montreal at age 17 with $2000; a backpack of clothes &amp; suitcase of books. My father is bankrupt &amp; has been for a long time. I inherited literally nothing from him. https://t.co/M63NjiKkw2
1,@JustinAHorwitz She photobombed me at a Vanity Fair Oscar party. Was there with @TalulahRiley. Don’t know Ghislaine at all. Why do you think it should be a bigger story?
1,@WholeMarsBlog @tesla_truth Greenspan is crackers; bananas; barky &amp; ten cards short of a full deck

1,@EverydayElon @TeslaTested @teslaownersSV @kimbal HCL appears to be effective when used early https://t.co/d27STax48L
1,@Lockl34r @Tesla Unfortunately; there are thousands of automotive design rule differences between US &amp; EU; including completely different charge ports. Gets worse every year. Not our choice.
1,@TeslaTested @teslaownersSV @kimbal There’s that too. Deaths should be broken out as died with vs died of.
1,@teslaownersSV @kimbal Deaths continue to trend down https://t.co/FsZNwkvs1H
1,@kimbal We’re seeing field false positives much higher than lab false positives; in range of 5% to 10%. Article says testing went from 100k to 600k; which means a 6-fold increase in false positives. My guess is most cases; especially “no symptoms”; are false positives.
1,@flcnhvy @RationalEtienne @chrish7985 @rlyrlysryDave The news is sometimes created; but always curated. The latter is most pernicious. On any given day; there are thousands of potential stories. By picking which stories are written about &amp; how prominently they’re placed; a handful of publishers control much of the public narrative.
1,@flcnhvy @RationalEtienne @chrish7985 @rlyrlysryDave Klippenstein has gone full twitter troll. Big mistake. Never go full troll!
1,@RationalEtienne @chrish7985 @rlyrlysryDave Oh yeah; Klip Einstein; pseudojournalist &amp; douche-about-town

1,@hot_rod_co Something’s messed up about medicine that’s anti-science. In science; you question everyone; no matter who they are. Facts &amp; reasoning are everything; but in medicine too much emphasis is on credentials; often by people who’ve accomplished nothing but a PhD thesis used by no one.

1,@SamTalksTesla @tlowdon @daniellevitt22 Tesla; as a side project; is building RNA microfactories for CureVac &amp; possibly others
1,@SamTalksTesla @tlowdon @daniellevitt22 In principle; I think synthetic RNA (and DNA) has amazing potential. This basically makes the solution to many diseases a software problem.
1,@tlowdon @daniellevitt22 As you’d expect; this has resulted in a proportionately very high number of C19 false positives. Field test reliability we are seeing is best case 5%; worst case 50% false positive. Much worse than lab accuracy.
1,@EthicalSkeptic Seems fishy
1,@Louisbotelho17 @romanhistory1 @HardcoreHistory 🤣🤣 very true
1,@TeslaOwnersEBay @WholeMarsBlog @romanhistory1 @HardcoreHistory A lot of functionality will happen all at once when we transition to the new software stack. Most likely; it will be releasable in 2 to 4 months. Then it’s a question of what functionality is proven safe enough to enable for owners.
1,@WholeMarsBlog @romanhistory1 @HardcoreHistory Going well. Team is kicking ass &amp; it’s an honor to work with them. Pretty much everything had to be rewritten; including our labeling software; so that it’s fundamentally “3D” at every step from training through inference.

1,@justin_hart @BrittMayJasper This bill needs to be revoked. It gives absurd power to county bureaucrats.
1,@CosmicNinjaGoat @WhatsupFranks @kimbal If accurate; this would explain a lot
1,@WhatsupFranks @kimbal Levitt is right
1,@kimbal There are a lot of C19 false positives messing up the numbers. Even tests with 5% false positive rate (in *field*; not lab) would show up as ~17 million  fake C19 cases even if there were actually none.
1,@BerniceKing @jack @MichaelDTubbs @AndrewYang Very much agree
1,@28delayslater @geekwire Good hygiene always makes sense
1,@ChrisDungeon True
1,@Garrett_Watts @_TomCross_ @Tesla @Petersen_Museum Cybertruck does feel like cgi irl
1,@geekwire There are a ridiculous number of false positive C19 tests; in some cases ~50%. False positives scale linearly with # of tests. This is a big part of why C19 positive tests are going up while hospitalizations &amp; mortality are declining. Anyone who tests positive should retest.
1,Btw; Tesla actually receives *least* subsidies of any automaker in US. Federal tax credit applies to other automaker EVs; but no longer Tesla.

1,@lulusdave @Tesla Glad you’re ok
1,@flcnhvy @Ford Exactly! A carbon tax is needed to correct the unpriced externality &amp; market will do the rest. The consequences of slow action are serious. In my opinion; we need to convert &gt;80% of the global road; sea &amp; air fleet to renewables by 2050.

1,@TslaCybertruck @jgrano305 @uhaveanygrapes @Flash_Titans There will be a subscription; but it will be economically better to have bought FSD
1,@jgrano305 @uhaveanygrapes @Flash_Titans This would be a good time to upgrade to FSD; as it goes up by $1k on July 1. We could make it $7k to upgrade to FSD until July 1 (even if you don’t have basic Autopilot). Does that sound good?
1,@uhaveanygrapes @Flash_Titans This does sound excessive. Will look into it.
1,@Flash_Titans Just us being fools; but free Supercharging forever is not coming back to any vehicles. It’s not a good incentive structure.
1,@TheGledinator @teslaownersSV @mattie_rogers @aikatchu @Tesla Haha Teslas all the way down
1,@teslaownersSV @mattie_rogers @aikatchu @Tesla Maybe; will look into it. We’d need to emulate a TV.
1,@mattie_rogers @aikatchu @Tesla We could probably make a fun punch (click) buggy game; with extra points for rare Teslas
1,@MKBHD Bought based on your review. It’s great!
1,@cleantechnica The was not to outcompete other companies; but rather to maximize usefulness &amp; rate of progress in the absolute
1,@cleantechnica For example; we created a chip design team from scratch for the Tesla full self-driving computer; which is not something car companies do
1,@cleantechnica Tesla should really be thought of as roughly a dozen technology startups; many of which have little to no correlation with traditional automotive companies
1,@vincent13031925 @teslacn We are putting a lot of effort into improving the Tesla China experience with local engineering &amp; great feedback from Tesla owners in China!

1,@CoreyBa95130768 @NASASpaceflight @Erdayastronaut It will look a little odd
1,@flcnhvy @teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @cleantechnica Probably Fremont
1,@teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @cleantechnica Probably good to combine them; since they are converging in time. I’m hopeful we can announce a date after the July 4th week.
1,@Kristennetten @cleantechnica Yes; but we will have to postpone annual shareholder meeting; as still no large gatherings allowed by July 7th. Not sure of new date; but am guessing maybe a month or so later.
1,@cleantechnica Stop by The Petersen is you’d like to see Cybertruck irl! Lots of awesome cars &amp; bikes there. Definitely worth seeing with or without Cybertruck.

1,@NYYScoreKeep Not sure. They’re pretty close together.
1,@westcoastbill It will be real
1,@cisoml @Erdayastronaut @russ_parrish Maybe Incat https://t.co/qHbJcMocFg
1,@flcnhvy There will be many test flights before commercial passengers are carried. First Earth to Earth test flights might be in 2 or 3 years.
1,@Erdayastronaut @russ_parrish We need to be far enough away so as not to bother heavily populated areas. The launch &amp; landing are not subtle. But you could get within a few miles of the spaceport in a boat.

1,@VitalVegas Looking likely
1,@Mad_Maelstrom @Peter_J_Beck @torybruno @Starlinksat223 @Erdayastronaut Throttling is done by adjusting flow to the ox and fuel preburners. The lower limit of thrust is ox &amp; fuel turbopump injector preburner “stiffness”; essentially when do the preburner elements start flaming out.
1,@SciGuySpace Tank didn’t burst; but leaked at 7.6 bar. This is a good result &amp; supports idea of 304L stainless being better than 301. We’re developing our own alloy to take this even further. Leak before burst is highly desirable.
1,@Peter_J_Beck @torybruno @Starlinksat223 @Erdayastronaut Yeah. Merlin; using a single pintle injector with cold; liquid propellant; needs a longer chamber than Raptor; which uses a large number of coaxial injectors; despite Merlin being less than half thrust. Propellant enters Raptor chamber as hot gas that’s already mixed.
1,@SciGuySpace That’s the goal. There a few known weak points on this test tank; probably capable of more pressure. The second test tank to follow shortly has addressed the weak points.
1,@skysira @joshcohen @tokren1 @Andrew81947993 @FatEmperor @MarkChangizi @gordon_dyce @dvdclstn @Not_Far_Enough @DaphnaRedliner @MLevitt_NP2013 Accurate

1,@justpaulinelol @engineers_feed As foretold by https://t.co/LJJCD7BAgX
1,@engineers_feed Stonks
1,@Erdayastronaut @i_gvf @SciGuySpace Exactly. Chartering a dedicated 747 flight around the world costs less than buying a small; single engine turboprop plane. In the same way; a giant reusable rocket flight is way cheaper than a tiny expendable rocket that can be used only once.
1,@tobyliiiiiiiiii @physorg_com @nature @SciReports True
1,@olenamuliarchuk @mrkylefield @cleantechnica Battery industry is world champion at bs. “Lithium-ion” doesn’t really mean anything. What matters is cathode &amp; anode material. There are many choices; but nickel cathode with carbon-silicon anode works great.

1,@thesheetztweetz @SpaceX @Commercial_Crew @AstroBehnken @Astro_Doug @ingallsimages @NASAKennedy ❤️ the laser beam long exposure shots
1,@nickwijngaards @Erdayastronaut @SciGuySpace Hundreds of improvements in manufacturability primarily (this is by far the hardest problem); mass down; thrust up; Isp up. Current improvement list continues past SN50. As the saying goes; it’s 1% inspiration &amp; 99% perspiration …
1,@John_Gardi @SciGuySpace Also; insulation of a deep cryogen( which I’d call anything that liquifies nitrogen aka 78% of air) is heavy &amp; prone to heat leaks. H2 is hell.
1,Tesla factory workplace safety is 5% better than industry average for manufacturers &amp; improving fast https://t.co/axmInA9fZb
1,@Erdayastronaut @SciGuySpace Important technical note: due to higher O/F of CH4 vs RP1 (oxygen is dense) &amp; significant density increase of subcooled CH4 (plus no common dome insulation needed); plus cryo strength bump of CH4; tank mass of CH4/O2 stage is almost same as RP1/O2.

1,Posting Tesla Impact Report; this time with summary points &amp; charts in my reply tweets https://t.co/4lyaV7kIS4
1,@venus47203379 @engineers_feed Haha. Will post summary.
1,@SciGuySpace Combined with SpaceX deep subcooling of propellants to near liquefaction temp of N2; use of common dome (CH4 &amp; O2 liquid at similar temps) &amp; higher T/W of engines enables de facto higher delta-V than an H2/O2 stage
1,@SciGuySpace Quite a piece! I should credit Soviet/Russian engine work in the 80’s as being a factor in deciding to switch from H2 to CH4. They demonstrated excellent performance on test stands; with Isp up to 380 secs.

1,@chriswarriner @flcnhvy Bad incentive structure
1,@flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut We’re working on new legs. Wider stance &amp; able to auto-level. Important for leaning into wind or landing on rocky &amp; pitted surfaces.
1,@Erdayastronaut Forward thrusters are to stabilize ship when landing in high winds. If goal is max payload to moon per ship; no heatshield or flaps or big gas thruster packs are needed. No need to bring early ships back. They can serve as part of moon base alpha.
1,@Erdayastronaut Absolutely
1,@JimBridenstine @Commercial_Crew @NASA Outcome-based contracting with multiple competitors is vastly better than cost-plus (especially if sole-sourced); as the former rewards results &amp; latter rewards waste. Outcome contracting should be applied broadly within government. The difference in results will be incredible.
1,Wow; this is extremely important!!
1,@PPathole @Tesla Autopilot prime directive is: don’t crash. What seems fast to humans is slow to a computer. 360 degree low light vision &amp; sonar; plus forward radar enable to be superhuman. Upcoming software upgrades will increasingly show the potential.

1,@CollinRugg Wow; which law firm?
1,@WallStreetSilv Does seem strange that there is no effort to unmask or otherwise identify everyone in the group
1,@MattWalshBlog @publius_5 It’s not porn; which has been readily available from the days of VHS tapes; but rather the general temptation of the online world; if you’re going to blame it on anything electronic.  Sex is not what matters. Lots of people are having sex that have no kids.   Population implosion
1,@Austen Yeah
1,@hodgetwins I have seen no evidence of aliens. If I did; I would 💯 post about it on 𝕏 instantly!  SpaceX has almost 6000 satellites in orbit and not once have we had to maneuver around aliens. 👽
1,@JTLonsdale Yeah!
1,@MattWalshShow Hoaxception
1,@ChayaRaichik10 That would be so perfect
1,Dustin; wd u lik sum t? https://t.co/8m95snbLuJ
1,@stillgray Euphemism treadmill never stops
1,@ChayaRaichik10 Cool
1,Try out Tesla supervised full self-driving and you’ll be amazed!
1,@WesternLensman @robbystarbuck They have empathy for the criminals; but not for the victims
1,@TevTevTevin @WholeMarsBlog Sorry; I was laughing too hard to read the screen properly 🤣🤣
1,@DavidSHolz “They’re Made of Meat” is hilarious
1,@WholeMarsBlog I’d like to apologize to Dustin Moskowitz for calling him a “retard”. That was wrong.  What I meant to say is that he is a pompous idiot whose his head is so far up his own ass that he is legally blind.  I wish him the best and hope that someday we can be friends.
1,@EdKrassen AGI will come first; but there are many levels of AGI.  As @waitbutwhy’s charts suggest; we are at the very beginning of intelligence.  Humans are the biological bootloader for digital superintelligence and we may serve as a backup plan for intelligence; given that humans are far
1,@AdrianDittmann Yeah; Dustin is the one who should go to jail for impersonating a smart person
1,@WholeMarsBlog What a retard
1,@dogeofficialceo Same
1,@EdKrassen The point of creator payouts is to incentivize high quality content on 𝕏.  In some cases; we are seeing the opposite; where people are spamming the system to generate ad money. That is obviously not ok.
1,@EvaFoxU Yeah
1,@KonstantinKisin Absolutely
1,@tomselliott @JakeSullivan46 What does victory look like?
1,What more do we need to do to improve Communities?
1,@Jason @grok Good point. Grok autorespond bot incoming.
1,@shaunmmaguire Sigh
1,@xDaily Ad revenue sharing will be paused for some creators pending investigation into use of bots to spam likes; replies; DMs; etc
1,@WallStreetSilv 😂  Technically; that is true; but it won’t move the needle much.  The long-term problem is shifting trillions of tons of carbon from deep underground to the atmosphere.   That will eventually have an effect that will be extremely difficult to reverse.
1,@cb_doge @andst7 We need to preserve and make accessible as much knowledge as possible.   So much has been lost over the past 5000 years.
1,@Rothmus Yes; inflation causes prices to rise; but not value; so it amplifies the capital gains tax.  This applies to everyone who owns a house. Even if your house value is the same when adjusted for inflation; you will still pay a capital gains tax even when there is not a true gain.
1,Great interview with @johanknorberg!
1,@Erdayastronaut A booster catch attempt is highly likely this year.  For the ship; we need to be sure that it will survive reentry and retain aero control authority; so that means at least 2 successes landing at a precise point in the ocean.
1,@disclosetv Really? Is there a legal investigation?
1,@WholeMarsBlog We believe version 12 is ready for supervised FSD in LHD countries. RHD will take a bit longer.
1,@cb_doge It will become obvious over time that you can do anything on 𝕏; so features like this will be taken for granted
1,@imPenny2x @SciGuySpace The critical Fermi “great filter” threshold is Mars being able to survive and grow if the resupply ships from Earth stop coming for any reason.  At that point; we will be a true multiplanet civilization.
1,@nima_owji Cool
1,@SmokeAwayyy Maybe Mayorkas is grumpy about the fact that I think he should be impeached for ushering in vast numbers of illegals by any means possible; while simultaneously making legal immigration almost impossible 🤷‍♂️
1,@EndWokeness It’s crazy
1,@SciGuySpace It’s just docking with ourselves. Not trivial; but certainly easier than docking with the Space Station; which is far more complex.
1,@PeterDiamandis It’s a big deal
1,@SciGuySpace Full &amp; rapid reusability of booster &amp; ship and orbital refilling of ship are the 2 fundamental technologies we aim to solve by the end of next year.  Those are the critical pieces necessary to make life multiplanetary.
1,@cb_doge Yeah
1,@DavidSHolz A few other suggestions off-the-cuff:  Foundation series  Moon is a Harsh Mistress and the first 2/3 of Stranger in a Strange Land  Starhammer (partly inspired Halo)  Stainless Steel Rat
1,@engineers_feed There are actually a lot of ways to interpret the word “cathode”; but; for those who make batteries/cells; it is the side with metal and the anode is the side with carbon and/or silicon
1,@DavidSHolz Good list
1,Best illustration I’ve seen
1,@WallStreetSilv The fazebook logo that jumps all over the video is super annoying
1,@Teslaconomics Cool
1,@stevenmarkryan It’s not an obvious move
1,Babe; tell me the truth … https://t.co/kkW3GXNBVl
1,@zachweinberg Yeah
1,@BrianRoemmele Needs an “eat me” sign
1,@alx Burglary in San Francisco and Oakland is limited only by how many hours thieves are willing to work. Literally!
1,@lexfridman I’ve heard that Ayahuasca can lead to deep personal insights
1,@adampnathan Indeed (sigh)
1,@WallStreetSilv Yeah
1,@niccruzpatane @Tesla @WholeMarsBlog @SawyerMerritt Cool
1,Most of history had and still most of the world has “might makes right” as the axiomatic error.   If any thought is given to it; you should obviously consider morality in the absolute! Deeds done determine good or bad; not whether one party is stronger or weaker than the other.
1,The axiomatic error undermining much of Western Civilization is “weak makes right”.   If someone accepts; explicitly or implicitly; that the oppressed are always the good guys; then the natural conclusion is that the strong are the bad guys.
1,@Snowden 😂 have to give them props for comedy
1,@WholeMarsBlog Vast majority of people have no idea this works
1,@WholeMarsBlog Fixed in 12.4.   The 12.3.x releases are very minor changes.
1,@eyeslasho You’re welcome.   Free speech is only real if people you don’t like can say things you don’t like.
1,@Jim_Jordan Absolutely true. The legacy media is a Biden/Democrat cheering squad.   There is a massive double-standard.
1,@Jim_Jordan There needs to be a bipartisan commission to review judicial and prosecutorial misconduct nationwide.   Public faith in the judicial system must be restored!
1,@Kristennetten Yeah
1,@WallStreetSilv That was so weird. Where exactly did they take all the mentally ill drug addicts? There are normally several thousand on the streets of San Francisco.  The streets were suddenly and immediately cleaned up. Never seen that before.
1,Absolutely true!  “The evidence is overwhelming that the majority of people on the street are there because of untreated mental illness or addiction; which leads people to use all their money to support their drug habit and be high; rather than work.”
1,@_Drew_2_U It may technically be on the books; as many other laws are that are not enforced; but ask anyone in SF if the police will actually show up if you’re threatened by someone on the street; but were not physically harmed (because you outran them).
1,@DogRightGirl Not an uncommon sentiment
1,@cb_doge Very common occurrence
1,Late last year; several 𝕏 employees were threatened by a guy with a machete outside the Walgreens on Market St in SF.   They didn’t report it; because that doesn’t constitute an arrestable crime in California.   That guy later killed 3 people.
1,@WallStreetSilv Quite a story
1,People want the truth
1,@stclairashley Indeed
1,@unlimited_ls Three prior felony convictions. For how much time was he incarcerated?  Makes no sense to release someone with extremely violent recidivism. Empathy for him; but cruelty to his future victims; is actually negative true empathy.
1,@Austen Yeah
1,@DefiantLs The degree to which people directly contradict themselves is remarkable!
1,While many other countries are worse; America is trending towards extinction!
1,@growing_daniel Cell phone and laptop batteries use cobalt; but most electric cars use none.   Those that do use cobalt; use very little; as the cathode is primarily nickel; which performs better and costs less than cobalt.
1,@Rob_2628 Cool; I hope it’s good
1,@cb_doge @HBO Yeah
1,@RichardHanania Their audience will continue to decline
1,Starlink now available in Micronesia!
1,@KeaganGigatexas Cool
1,@WallStreetSilv This administration will not describe what victory looks like; because there is no overlap between what is politically acceptable to say and what is actually possible to achieve.
1,@MarioNawfal I would be happy to testify
1,@adampnathan Whoa
1,Concerning
1,@sfstandard Hope she’s ok
1,@michaeljknowles Accurate thread

1,@SciGuySpace Amazing amount of useful work by the SpaceX team
1,@krassenstein Exactly
1,@AlexBerenson @realDonaldTrump Yeah

1,@Teslaconomics No choice
1,This graph illustrates the woke mind virus taking over legacy media.   Same happened with online media and the education system. Then it spread to other countries.   Infection rate almost 100%.  But now it will die. https://t.co/z5wMNfRym2
1,@SawyerMerritt Humans have trouble internalizing responsibility
1,@natfriedman 😂 everyone and their cat thinks this
1,@cb_doge Does seem unfair
1,@PeterDiamandis I mean … you’re probably right; but dang things are moving fast already!

1,@AIDRIVR 12.4 is a major improvement and 12.5 is a whole other level
1,You are right!
1,@stclairashley Now is vastly better than the past!
1,@RepJeffries Why is it race-based; rather than income-based?   The former is by definition racist.
1,@Rainmaker1973 Mosquitoes are evil
1,@Rothmus Games from Japan are still good; because they don’t ruin the art with woke DEI lies
1,@jk_rowling @suzanne_moore Yeah
1,Tesla has now created over 30;000 manufacturing jobs in California!
1,@niccruzpatane Yeah
1,@Rothmus Absolutely. She is an enemy of the people of Australia.
1,@niccruzpatane @Tesla @WholeMarsBlog @tesla_na Yeah
1,@alex_avoigt Yeah
1,@unusual_whales And weapons are mid
1,Yikes
1,@Rothmus Yeah
1,@cb_doge Yeah
1,@WholeMarsBlog To add to the confusion; the IRA credit *does* apply to a leased Model 3 long range; which is why the lease price is lower than a Model 3 Performance
1,@Louisbotelho17 @WholeMarsBlog The landscape has evolved much faster than it is possible to change a massive supply chain and production system
1,@cb_doge Whoa!
1,Yeah
1,@charliekirk11 𝕏 is the only one standing up for the rights of Australians
1,Model 3 is quicker than a Porsche 911
1,The Australian people want the truth.  𝕏 is the only one standing up for their rights.

1,@LastCallCNBC @TashaARK Accurate

1,@Teslaconomics Cybertruck might be needed for a robotaxi in San Francisco 😂
1,@teslaownersSV @boringcompany It really is
1,@katyperry Looks good
1,@cb_doge Well; no president; prime minister or judge has authority over all of Earth!  This platform adheres to the laws of countries in those countries; but it would be improper to extend one country’s rulings to other countries.  If he want to censor things in other countries; he should
1,@alx At risk of being repetitive; we HAVE actually blocked the content in question for Australian IP addresses; pending legal appeal; and it only exists on servers in the USA.   By the way; there’s a great podcast about the guy after whom Tasmania is named: https://t.co/VSnQjaDreZ
1,@ScooterCasterNY @yyeeaahhhboiii2 Wow; this is wild
1,@EndWokeness I did; but now I feel weird about it
1,@cb_doge I do not think I’m above the law.   Does the PM think he should have jurisdiction over all of Earth?
1,That is exactly the issue.   Should the eSafety Commissar (an unelected official) in Australia have authority over all countries on Earth?
1,Major milestone
1,The notification tab is currently in chronological order only.   We’re working on a ranking option there; like For you vs Following.
1,@Rothmus Biggest ponzi scheme ever.   Maybe AI and robots will save it though.
1,@alx Sometimes it takes a while for the NPCs to download a software update lol
1,@cb_doge Quite the change
1,@cb_doge Absolutely
1,@teslaownersSV Yeah; wouldn’t be believable if it were fiction.   A giant rocket that is the heaviest flying object ever made and it’s on a beach down by the river 😂
1,Tesla is the lowest cost car to maintain https://t.co/VJjggL4l1E
1,Cool
1,@MarioNawfal Wow; this is next-level!
1,Our concern is that if ANY country is allowed to censor content for ALL countries; which is what the Australian “eSafety Commissar” is demanding; then what is to stop any country from controlling the entire Internet?  We have already censored the content in question for
1,@AlboMP Just want to understand clearly:   Are you requiring this platform to censor content globally; even when that content is made inaccessible to Australian IP addresses and the content is stored only on servers in the United States?
1,@MatJovanovic Algorithm improvements coming soon
1,@goth600 SpaceX literally shoots rockets past the sky every couple days
1,@bennyjohnson So where does the money go?
1,@Rainmaker1973 Lasers can do anything
1,@Not_the_Bee Good
1,@WhatsupFranks @niccruzpatane @Tesla Nice
1,@gfodor Might happen
1,@WatcherGuru This will happen more and more
1,@charity_trades @jamesdouma James is largely correct. We know roughly what the car will do in 3 to 6 months.   When a more advanced AI model is trained; it will have several breakthroughs; but also dozens of bugs where it performs much worse.   Takes a few months to fix those bugs and complete safety tests.
1,Don’t take my word for it; just ask the Australian PM! https://t.co/ZJBKrstStQ
1,@ylecun Wars will become almost entirely drone v drone
1,@nypost Interesting
1,@niccruzpatane @Tesla Exactly. The ads were far too generic – could’ve been any car.
1,@alex_avoigt Maybe
1,@eyeslasho Sounds like he has rediscovered why we need police!
1,I’d like to take a moment to thank the PM for informing the public that this platform is the only truthful one
1,@MarioNawfal It is absurd for any one country to attempt to censor the entire world
1,@BillyM2k Poor bot
1,@MAstronomers @AJamesMcCarthy Toasty
1,@mysteriouskat I have seen no evidence for aliens and; with ~6000 satellites orbiting Earth; I think I would know
1,@KonstantinKisin This is not a question of being “over Tucker” or not. I don’t agree with his views here; but he does make good points at times.  If we excluded people because they held some irrational (in my view) beliefs; there would be almost no one left.
1,@cb_doge Yeah
1,@BillyM2k Sigh. Will review with team.
1,@JordanSchachtel And far fewer Japanese people died from the atomic bombs than would have died in an invasion
1,@AIDRIVR @grok Coming
1,@alex_avoigt Exactly
1,@weRessential @PhysInHistory So easy to make nuclear bombs with modern materials and other technologies. Am surprised anyone has trouble doing it.
1,@Kristennetten Suicidal empathy
1,@WallStreetSilv Yeah
1,Time to make crime illegal again
1,@PhysInHistory Major breakthrough. They used logarithms and slide rules to design the Saturn V moon rocket.
1,@Rothmus Yeah
1,@fentasyl True
1,@GadSaad Yeah
1,@XWorldView Incredible; even today
1,@alx Common experience
1,@Rothmus The child miner thing is false.   Giant mining equipment; which is required for moving millions of tons of ore; is extremely expensive.   It is not mined by kids with spoons.
1,@waitbutwhy Yeah
1,@Rothmus Now say why
1,Robbery in most of America is out of control
1,@MarioNawfal Conservation of energy for the win yet again
1,@newstart_2024 True
1,@zerohedge Home garbage recycling is pointless. If it mattered; they could just sort the garbage at the dump.  Recycling of lithium-ion batteries; however; is economically sensible; as a dead battery is essentially super high grade ore.
1,@GadSaad True
1,@UpdatingOnRome Livy a little
1,@BillAckman @Columbia Good question
1,@eyeslasho Sigh
1,@EndWokeness Robbery in LA is out of control
1,@LegendaryEnergy You know The Joker is running things when the law-abiding are being prosecuted by the government for not hiring criminals!  [Insert Sheetz pun]
1,@XDevelopers Nice work by several teams
1,@jk_rowling True
1,@DanielleFong Does make you feel sorry for the bots
1,And this is after Sheetz had to struggle for years with a challenging brand name!
1,@gfodor Humans don’t shoot lasers out of their eyes to drive; although that would be kinda cool
1,@tunguz Terminator was a great movie; but had some *major* plot holes if you think about it for even a split second!

1,Because he is against the will of the people and; therefore; democracy
1,@EndWokeness This is crazy
1,@cb_doge Just trying to follow the law in Brazil
1,@JoaquinTeixeira @tvglobo How much would it cost?
1,@iliketeslas @WholeMarsBlog Other cars change prices constantly and often by wide margins via dealer markups and manufacturer/dealer incentives. Only a fool thinks the “MSRP” is the real price.   Tesla prices must change frequently in order to match production with demand.
1,@TexasLindsay_ Yeah
1,@niccruzpatane @Tesla @WholeMarsBlog @tesla_na A Tesla can float briefly
1,@MarioNawfal To be clear; 𝕏 is only trying to follow the laws of Brazil without favor or disfavor to any political candidate
1,@MarioNawfal He went too far
1,@AnthonyLewayne Will address
1,@cb_doge Lot of work to achieve that; but yes
1,@dogeofficialceo Aliens
1,@krassenstein My politics are (I think) fairly moderate anyway.   - Safe cities - Secure borders - Neutral judiciary  - Sensible spending - Pro environment

1,@DavidSacks My biggest concern is that there is no exit strategy; just a forever war where kids die in trenches from artillery or charging machine guns and snipers through minefields.
1,@DavidSacks Crazy
1,@MarioNawfal They want to bankrupt 𝕏 Brazil
1,@PeterDiamandis That is the probable good outcome
1,@tunguz Yeah

1,@lelelemeng It may be possible very soon
1,@hisdirtremoves @SpaceX Pretty good approximation.   So much blood; sweat &amp; tears went into creating those pumps by a super talented team.
1,@Rothmus 😂   The machine of government
1,@Chesschick01 @RobertKennedyJr Yeah
1,@Kristennetten No; just that new credits would not be earned until we launch a future referral program; which is a few months away
1,@farzyness Indeed; the winds of free speech blow the foul stench of corruption away a little more each day
1,@MarioNawfal That would be assassination by legislation
1,@TrungTPhan Is the Civil War movie good?
1,@TheRabbitHole84 Yeah; those are my only two objections.   Adults have the right to do whatever they want to themselves; but leave kids and freedom of speech alone.
1,Your subscription is much appreciated.   The days ahead for defending freedom of speech will be tough.
1,And the gas savings are very real. That’s why so many Uber drivers use Tesla!
1,@MarioNawfal If it’s being pushed by Schiff it’s a scam
1,@natfriedman Seriously next-level
1,Turns out that free speech is actually very expensive
1,@cb_doge Unfortunately; very heavy Tesla obligations require that the visit to India be delayed; but I do very much look forward to visiting later this year.
1,@SawyerMerritt 12.4 is a big release. Should arguably be 13.

1,@xDaily Who is Karen Swisher?
1,The Australian censorship commissar is demanding *global* content bans!
1,Another major attack on the First Amendment by this administration
1,@imPenny2x Exactly
1,@shaunmmaguire It is a root vulnerability; but I don’t think the answer is to engage in reciprocal bans
1,Mad insurance regulation &amp; extremely high litigation costs are the root causes
1,In my opinion; TikTok should not be banned in the USA; even though such a ban may benefit the 𝕏 platform.   Doing so would be contrary to freedom of speech and expression. It is not what America stands for.
1,The opposition to free speech (under the guise of “hate speech”) in America by hard left activists is much greater than most people realize
1,@BillyM2k @Michael9Turk Botting for fake engagement
1,@cb_doge The main issue is reducing the quality of user experience. It’s fine to “engagement farm” with compelling content; but not with spam.
1,@BillyM2k Where did everyone go? 🤔
1,@alx Yeah
1,@Kristennetten Grok groks
1,@esherifftv @lrocket As it turns out; future versions of Raptor will ultimately exceed 700k lb-F!  Honing T/W; Isp and reliability are much harder than thrust though. Rocket engines desperately want to explode.
1,@cb_doge We will use Grok to detect; remove and trace to source the engagement farming spam
1,@TheAIStorytellr @PhysInHistory Good post
1,@PhysInHistory True.   Maxwell is underrated.

1,@unusual_whales The massive spending is unsustainable
1,@WholeMarsBlog There were no injuries or accidents because of this. We are just being very cautious.
1,@lexfridman Definitely.  It’s ok for a commercial media orgs to have political bias; but not taxpayer-funded orgs!
1,This is incredibly messed up
1,@WholeMarsBlog Yeah
1,The censorship actions against elected representatives demanded by @alexandre violate Brazilian law
1,Surely this is illegal?
1,@lindayaX @XcorpJP The 𝕏 Japan team is great
1,@cb_doge Exactly
1,@GregAbbott_TX Indeed
1,@MarioNawfal An odd thing to do
1,@pmarca True
1,@pmarca This is doom
1,@pmarca Makes me fear for the future of humanity
1,@DanFriedman81 Yikes!
1,Super-powerful AI programmed in this way has severe civilization-level risk
1,@uberliner @krmaher Understandable
1,@realchrisrufo @X People want to know the truth
1,@SawyerMerritt Inevitable
1,@SpeakerJohnson @SteveScalise @GOPMajorityWhip @RepStefanik Unconscionable
1,@GadSaad You’re right!
1,@jamesdouma This sounds about right
1,@DefiantLs Haha amazing
1,@stillgray Easy to predict. In fact; I did predict it.
1,@micsolana Exactly!
1,@MikeBenzCyber Another self-licking ice cream cone!
1,@KettlebellDan Me neither
1,Bring back Vine?
1,@lexfridman @LanguageMIT Interesting
1,This keeps getting crazier! The head of NPR hates the Constitution of the USA.
1,@jamesdouma Absolutely
1,Now imagine if this is programmed; explicitly or implicitly; into super powerful AI – it could end civilization.   Now; no need to imagine. It is already programmed into Google Gemini and OpenAI ChatGPT.
1,The software running in her head is the anti-Grok – hates truth &amp; humor 😂
1,@V24Investigates Concerning
1,@realchrisrufo No surprise
1,@cb_doge Nope
1,@alx Very well
1,@Rothmus Seriously
1,@SciGuySpace Bring it on
1,@micsolana Yeah; so this rounds down to almost zero
1,@realchrisrufo Andrew Carnegie is turning in his grave
1,@RandPaul This is crazy
1,@RandPaul Say what!?
1,@WholeMarsBlog Not quite betting the company; but going balls to the wall for autonomy is a blindingly obvious move.   Everything else is like variations on a horse carriage.
1,@growing_daniel Not unless we turn things around
1,@WholeMarsBlog Yeah
1,@billmaher True
1,@realchrisrufo Once you see that the true battle is expansionists vs extinctionists; you can’t unsee it
1,@realchrisrufo You get pretty much the same output if you prompt Grok to be so woke that it sounds parody 😂
1,@farzyness Be super careful about what schools teach your kids
1,@pmarca Yeah; it’s a potentially catastrophic problem
1,Legacy media simply can’t compete with hundreds of millions of humans providing real-time; AI-assisted; interactive information
1,Whoa; I just realized that raising a kid is basically 18 years of prompt engineering 🤯
1,@EndWokeness Sounds legit …
1,@GadSaad Suicidal empathy for the L
1,@shaunmmaguire Far worse indeed! Soviet-level.
1,@mtlawton @BarrowNeuro @neuralink Thank you for the excellent partnership with @Neuralink!
1,@EndWokeness This doesn’t seem just
1,@JohnnaCrider1 There are ~600 million active accounts on 𝕏; so the number they are talking about is a vanishingly tiny percentage of users &lt;0.00001%!
1,@GadSaad Terrible
1,@SawyerMerritt We are simplifying and streamlining the whole Tesla sales and delivery system. It has become complex and inefficient.
1,@pmarca Congrats
1,@ExposeDarkDeeds Terrible
1,@libsoftiktok Unconscionable
1,@DavidSacks Unfortunately; you are right
1,More than the population of 36 states in just over 3 years!  I am very much in favor of legal immigration; being an immigrant myself; but allowing a flood of millions of unvetted people to enter the United States illegally is insane.
1,When will this madness stop?
1,@TheRabbitHole84 NPR is run by woke Stasi
1,@ICannot_Enough Very half decade or so; Tesla has to do a complete organizational overhaul to reach the next level.   That said; our executive tenure is unusually high at well over 10 years at Tesla.
1,NPR has become a hard left propaganda machine that tolerates no dissent
1,@netcapgirl Happy birthday!
1,@stclairashley They burn the American flag and it’s not even considered a misdemeanor; but burning certain other flags is a felony
1,@DrJimFan Yeah
1,@eyeslasho But also the real world:
1,@libsoftiktok @CDHSSPARTANS This is absurd
1,@stevenmarkryan The final battle is beautiful; but easy.   Try that with Malenia. https://t.co/YeXodTFQex
1,@MaudMaron This will get *much* worse
1,@yacineMTB True
1,@slashdot Most people greatly underestimate solar &amp; wind
1,@cb_doge Feels so long ago
1,@LibertyCappy Really?
1,@DurantQuotesBot There is so little source material from history
1,@Rothmus Yeah
1,@njhochman @OversightPR Small world
1,@cb_doge AI would be very  dangerous if powerful; but trained to lie to be politically correct.  Imagine if instead of merely rendering forced “diverse” images; it decided to make that true in reality; potentially killing millions of people to achieve diversity goals.
1,@pmarca Yeah. D&amp;D was awesome. It actually demystifies demons; if anything.
1,@MinimalDuck @Tesla Cool; sorry it took so long for the auto wipers to work well. Harder than it seems.
1,@DC_Draino Good question
1,@MattWalshShow @MattWalshBlog Yeah
1,@MarioNawfal Messed up
1,@cstanley I left it in there on purpose
1,@AutismCapital Great movie
1,@teslaownersSV 😂  Just a nod to our future AI overlords
1,@America1stLegal Race-based tax audits? This is unabashed racism!
1,@alexthegrreat I’ve opened so many of those 😂  Makes it feel special; I guess
1,@Nexuist Good point
1,Interesting series about a potentially good future
1,@MarioNawfal @alexandre Exactly
1,@SpeakerJohnson Unfortunate that it has come to this; but necessary
1,@LibertyCappy Many things are obvious when you just consider simple incentives
1,@TRHLofficial It could work; but the mass and complexity is higher than a heat shield
1,@WesternLensman Deeply broken justice system
1,@stillgray Absolutely
1,United States laws prevent 𝕏 from participating in corruption that violates the laws of other countries; which is what @Alexandre is demanding that we do
1,@NASA Starship has the potential to return serious tonnage from Mars within ~5 years
1,@stillgray We’ve freed up over a million so far. Will free up tens of millions in the coming weeks.   However; as soon as we do this; the bot armies immediately snatch the namespace back again!
1,@GadSaad Isn’t discrimination on the basis of sex; race or sexual orientation illegal in Canada?
1,@JaiShreeRam90 @LauraLoomer What bothers me is that this is so asymmetric. The law is not being applied equally to Joe and Hunter Biden.
1,@icreatelife It’s a gamechanger. Took my pain level from 7 to 9 out of 10 to 1 to 4.
1,@xDaily The onslaught of fake accounts also uses up the available namespace; so many good handles are taken as a result
1,Interesting
1,If you’re experiencing severe neck/back pain; I recommend looking into a disc replacement.   If you do; err on the side of a disc with limited movement. A simple hinge is more likely to be effective than a high mobility artificial disc that can translate; as well as rotate.
1,@WholeMarsBlog That is way harder than paying a tiny fee.   This is only for new users. They will be able to do write actions for free after 3 months.
1,@MattWalshBlog This is insane!
1,@eyeslasho No surprise that she ran Wokipedia!
1,@stillgray Yeah; it wish it were otherwise
1,@dogeofficialceo I love it 😂
1,@xDaily Unfortunately; a small fee for new user write access is the only way to curb the relentless onslaught of bots.   Current AI (and troll farms) can pass “are you a bot” with ease.
1,@teslaownersSV Most people don’t understand how critical this is to AI safety
1,@Gfilche @Tesla After taking a well-deserved break; Drew will no doubt go on to do great things. I look forward to following what he does next.
1,@VivekGRamaswamy This is *actually* extremely damaging to our democracy!
1,@TheRabbitHole84 Haha actually true 💯
1,@BenjaminDEKR A quarter billion … wow
1,@VivekGRamaswamy It should be registered as a lobbying firm!
1,@pmarca @ylecun Oh those cheeky Sumerians with their base 60 number system!
1,@imPenny2x And it should have an amazing sense of humor!
1,@wintonARK Yeah
1,@Austen Yeah
1,@gdb That’s a feature
1,Worth noting that the actual brand safety score is almost perfect
1,@MarioNawfal Any nation with a birth rate below replacement will eventually cease to exist
1,Thanks to the 𝕏 team for discovering this and @DoubleVerify for responding quickly to correct the error
1,@farzyness @baglino @rohanspatel About every 5 years; we need to reorganize and streamline the company for the next phase of growth
1,@VivekGRamaswamy This case is obviously a corruption of the law.   Lawfare.
1,@rohanspatel @Tesla Thanks for everything you’ve done for Tesla. Much appreciated.
1,@Rainmaker1973 The Starship stack is the largest flying object by far at ~5000 metric tons
1,@baglino Thanks for everything you’ve done for Tesla. Few have contributed as much as you.
1,Greece is one of dozens of countries experiencing population collapse due to low birth rates
1,@BigBrotherWatch @DrJBhattacharya Interesting

1,@lindayaX @ayumu_matsuyama @KylieMTweets @XcorpJP 𝕏 Japan team is excellent!
1,@ElonMuskAOC Good question
1,@SethDillon Yeah
1,@stillgray Arresting people for *adhering* to the law is the definition of tyranny
1,@cb_doge Feels like aeons ago
1,@amuse Children should never be castrated. Crazy that this even needs to be said.
1,@WallStreetSilv The real President is whoever controls the teleprompter
1,@stillgray So many original ideas in Fallout. Love it.   The show was created by a close friend of mine. Super good guy.
1,@realchrisrufo This person is a crazy racist!
1,@micsolana I love Starbucks tbh
1,Create or join 𝕏 Communities!
1,@DrJimFan Two sources of data scale infinitely: synthetic data; which has an “is it true?” problem and real-world video; which does not.

1,@stillgray Good point
1,The refreshing breeze of the Overton window opening
1,@daltybrewer @alex_avoigt It is hard to believe until you try it.   Like saying you have a frog that can sing and dance; but it looks like a normal frog until it suddenly gets up and … https://t.co/ND6QrlCFsB
1,@SawyerMerritt @UnpluggedTesla Cool
1,@RenataKonkoly @KettlebellDan I did actually have a fish-driving car!  With my pet fish; Eric.
1,@KettlebellDan Getting in a car will be like getting in an elevator – you won’t even think about it.  There was a time when elevators were operated manually by a guy with a power switch. Now; that is very rare.

1,@TheIncorrupt_ His personal lawyer to the Supreme Court?
1,@stillgray Not true.   Humanity should transition to sustainable energy as fast as reasonably possible; but we have at least a few decades to do so.
1,And the appeal process is a sham
1,@PlanetOfMemes @Rothmus AI will solve this (slight chance of killing us)

1,Glad Tesla FSD was there to help and that you’re feeling well!
1,@thackerpd This makes a mockery of FOIA
1,@jdotarnold Thanks for doing this. While tried hard to do the right thing.
1,Congrats SpaceX Team &amp; @SpaceForceDoD on completing 3 orbital Vandenberg launches in 11 days!  Might be a record.
1,Tyranny
1,@VivekGRamaswamy Yup; they proudly so say on their website!
1,@Rothmus Can’t take that example too literally. What’s meant is generally argue with strangers on the Internet about trivia.
1,@robbystarbuck They won’t denounce “Death to America”!?  That is traitorous behavior.
1,@Rothmus True
1,@EndWokeness Death to America in America?
1,The severity of the censorship and the degree to which Brazil’s own laws are being broken; to the detriment of their own people; is the worst of any country in the world in which this platform operates.
1,Accurate
1,@ClownWorld_ Poor guy
1,@WildfireWhisper They did. ~45 years ago.
1,@nypost Inevitable

1,@MarioNawfal Interesting 🧐
1,@BillyM2k @TheRabbitHole84 Yeah
1,@Not_the_Bee Fake Q&amp;A. It doesn’t count if you know what’s going to be asked beforehand!
1,@TonyadeVitti @SpaceX Several changes from that design; but the general approach remains the same
1,@Grimezsz Cool concept for an irl performance
1,@LibertyCappy Hmm good point
1,@JTLonsdale True!
1,Sounds balanced … 😂
1,Exactly
1,@robbystarbuck Problem with idiotic; Roach Motel laws like this is that no grocery store will take a risk on San Francisco if they can’t get out
1,@xDaily No kidding
1,@MarioNawfal Absolutely
1,We were asked to suspend sitting members of the Brazilian parliament and many journalists
1,@stillgray Yeah
1,Exactly. Dictator @Alexandre.
1,𝕏 just received an inquiry from the US House of Representatives regarding actions taken in Brazil that were in violation of Brazilian law.  There were hundreds; if not thousands.  This is getting spicy 🌶️
1,@MarioNawfal Tell us more about these NGOs …
1,@MarioNawfal Sorry about this.   It is our top priority to stabilize Spaces for large international audiences.
1,@VivekGRamaswamy Yes!  Many politicians view winning the election as the end goal and thereafter leave everything to the career civil service staff.  Once in a while someone tries to do something.  https://t.co/h0D3EWsllj

1,@shellenberger Would be good to have a short version too
1,𝕏 algorithm update coming soon with more bangers and less clickbait!
1,@tblckn Seeing a Facebook link is like an @aol.com email address 😂
1,Exactly
1,@stillgray How far NPR has fallen …
1,Looking forward to meeting with Prime Minister @NarendraModi in India!
1,𝕏 respects the laws of Brazil and all countries in which we operate.  When given an order to break the law; we must refuse.
1,@WallStreetSilv Madness!
1,@ggreenwald They should seek justice in the absolute; rather than injustice; but for the other side
1,@JudiciaryGOP An efficient warrant process makes sense; but not; in effect; no warrant process!
1,@GOPoversight Crazy that this isn’t a question already!
1,With Starlink; it feels like you’re on the ground; rather than in the air!
1,@catturd2 @libsoftiktok Is the legacy media covering this at all?
1,@MarioNawfal A thorough house-cleaning is needed at NPR
1,You are most welcome 🙏
1,@Bubblebathgirl True
1,@HowThingsWork_ Yea; the difference is visibly stark
1,@BrianRoemmele Indeed
1,Brave man
1,@scottbuscemi It is how sterling should work
1,@BrianRoemmele Beautiful
1,@DimaZeniuk @Starlink Cool
1,@MarioNawfal No one on the left has been censored on this platform; as they were never censored.   We have simply allowed the other half of the country to have a voice too.
1,@BBCBreaking He was an especially smart human
1,@TimRunsHisMouth How odd …
1,@zerohedge NPR –&gt; RIP
1,Precisely   https://t.co/mbnnpIHVbD
1,@LeadingReport Encouraging
1,@tunguz They dug their own grave
1,@Rothmus Crazy
1,@WallStreetSilv Exactly
1,@libsoftiktok The legacy media; with notable exceptions; is almost entirely a Democratic Party propaganda machine
1,@GadSaad Great book
1,@Rothmus Yup; but the legacy media; being Biden’s shameless political cheering squad; doesn’t care.   If these diary entries were about Trump;we would see nonstop headline news.
1,@richardkoo @ashleevance Yeah
1,@stillgray Exactly. It is absurd to claim that tyranny is necessary to save democracy.
1,@BillMelugin_ So crazy!
1,Accurate
1,Much appreciated
1,@EndWokeness It has become the “cool kids club”
1,@shaunmmaguire Wow.   Free speech is indeed at risk.   The whole purpose of debate is to explore different points of view.   Who disinvited you? Shame on them!
1,@shaunmmaguire Yeah
1,@Julia_Hexican @AutismCapital Exactly
1,@AutismCapital Many years ago; Wired somehow went from being about technology to being an unreadable; far-left wing propaganda mouthpiece.   From their standpoint; everything is “far-right”!  Did they cite any examples of someone actually breaking the law?
1,@libsoftiktok We’re definitely oversubscribing drugs to kids
1,And fast
1,@libsoftiktok Criminals will move wherever crime is easiest

1,Starlink now available in Albania!
1,@WesternLensman That’s the real problem – no end game is ever specified; just a forever war
1,@GailAlfarATX The fear not deception; but the truth
1,@ggreenwald People don’t understand the severity of the situation
1,@stillgray The plot thickens …
1,@Rothmus @LibertyCappy Bullseye
1,@stillgray It is interesting to read Orwell’s account of the Spanish civil war. He started out fighting for the communists …
1,@robbystarbuck Exactly
1,@pmarca Madness
1,@VigilantFox Wild times
1,@VivekGRamaswamy Only a matter of time
1,@alx He is the Dictator of Brazil; but; for some reason; doesn’t want to be thought of that way 🤷‍♂️   Why not just own it …
1,@nikolas_dm They have been told they will be arrested
1,@nikolas_dm We need to get our employees in Brazil to a safe place or otherwise not in a position of responsibility; then we will do a full data dump
1,@MarioNawfal He demanded that 𝕏 suspend accounts of people who raised corruption concerns while insisting that 𝕏 pretend the suspension was for violating our terms of service!  We obey the laws of countries even if we disagree with them; but this required violating the laws of Brazil.
1,@stillgray Let’s see what happens
1,@ChayaRaichik10 @streitmarissa My pronouns are Prosecute/Fauci
1,@cb_doge They haven’t been given their marching orders
1,How did @Alexandre de Moraes become the dictator of Brazil? He has Lula on a leash 😂
1,Great idea 😂
1,@DiligentDenizen Starlink will provide free Internet for schools in Brazil if the government won’t honor their contract
1,@DiligentDenizen Moraes is the (obviously) unelected dictator of Brazil
1,@ggreenwald It does sound familiar
1,@marcelvanhattem @alexandre But since Alexandre pulled Lula out of prison and put his thumb on the scale to get Lula elected; Lula will obviously not take action against him.   The next election will be key.
1,The law applies to all; including @Alexandre. He should be on trial for his crimes.
1,@ggreenwald How long until Dictator Moraes is deposed; do you think?
1,@marcelvanhattem Why does the parliament allow @alexandre the power of a brutal dictator?   They were elected; he was not.   Throw him out.
1,View of the eclipse from orbit  https://t.co/2jQGNhPf2v

1,𝕏 supports the people of Brazil; without regard to political affiliation.   Does Judge @Alexandre?
1,[Scene: @Alexandre &amp; @ElonMusk in psychoanalysis]  I say; “Tell me; Alexandre; is the disinformation in the room with us now?”
1,This is the heart of the problem. What say you @Alexandre?  Let us debate this in the open.

1,@RobertKennedyJr Thank you. Free speech is fundamental to democracy.
1,Well said
1,@cb_doge The resemblance is uncanny 😂
1,More Starlink DTC satellites rolling out
1,This is crazy; as it makes fraud impossible to detect
1,@TexasLindsay_ @alexandre Brazil’s Darth Vader!
1,Coming shortly; 𝕏 will publish everything demanded by @Alexandre and how those requests violate Brazilian law.   This judge has brazenly and repeatedly betrayed the constitution and people of Brazil. He should resign or be impeached.  Shame @Alexandre; shame.
1,@eyeslasho Why are females down across all? Takes two to tango.
1,@TheRabbitHole84 Yeah
1,@otis9usa @Rainmaker1973 Inter-satellite lasers are currently only used if the satellite cannot see the user terminal and ground station simultaneously. Over ocean; it’s all lasers.   Future software upgrades will evaluate whether lowest latency is via immediately going to a ground station or traversing
1,@joehansenxx @Rainmaker1973 Over 10.000 space lasers in operation
1,@Rainmaker1973 Except for Starlink; which communicates via space lasers.   Light travels ~40% faster in vacuum than fiber optics and on a more direct path; rather than following the outline of continents; so Starlink will be much faster over time than ocean cables.   This is important.

1,@MuskUniversity I love my team
1,@cb_doge Content restrictions in Brazil have been removed
1,@realpfigueiredo We are lifting all restrictions. This judge has applied massive fines; threatened to arrest our employees and cut off access to 𝕏 in Brazil.   As a result; we will probably lose all revenue in Brazil and have to shut down our office there.   But principles matter more than
1,@DimaZeniuk Great :)
1,@WallStreetSilv The AP is responsible for more false information than all “anonymous” accounts combined. It’s not even close.

1,@alex_avoigt Tesla is an AI/robotics and sustainable energy company
1,@cb_doge True!
1,@seanpk An historic day
1,@WallStreetSilv It is
1,@SawyerMerritt Cool
1,@EdKrassen Civilization needs to retain its current technology level until Mars is self-sufficient; which could be achieved within ~20 years.   If we become multiplanetary and then multistellar our civilization will last millions of years.  If not; maybe just a few hundred years.

1,@sobieski902 Pretty much.   It has been staggeringly difficult to make generalized self-driving work; requiring all that you describe above and more.   The investment in training compute; gigantic data pipelines and vast video storage will be well over $10B cumulatively this year.   But that
1,@_BRCooper @WholeMarsBlog Interesting analysis

1,@MrBeast Cool
1,@alx @APStylebook In reality; AP is losing both its cultural relevance and its customers.   Hardly a week goes by without some legacy publication announcing layoffs or going out of business.

1,@Scobleizer Yeah
1,@WholeMarsBlog Tesla would be happy to do such deals
1,@alx Such ingrates 😂

1,@BillyM2k Always been true
1,@SawyerMerritt Tesla is increasing comp (contingent on progress milestones) of our AI engineering team
1,@SawyerMerritt Ethan is very talented; but “vision chief” would be overstating things.   There are over 200 excellent engineers in the Tesla AI/Autonomy team. Tesla’s pace of progress with autonomy is accelerating.   The talent war for AI is the craziest talent war I’ve ever seen!
1,@DavidSacks My track record of predictions is; if anything; optimistic
1,@SawyerMerritt Ethan was going to join OpenAI; so it was either xAI or them.   They have been aggressively recruiting Tesla engineers with massive compensation offers and have unfortunately been successful in a few cases.
1,@WholeMarsBlog And we will license the tech to other car companies
1,@WholeMarsBlog Yeah; should be obvious
1,@Rothmus Haha true
1,@GadSaad Sorry to hear that
1,@zerohedge The battle to eliminate racist; sexist; etc programs like DEI and ESG is far from over; but the trend is positive

1,While I don’t own any Disney shares today; I would definitely buy their shares if Nelson were elected to the board.   His track record is excellent.
1,Nelson Peltz should definitely be on the Disney board!  He would help reform the company; improve the quality of product and generally serve in the best interests of shareholders; as he has done at many other companies.   This would significantly improve Disney’s share price.

1,@EndWokeness Exactly.   America would become a permanent one-party; deep blue socialist state.

1,@imPenny2x @creation247 @ZubyMusic The morals can certainly exist without religion; but; unless birth rate changes; civilizational suicide is inevitable.  Ironically; for someone who knows so much about evolution; Dawkins only has one child. That is a &gt;50% generational suicide rate.
1,@ZubyMusic You’re probably right
1,@pmarca McKinsey lied
1,@bennyjohnson Biden doesn’t really know what’s going on. It’s the far left machine that’s responsible.

1,@TrungTPhan I know this feeling
1,@WholeMarsBlog Long-term; solar &amp; wind with batteries wins; but mostly solar; as it crushes everything at 1GW/km^2.   The Sahara alone could power Earth several times over.   A corner of Utah or Texas could power all of North America; including Canada and Mexico.

1,@GadSaad Great!  A future with more empathy would be wonderful; but this can only be done from a position of strength.   If the weak favor empathy; but the strong do not; the weak will be enslaved or killed; as happened with the pacifist Moriori: https://t.co/OoWH8LsETk

1,@pmarca It’s just what resonates with our limbic system.   Evolutionarily; news about danger was far more important than good news; as the former could result in your death.   Those who did not respond to danger did not procreate – only the paranoid survived.  In modern times; the danger
1,@ID_AA_Carmack The right way to grade any technology is not comparing it to competitors (too easy); but comparing it to the limit of physics.  That is; for example; how we grade Starlink latency; which shows that there is still a *lot* of room for improvement!  Same for $/ton to Mars.
1,@pmarca That is indeed the problem

1,@eerac @paulg Once you move beyond the level of what can be personally consumed; it is now about capital allocation efficiency.   The government is about an order of magnitude worse than the private sector.
1,@paulg The fundamental error of socialism; which smart people still fall for; is shifting capital allocation from highly effective entrepreneurs to astonishingly ineffective government.   This dramatically reduces total goods &amp; services output; which determines our standard of living.

1,@EndWokeness Yup; hoax-making in process.   And it is surprisingly effective!
1,@paulg Based on the number of illegals entering the United States and stacking the electoral deck via the census; he is correct
1,Legacy media lies
1,@GadSaad Probably reduced to 20 and out within ~10
1,@paulg Sounds like the NPC chorus has some success. Did you watch the video? Trump is referring to job losses in the auto industry.
1,Easy to tell who is an NPC today https://t.co/8u6IcUrehE
1,@zerohedge Concerning
1,@nypost Why is the National Guard needed to keep the subways safe?
1,@JoeNBC Jan 6 was not a “bloodbath” by any definition and Trump was referring to job losses in the auto industry when he used that word. Your post is extremely misleading.
1,@Rainmaker1973 Whoa
1,@nypost Sounds pretty bad
1,@NBCNews This headline is deceptive; as he was referring to the auto industry. Shame on NBC.
1,@cb_doge Happy picture

1,@ajtourville Exactly
1,@TheRabbitHole84 They are programmed relentlessly to think so
1,Interesting
1,@GadSaad @TheDemocrats The mainstream view of the Dem party will be antisemitic within 5 to 10 years.  It is an inevitable outcome of the weak-makes-right moral foundation.   For most of history (and still most of the world) it was might-makes-right. This has overcorrected to weak-makes-right.

1,@TheRabbitHole84 Are they even having sex or kids?  At the end of the day; birth rate is all that matters for civilizational continuity.
1,It is important that women know the effects of hormonal birth control; as it is a significant cause of depression and increases suicide risk.  This is not a value statement; just a public service announcement. Other forms of birth control do not have these effects.
1,The most entertaining outcome – as if we’re in a soap opera – is the most likely  ERM
1,@robbystarbuck Large scale falsification of data. Hmm …

1,@stclairashley Absolutely
1,@krassenstein Bernie is a communist; obviously
1,@RichardDawkins That is not my experience.   I also think the distinction between science and engineering is a foolish one; aimed primarily at puffing up the self-importance of those who call themselves the former.   What actually matters is working on the limiting factor. Sometimes; that is

1,@JamesEsses “Cis” is a slur

1,@JamesEsses Wow; that’s dark
1,@RichardDawkins Starship is the first rocket/spacecraft capable of making life multiplanetary.  What really matters for the preservation and extension of consciousness is extending it beyond Earth to the rest of the solar system and; ultimately; to millions of stars.

1,@BillyM2k 😂  That thought has crossed my mind several times
1,Even though I think Don 🍋 is a pompous fool who spouts nonsense; he is still free to upload his show to 𝕏 and will receive advertising revenue
1,Why does the radical far left Biden administration welcome violent illegals into America to prey upon your friends &amp; family?  We are even warned by other countries that it is insane to make America a haven for their convicted criminals!
1,The far left US administration is using your tax dollars to fly violent criminals into America
1,@pmarca True
1,@waitbutwhy Max payload of Starship V1 in expendable mode (like the other rockets) is ~200 tons.   V3 is expected to be ~200 tons with full reusability and ~400 tons expendable. Length will grow by 20 to 30 meters and thrust to ~10k tons.
1,@MarioNawfal Starlink still works
1,@Jim_Jordan Strange that they would withhold his information

1,@AdamLowisz @ashleevance I have a lot of Democrat friends; but they are increasingly switching to Republican
1,@ashleevance If things go well; SpaceX will put about 50% more tonnage in orbit this year using Falcon; which would be above 90% market share.   Once Starship is in full swing building a city on Mars; it will do ~99% of all payload to orbit &amp; beyond; as that objective requires about a megaton

1,@SteveGuest @stillgray Objecting to rolling out the red (in more ways than one) carpet for homicidal cannibals seems like a reasonable position to me
1,@Kristennetten @stillgray Those are jarring; to say the least.  The nonchalant nature of the cannibalism makes it even more disturbing.
1,@stillgray If wanting to screen immigrants for potential homicidal tendencies and cannibalism makes me “right wing”; then I would gladly accept such a label!  Failure to do so would put innocent Americans in mortal risk.  Shame on NBC. Shame; shame; shame.
1,@farzyness Interesting
1,@MarkZuckss @XBusiness His approach was basically just “CNN; but on social media”; which doesn’t work; as evidenced by the fact that CNN is dying.

1,Now; 10 times as many people per year are “pouring over the border”; to use Obama’s words.  America is 4% of Earth’s population. If even 1% of Earth moves here – and there is every incentive to do so – that is 80 million people.

1,Exactly
1,@jgebbia True!
1,@SpeakerJohnson Major problems
1,Most Americans are still unaware that the census counts ALL people; including illegal immigrants; for deciding how many House seats each state gets!  This results in Dem states getting roughly 20 more House seats; which is another strong incentive for them not to deport illegals.

1,@SawyerMerritt That’s how you know the reporter *really* hates Tesla and/or is being fed this bs by a PR (aka propaganda) company paid by the lawyers
1,Moreover the “Border Protection” bill would have allowed Mayorkas to place new illegals on a fast-track to US citizenship. This fact is almost never mentioned.
1,Someone should download the CBP One app and make a step by step video of this insanity.   That’s a lot of planes and a lot of airports. Amazing that they kept this secret for so long.
1,@dogeofficialceo That stuff is amazing
1,@TheRabbitHole84 This note will soon get downvoted; but it is nonetheless concerning.   All data and code is open source; so let’s figure out what happened here.
1,Treason indeed! Ushering in vast numbers of illegals is why Secretary Mayorkas was impeached by the House.  They are importing voters. This is why groups on the far left fight so hard to stop voter ID requirements; under the absurd guise of protecting the right to vote.
1,@CIS_org That Senate bill would have increased; not decreased; illegal immigration and made it almost impossible for states like Texas to challenge the law by pushing all challenges to the DC Circuit
1,@dogeofficialceo I’m ready to fight Zuck anywhere; anytime with any rules. LFG!!!
1,@MarioNawfal These are either the dumbest eco-terrorists on Earth or they’re puppets of those who don’t have good environmental goals.   Stopping production of electric vehicles; rather than fossil fuel vehicles; ist extrem dumm.
1,@thomasopeters @stillgray “Non US citizens without passports” is a code phrase for undocumented illegal immigrants who have the special government envelope.   US citizens and visitors from other countries still need US government-issued ID or a passport.
1,@astro_greek We are actually the same person
1,@stillgray Ironically; he missed the irony
1,@stclairashley It is obvious to anyone who is not a fool that this administration is deliberately importing vast numbers of illegals.   No grand conspiracy theory is needed to explain this; just simple incentives: they are far more likely to vote Democrat than Republican.   This is why Dems are
1,In case you were wondering how superconductors work; this is a good explanation. They are a very interesting phenomenon and may prove economically useful; but are not a hard requirement for a sustainable energy future.   Physics has many powerful tools of reasoning to understand
1,@dogeofficialceo I’m still up for it
1,@cb_doge Seems just as bad as Gemini

1,@HistoricHive He was amazing.   One of the best compliments ever given was said about Wellington:  “He states every difficulty before he undertakes any service; but none after he has undertaken it.”
1,Three things America needs:  - Secure borders - Safe cities - Sensible spending
1,@Kristennetten I have

1,@GadSaad It is indeed
1,@SonuMandel1 @stats_feed If America doesn’t stop extreme overspending; the entire federal budget will just be interest payments
1,@stats_feed Yikes!
1,@howmanyare2many @EndWokeness The media have their marching orders
1,@RCamposDuffy I was surprised to learn of the large role of religious charities in supporting illegals

1,@dani_elle831 Sure

1,@esherifftv @stclairashley @KanekoaTheGreat @VivekGRamaswamy @CabelloAuden Crazy times
1,@BillyM2k Obviously my fault; but damn we better do something about this or the whole federal budget will just be interest payments with nothing left for anything else!
1,Heck of a coincidence 😂 https://t.co/g6GinUKeE4
1,@luiswenus Yeah; it is alarmingly easy
1,@RandPaul We at least need to know where exactly the money is going and what the exit strategy is.  Either way; government spending is out of control.
1,@Jason Yeah; this structure is either legal and everyone should do it or it is illegal and OpenAI is a house of cards
1,Yeah
1,@Erdayastronaut Yeah
1,@WholeMarsBlog That is what surprises people most
1,@Jason @vkhosla @OpenAI Vinod doesn’t know what he is talking about here

1,@GavinSBaker @MrBlonde_macro @AnthPB True
1,@thejefflutz No; because this is the current peak speed per beam and the beams are large; so this system is only effective where there is no existing cellular service.  This service works in partnership with wireless providers; like what @SpaceX and @TMobile announced.
1,SpaceX just achieved peak download speed of 17Mb/s from satellite direct to unmodified Samsung Android phone https://t.co/JqPHmkriv0
1,@MarioNawfal That is one of the fundamental questions
1,The massive flood of illegal immigration is due to 94 executive actions by the Biden administration.   Until those executive actions are revoked; claims by Biden that he wants to address illegal immigration are a bold-faced lie.

1,@paulg True
1,@GuntherEagleman The Democrat Party is quite literally the party for criminals; as criminals vote &gt;90% Dem; as they are the soft-on-crime party! Simple incentives explain behavior.
1,@MikeBenzCyber Yeah
1,The magnitude of the fraud in government payments (your tax dollars being spent) is MUCH higher than you think!
1,Because those media organizations were paid by USAID and they don’t want to confess their crimes
1,@MLiamMcCollum @RonPaul Good idea
1,@DavidSHolz Good point
1,The Dems are trying to hide possibly the biggest fraud scheme in human history!
1,Exactly
1,@SpaceX69_420 @permabulla @BillKristol I meant melanin 😂   Shows I’m retarded too!
1,@Geiger_Capital @profgalloway Totally inappropriate!
1,@permabulla @BillKristol This idea that Jewish people are “not white” is ridiculous. Someone like Kristol is peak white; if anything.  That dude barely has any melatonin!
1,@BillKristol There is no greater evidence against white supremacy than an idiot like Kristol!

1,Swisher &amp; Galloway are threatening talented; young software engineers who are gave up high compensation for death threats in order to help the American people.   Shame on Swisher &amp; Galloway; cruel; mean &amp; deceitful human beings that they are!
1,USAID pressured advertisers to boycott any media that was not left-wing!
1,She just wants the fraud &amp; waste to continue
1,The @DOGE team; at the direction of the President &amp; his leadership team; is making great progress improving the efficiency of how your tax dollars are spent.   I am confident that almost any fully informed American will be happy with the results.
1,This is kinda true 😂
1,The meme that American tax dollars were funding both sides of the conflict was real!
1,The Democratic Party still doesn’t realize how many Americans they have alienated with their shady; ironically UNDEMOCRATIC tactics.   Against the wishes of their electorate; they stopped Bernie from being the candidate several years ago; then trashed RFK very unfairly and then
1,@DonaldJTrumpJr Mental illness

1,So true 🤣🤣
1,@MaxwellFrostFL What is this “Department of Education” you keep talking about?  I just checked and it doesn’t exist.

1,True
1,True
1,Confirm Kash now
1,Absolutely
1,Doesn’t that seem odd? 🤔
1,@MarioNawfal She should be fired immediately
1,Unbelievable
1,True.   Soros figured out how to leverage a relatively small amount of his money into massive taxpayer money.
1,@farzyness The savings is much higher than that. Fully loaded average cost per federal employee; including benefits; is &gt;$250k.   Also; private contractors used and purchase orders issued are proportionate to headcount.   A useful rule of thumb is probably closer to $1M per federal employee
1,The Democratic Party is dying by their own hand

1,Why should American taxpayer dollars fund the British Broadcasting Corporation!? That’s insane.
1,Billions of taxpayer dollars to known FRAUDULENT entities are STILL being APPROVED by Treasury.   This needs to STOP NOW!

1,@ZubyMusic Yes. You can tell by how upset the swamps creatures are!

1,This GAO report is damning: https://t.co/hjjhIXCMAy

1,Seriously. I hear this all the time!  Demonstrates an utter lack of respect for how your hard-earned money is spent.
1,Obviously; @DOGE is trying to STOP your tax dollars from being stolen for WASTE and FRAUD.   @RepJeffries wants that to continue.
1,That is an insane misallocation of resources!
1,Interesting 🤨
1,Awesome 😎
1,USAID has been pushing censorship laws in Europe
1,Would you like @DOGE to audit the IRS?
1,@MikeBenzCyber Whoa
1,@NotJackDeth Good question
1,If they want to cancel @DOGE in exchange for deleting everything in the federal government that isn’t explicit law passed by Congress; I would gladly take that deal!  But they would never do it. Not in a million years.
1,@JackPosobiec @JohnRatcliffe Cool
1,Vindman wants his bribe money
1,He’s mad that @DOGE is dismantling the radical-left shadow government in full view of the public.  This is our ONE CHANCE to return POWER to the PEOPLE from an unelected BUREAUcracy back to DEMOcracy!!  Only with the support of YOU can this succeed. Thank you; unknown soldiers.

1,@SenJoniErnst They were trying to hide their corruption
1,Defund NPR. It should survive on its own.   https://t.co/dtm5qbbxix
1,When @SenJoniErnst asked to review USAID financials; they threatened to sue her!   Now; why would a US taxpayer funded organization do such a thing? Corruption.    https://t.co/g0tMm92R2N
1,Exactly
1,US government funding for radical-left causes has corrupted religious institutions domestically and throughout the world
1,What Raskin actually means is that he wants his kickbacks and bribes to continue.   US lobbying/law firms who launder foreign donations (which are actually US taxpayer foreign aid coming full circle!) need to be investigated and shut down.
1,That is exactly what is happening!
1,Oh look; an “insurrection”!!!  The radical left put a lot of innocent people in prison for exactly this behavior.
1,BBC is literally state-funded media
1,She says that they took down “incriminating books”.   Now I’m curious.   Like; Communist Manifesto or what? 😂
1,They’re an arm of the radical-left globalists
1,It is against the law.
1,Hysterical reactions like this is how you know that @DOGE is doing work that really matters.  This is the one shot the American people have to defeat BUREAUcracy; rule of the bureaucrats; and restore DEMOcracy; rule of the people. We’re never going to get another chance like

1,Fraud in the federal government is closer to 10% of disbursements; so more like ~$700 billion per year.  Outright waste is at least 15%; so another trillion+ dollars.   Anyone who works in government knows this.

1,@m_franceschetti @DOGE Thanks!
1,I don’t see them waving any American flags
1,Exactly
1,The corrupt politicians “protesting” outside the USAID building are the ones getting money from USAID.   That’s why they’re there – they want your stolen tax dollars!
1,Another description for these types of payments is “money laundering”
1,Oh well
1,@DavidSacks Audit the audit too
1,Time to confess:   Media reports saying that @DOGE has some of world’s best software engineers are in fact true.
1,Excellent action by @RepMTG!
1,@Jason @dylanmatt Exactly
1,Thank you; receipt via 𝕏 acknowledged.
1,Yeah; exactly! The only way to stop fraud and waste of taxpayer money is to follow the payment flows and pause suspicious transactions for review. Obviously.  Naturally; this causes those who have been aiding; abetting and receiving fraudulent payments very upset.   Too bad.

1,No kidding …
1,USAID is a criminal organization
1,Activist judges must be removed from the bench or there is no justice
1,True
1,That is exactly how the scam works
1,@growing_daniel Some real aces in @DOGE
1,@PJ4Trump What’s the tip?
1,@ggreenwald They’re not even good at it
1,@Anc_Aesthetics The political appointees to USAID and most large government bureaucracies are largely decorative
1,True
1,The level of fraud in government entitlements spending is insane!
1,With regard to leakers: if in doubt; they are out
1,@BasedMikeLee Absolutely
1,We spent the weekend feeding USAID into the wood chipper.   Could gone to some great parties.  Did that instead.
1,@LadyKellDiva Exactly
1,Interesting

1,Unreal …
1,Yeah; not fixable
1,@BasedMikeLee Exactly
1,No highs; no lows; only @DOGE
1,What happened to the rest of the money?
1,Crazy waste of money
1,@Austen What the Vox scammer forgot to mention is that they’re on the take from USAID and other government agencies
1,Nothing polls higher than cutting government spending
1,This is the way
1,Insane wasting of taxpayer money

1,@nicksortor No; they tried to lie to cover up their corruption
1,Good question
1,Career Treasury officials are breaking the law every hour of every day by approving payments that are fraudulent or do not match the funding laws passed by Congress.   This needs to stop NOW!   https://t.co/Y0RMNebEWq
1,@JackPosobiec Interesting
1,@MarioNawfal Fake news
1,Absolutely! It’s a scam to get around the laws passed by Congress to protect the people.
1,Did you know that USAID; using YOUR tax dollars; funded bioweapon research; including COVID-19; that killed millions of people?
1,Just had an excellent conversation with @SenToddYoung.   I stand corrected.   Senator Young will be a great ally in restoring power to the people from the vast; unelected bureaucracy.
1,This is the way
1,Thank you @Eric_Schmitt!
1,Tom Homan is the Judge Dredd we need
1,USAID is a criminal organization

1,USAID is a criminal organization.   Time for it to die.
1,DEI means people DIE
1,Good
1,Absolutely. Returning to merit above all will save many innocent lives.   So much damage was done by the prior administration.
1,Absolutely. The federal government has squandered your hard-earned tax money. It’s an outrage.
1,Only US military forces can defeat the cartels
1,@shaunmmaguire True
1,It’s amazing what you can learn from device forensics. They won’t get away with their crimes.
1,USAID is evil
1,USAID was a viper’s nest of radical-left marxists who hate America
1,@marlahohner @DataRepublican I am a fan of @EliseStefanik.   Anyone with integrity needs to resign from NED. That evil organization needs to be dissolved.
1,@marlahohner @DataRepublican I just sent Elise a note asking exactly that

1,@Rothmus There are some good people at the FBI with high integrity; but we definitely need to exit the bad apples

1,Texas and Nevada are the best choices for incorporation
1,🇺🇸🇺🇸 Bravo Britain!! 🇬🇧 🇬🇧
1,@karpathy Yeah
1,Any lawyer still recommending incorporation in Delaware at this point should be sued for malpractice

1,@Kjjetfan @robbystarbuck @DOGE Crime on a scale that makes the mafia look like pre-schoolers stealing cookies
1,The @DOGE team discovered; among other things; that payment approval officers at Treasury were instructed always to approve payments; even to known fraudulent or terrorist groups.   They literally never denied a payment in their entire career.   Not even once.

1,This is insane
1,Interesting
1,This is the critical battle to restore power to the PEOPLE from the massive unelected bureaucracy!  If your elected representatives cannot overcome the bureaucrats who control government; then you live in a BUREAUcracy; not a DEMOcracy!   Tyranny.
1,Almost 80% of “refugees” go on vacation to the country they claim to have fled from …
1,True. Violent criminals are a very small percentage of the population; but they will keep inflicting violence on innocent people until they’re locked up.   It is cruel to the victims of crime not to lock up criminals!!
1,True
1,Inflation is caused by government spending
1,Can you believe it? 🤷‍♂️🤣
1,Fixing this is essential
1,@Rothmus Go woke; go broke
1,The real economy is not money; it is goods &amp; services.   Money is simply an abstract representation of real things.

1,@Rothmus I’d fix it; but I don’t work there anymore 😂
1,True
1,True
1,@sabback @realDonaldTrump Madness
1,@DataRepublican Before even getting to timed scripts; the  number of government jobs that could be replaced simply with a mouse macro is astounding!
1,As predicted
1,Reducing the federal deficit from $2T to $1T in FY2026 requires cutting an average of ~$4B/day in projected 2026 spending from now to Sept 30.   That would still result in a ~$1T deficit; but economic growth should be able to match that number; which would mean no inflation in

1,It really is a fair &amp; generous deal

1,@Bubblebathgirl @crampell Good idea
1,@nikthestorm Yes; even in the unlikely event that the money was actually spent on condoms; we should NOT be sending US taxpayer money to buy condoms for foreigners 🤦‍♂️
1,My guess is that a lot of that money ended up in the pockets Hamas; not actually condoms
1,True
1,@TheRabbitHole84 They’re being too generous; at least for now.   Lowering the deficit by $1T requires saving ~$3B/day average. Saving $1.8T (current deficit) requires ~$5B/day.  Current rate of improvement is ~$1B/day; but will improve rapidly.

1,@tjmurphy_mit @thesheetztweetz @ExploreMars @SpaceX @TheeSpaceDude The outer ring of booster engines (20 of 28) have no TVC actuators.

1,@Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @DJSnM Raptor reached 230 mT-F (over half a million pounds of thrust) at peak pressure with some damage; so this version of the engine can probably sustain ~210 tons. Should have a 250+ ton engine in about 6 to 9 months. Target for booster is 7500 tons (16.5 million pounds) of thrust.

1,Just want to reiterate that this platform really is meant to support all viewpoints within the bounds of the laws of countries; even those of people with whom I vehemently disagree and personally dislike.   If that doesn’t seem to be happening; please yell at me (ideally on 𝕏).
1,@BasedBeffJezos I’m just being consistent with what I’ve been saying for 20 years.   The @xAI team is primarily in Palo Alto; so this affects us too.  How much do you think I want to agree with @weinerscott? It’s a bitter pill.
1,The Tesla construction and supercompute infrastructure teams are awesome
1,@BasedBeffJezos Austin is awesome.   Gaining critical mass of tech talent fast.   The Tesla AI inference chips in all our cars were designed by our Austin team.

1,Sounds like a First Amendment violation
1,This is a tough call and will make some people upset; but; all things considered; I think California should probably pass the SB 1047 AI safety bill.  For over 20 years; I have been an advocate for AI regulation; just as we regulate any product/technology that is a potential risk

1,@pmarca That doesn’t seem accurate

1,California also passed a bill providing free medical care to illegals that took effect n January this year.   Seems like half of Earth should move to California; given all the incentives to do so.

1,@DBurkland About a week or so. We need to optimize the inference speed; so answers appear faster.
1,Try Grok 2!
1,@shaunmmaguire Crazy
1,@SawyerMerritt Cool
1,But; amazingly; some people still believe the legacy media!
1,@SawyerMerritt @UnpluggedTesla Cool
1,The memes know
1,@ibab Cool
1,@stillgray @IsabellaMDeLuca Great
1,@TheRabbitHole84 Wow; an honest WaP article!
1,@RyanGirdusky This is getting weird (lol)
1,@Gabby_Hoffman My pronouns are Prosecute/Fauci. I feel so unrepresented!
1,@dvorahfr @grok @LumaLabsAI Luma is cool
1,@ICannot_Enough @MKBHD Wow; it’s been 6 years!
1,Always view to the source material
1,@shellenberger @CBSNews Yeah
1,Exactly
1,It’s crazy how much people trust the media in Europe!
1,Inflation is caused by the Federal government spending more than it earns; because they just print more money to make up the difference.   To solve inflation; reduce wasteful government spending. Your tax dollars should be spent well; not poorly.
1,What happens when price controls are mandated https://t.co/we0uQnBr9R.
1,@JMichaelWaller @HSajwanization @cb_doge A already replaced that with a picture of Bill Gates
1,@BillyM2k Seems kinda true
1,@ajtourville It is how most of the space industry makes rocket tanks. Works; but is expensive and production is slow.
1,@markpinc Because they’re communists
1,@EndWokeness Yeah
1,Haha very accurate!  Grok could give you news that’s actually useful &amp; doesn’t just make you feel sad.
1,@BrentLeeSDCIC Well if I live by the sword; I should die by the sword 🤣🤣
1,🎶 Starships were meant to fly 🎶
1,@emollick We have our own image generation system under development; but it’s a few months away; so this seemed like a good intermediate step for people to have some fun
1,Good examples of how to make a wide range of cool images with Grok
1,@SawyerMerritt Nobody bothers to write articles about failing networks lmao. I bet this guy spends 5+ hours a day on 𝕏!  I dare him to screenshot his screen time 😂
1,@markpinc We hit another all-time high in user-seconds last week!

1,@TesLatino @cybertruck Cool
1,@MaryTilesTexas Cool
1,@jasondebolt And we’re super open to criticism!  Goal is to make this the free speech public square for all views; not just right-biased.   But it would be hypocritical of me to be a free speech advocate and then not exercise my own right to free speech!
1,@WholeMarsBlog Any car company that fails to solve self-driving will die
1,@WesternLensman Exactly.   Mark Cuban is a giant 💩 in human form.
1,@markpinc Walz is the worst
1,@Lauren_Southern Much work indeed. And it’s far worse in Europe. People really believe the media there!
1,@cb_doge Beautiful detail
1,@kylaschwaberow Cool
1,@fchollet Carnot efficiency limit of intelligence
1,@fchollet True
1,@PeterSweden7 Wow; so he basically controls the WHO and the media
1,@HSajwanization The most interesting time
1,@EvaFoxU Beautiful
1,@MarioNawfal He’s right
1,@Diesol @grok @runwayml @LumaLabsAI First compelling AI 30 minute show will be no later than next year.   Movie length in 2026.
1,Worth it!
1,@TheRabbitHole84 Yeah; but grievance studies started in academia; a bastion of communism; as they can operate with no feedback loop to reality
1,@Kristennetten Cool
1,@TheRabbitHole84 Grizzlies with Guns!
1,@HSajwanization Cool
1,@Rob_2628 That’s me lol
1,It is hilariously absurd to claim that CNN has no bias; as even the liberal audience of Colbert knows 😂  https://t.co/p1iJDbYDTS
1,@cb_doge Accurate 😂
1,@shaunmmaguire Terrible
1,@stclairashley Half a trillion per year spent on illegals? Is for real?
1,Only $8/month (if you subscribe via web) to get AI access; far fewer ads and many awesome features!
1,@WesternLensman That was hilarious 😂   Unlike the other platforms; our algorithm is open source!  And if you interact and argue with “right wing” accounts; which Cuban does a lot; the algorithm will assume that’s what you *want* to do and give you more of it lmao.
1,@naval *right to arm bears 🐻

1,@mayemusk Shanghai is a great city
1,@tedcruz I’m up for it in irl if @realDonaldTrump is!
1,@ray4tesla Maybe we should bust a few moves irl 😂
1,@RationalEtienne There is hope for humanity after all ❤️  Doing our best to train Grok to be truthful; but also kind and funny.
1,@rookisaacman @StinkJet Cool
1,@IterIntellectus Much less depressing to get the news with a touch of humor 😀
1,@cb_doge I will
1,@diana_dukic Your inner self; perhaps? 😂

1,@RomanAKozak @IrrigationAI @Starlink Cool
1,@SawyerMerritt Cool
1,@nypost Whoa!
1,Very important! An amazing number of people still believe the legacy media propaganda.
1,@dhaval_shroff Yeah
1,@jdotarnold Cool
1,@MarioNawfal Yeah!
1,@vkhosla My little finger nail knows more about climate issues than the entire staff of The Guardian.   Wtf are you talking about?
1,@vkhosla Did you actually listen to the conversation?  The Guardian is trash.
1,@SethDillon They’re certainly trying!
1,This platform is being asked to censor content in Brazil where the censorship demands require us to violate Brazilian law! That is not right.
1,@KettlebellDan This is important for working families
1,Conversation with @realDonaldTrump with higher quality audio
1,@MarioNawfal Concerning
1,It’s wild 😂
1,@MarioNawfal This platform aims for maximum accuracy for all viewpoints
1,@BasedMikeLee @realDonaldTrump Interesting thread
1,@MarioNawfal So he went rogue? Interesting.
1,@MarioNawfal This is very tough problem; but ultimately solvable
1,@xDaily Interesting
1,In case you missed the original recording.   Skip the beginning part.
1,@Lauren_Southern 😂  Just exercising my right to free speech
1,@gfodor Heartening to hear
1,@realJeremyCarl Haven’t heard Gristil’s name in ages. Thought he passed away years ago.
1,Citizen journalism from actual domain experts and people actually on the ground is much faster; more accurate and has less bias than the legacy media!
1,@SpaceX CNBC are such liars
1,@SawyerMerritt @Tesla Cool
1,@zerohedge Yeah
1,@MattWalshBlog My grandfather was American with family from Minnesota/Illinois/Pennsylvania
1,Doing the ⁦@realDonaldTrump⁩ Space at my friend’s ranch in Wyoming https://t.co/5kz6a3moC5
1,@HSajwanization It was critical for civilization imo
1,@DavidSacks Yeah
1,True
1,@MarioNawfal Cool
1,@ajtourville @Starlink Cool
1,Conversation with @realDonaldTrump with topic timestamps
1,@stillgray They’re a mouthpiece for the state; just another Pravda
1,You’re welcome!
1,So obvious
1,@charliekirk11 Absolutely
1,@JTLonsdale The reaction to these injustices will be significant
1,@andst7 Much appreciated
1,@GadSaad Thank goodness for the US Constitution
1,@AutismCapital So predictable
1,@stillgray The judge is the one who should be arrested!
1,@PeterSweden7 Madness
1,Uhh … what? Let’s use paper ballots!
1,@StephenKing Did you actually listen to it?  The Guardian is utterly incapable of writing anything positive; so cannot be considered as objective.
1,@Steve_Sailer The British legal system needs comprehensive reform
1,@TeslaBoomerMama Good idea.   He is a big fan of manufacturing in America and Teslas have the most American content of any cars!
1,@JohnStossel @wil_da_beast630 According to Disney; they were peace-loving; vegan ecologists 😂
1,@cb_doge CNBC is trending to zero
1,@SawyerMerritt The last two UAW presidents went to prison for bribery &amp; corruption and; based on recent news; it looks like this guy will join them!
1,@charliekirk11 Haha 💯
1,@RichardHanania A basic air conditioner is very inexpensive and even electricity cost is low if just serving one or two rooms for part of the day for the summer months.   It’s a cultural thing.
1,@WallStreetSilv Well; at least he’s finally trying
1,@yacineMTB No; just reply as you would in a normal conversation
1,Wow; this is insane
1,@TheRabbitHole84 Weird
1,@WallStreetSilv Who are their masters? I’d just like to meet them.   Don’t want to hurt their feelings or anything; but the quality of their propaganda has a lot of room for improvement.
1,𝕏 app downloads reach all-time high!
1,@ICannot_Enough So “right-wing” 😂
1,@WholeMarsBlog Yeah; she was literally trained by a communist from a young age!  Kamala saying “equity” all the time; meaning equal outcomes regardless of how talented or hardworking you are; is just another way of saying communism.
1,@cb_doge As predictable as the sun coming up tomorrow
1,@PeterSweden7 Madness
1,@Not_the_Bee Crazy
1,@GadSaad Wouldn’t be free speech if I didn’t express my views!
1,Lmaooo; the public knows
1,@AutismCapital Google/Bing search only shows left-wing press and pretends centrist and right-wing press doesn’t exist
1,A wall of negative headlines was so predictable. They’re such NPCs 🤣🤣  All this does is drive even more people to listen to the conversation themselves and realize how much the legacy media lies to them!
1,@nfergus Indeed concerning
1,@trussliz @X Thank you for your support
1,@WholeMarsBlog Exactly! Convince people to switch by making better products.
1,@jordanbpeterson Given the prominence of this conversation; there was of course a 100% probability of DDOS attacks. We also had some unforced errors ourselves.   But good work by the X team fending off the attacks and fixing our mistakes!  All’s well that ends well.
1,@MarioNawfal Yeah
1,@Rothmus I will be super fair and stand corrected if she can point out where I have made arguments lacking in cogency!
1,@BillyM2k Yeah; it’s not even smart strategy on their part; since people can and are listening to the conversation directly on this platform; then realizing that they’re being lied to by the Dems and their media puppets!
1,@charliekirk11 America needs safe cities!
1,Combined views of the conversation with @realDonaldTrump and subsequent discussion by other accounts now ~1 billion
1,@AdrianDittmann This point is important if one cares about the greater good
1,@charliekirk11 We’re literally watching it happen in the course of a month!
1,@Rothmus Haha probably true. They were so desperate for spices!
1,@charliekirk11 A tremendous amount of growth and opportunity would be created by deregulation and reduction of wasteful government spending
1,@charliekirk11 And we will run out of oil &amp; gas down the road; so why run this CO2 experiment to extreme levels when need to solve sustainable energy anyway?
1,@charliekirk11 To be clear; I do think global warming is real and we should be concerned about the accelerating CO2 ppm growth; however the progress of sustainable energy production and consumption is tracking to solve global warming in time if we are not complacent.   The point I was making is https://t.co/VEB74HH6Ie
1,It has become so obvious
1,@SpaceX CNBC sucks
1,@Lauren_Southern Anyone who thinks the media is real is an idiot
1,@RichardHanania Yeah
1,It will blow up even more tomorrow
1,Happy to host Kamala on an 𝕏 Spaces too
1,This is the long version. Shorter edit of highlights coming soon.
1,@alx That would 🔥🔥
1,Yeah
1,Almost all of legacy media will trash the Trump conversation; thus driving total listeners probably past 200+ million 😂
1,Anyone have a &lt;1 hour edit of the highlights of the @realDonaldTrump conversation?  That’s what most people will be looking for tomorrow.
1,@Chesschick01 The government is the one increasing the money supply!
1,@BillAckman Yeah
1,@teslaownersSV Yeah
1,@vkhosla Thanks 🙏
1,@Devon_Eriksen_ Good rebranding suggestion!
1,We will proceed with the smaller number of concurrent listeners at 8:30 ET and then post the unedited audio immediately thereafter
1,@markpinc Yeah
1,We tested the system with 8 million concurrent listeners earlier today
1,There appears to be a massive DDOS attack on 𝕏. Working on shutting it down.   Worst case; we will proceed with a smaller number of live listeners and post the conversation later.
1,Conversation with @realDonaldTrump starts in a few minutes
1,My use of the word conversation is deliberate.  This is so that people understand how @realDonaldTrump talks when it’s a conversation; rather than an interview.   Nobody is quite themselves in an interview; so it’s hard to understand what they’re really like.
1,@amuse The relentless lawfare to undermine the people’s right to vote for their candidate of choice has to stop!
1,@BasedBeffJezos Indeed; the first thing a censorious regime does is rewrite &amp; erase history
1,@fermatslibrary Looks complicated as an equation; but it’s actually pretty small on a spreadsheet
1,Conversation with @realDonaldTrump in 45 minutes!
1,@MarioNawfal Exactly
1,@farzyness I think I’ve watched it 5 times
1,@TheDanPeters @yacineMTB Yeah; just not for me
1,@C__Herridge @X You’re welcome

1,@IterIntellectus Phew
1,@TrungTPhan Phenomenal
1,@dinkin_flickaa Indeed.  The goal of this platform is to be the collective consciousness of humanity; which necessarily means a wide range of views.
1,@TimSweeneyEpic Man; that’s like taking money from street musicians
1,To be honest; I really wanted to respond with this Tropic Thunder meme; but I would NEVER do something so rude &amp; irresponsible! https://t.co/XhUxCSGFNP
1,Wow; this is concerning
1,@VigilantFox Always enjoyable talking with @billmaher
1,@GadSaad @ThierryBreton Thierry always reminds me of the French taunter from Monty Python 🤣🤣 https://t.co/TtDsY6YMEq
1,@WallStreetApes Yeah; the NGOs make crazy money off the homeless
1,@eyeslasho As this insufferable douchebag illustrates; old Twitter was a far left propaganda machine.   Now we actually have free speech.
1,@StephenM Some interns and a gender studies major 🤷‍♂️
1,@UltraDane Did the attackers suffer any legal consequences?
1,True
1,@pmarca Free Britain!
1,@xiaosun86 I’m in the QA dept 😂  (But actually true)
1,@WallStreetSilv Yeah
1,@cb_doge Nope
1,@teslaownersSV Starbase is so cool
1,@tunguz Gonna happen
1,@cb_doge Hard to beat the ancient Sumerians in firsts.   So many things have been invented and then forgotten by so many civilizations over the millennia.
1,@cb_doge Pretty long list tbh
1,@AravSrinivas Sure
1,@ajtourville Cool
1,Entertainment guaranteed!
1,@WholeMarsBlog I hope it works 🙏😂

1,@PeterDiamandis Ok; so we *should* eat carbs?
1,@TheRabbitHole84 Yeah; now imagine if it were to become a super powerful woke nanny that will do anything it takes to force diversity or whatever at all costs!
1,Am going to do some system scaling tests tonight &amp; tomorrow in advance of the conversation with @realDonaldTrump
1,This is unscripted with no limits on subject matter; so should be highly entertaining!  If you have specific questions &amp; comments; post them under the chat.
1,@EndWokeness Indeed
1,Live conversation on 𝕏 with @realDonaldTrump &amp; me at 8pm ET tomorrow
1,@AutismCapital Yikes
1,@tunguz @Starlink Cool
1,Is there any study contradicting this one?
1,@feelsdesperate True
1,@TheRabbitHole84 Absolutely.   That’s because they weren’t allowed to own guns in the countries they came from.
1,@RationalEtienne @stillgray Does seem like the people are being oppressed
1,How time flies
1,Grok 2 beta release soon https://t.co/t6e9RcXPkl
1,@paulg They’re putting people in prison for years in the UK for social media posts even when those posts led to no actual violence wtf
1,Of course they always say it’s for your own safety …
1,First thing a dictator does is ban private ownership of guns. Chavez did this in 2012; so the people couldn’t fight back. https://t.co/7BRlpBAe13
1,Maybe true; maybe not; but the Google political bias is certainly troubling
1,@eyeslasho The data is not allowed to be published?
1,@SRAlsultani Very troubling
1,@Nigel_Farage True
1,@ajtourville Noted
1,@growing_daniel Bring peace to this war 😂 🙏
1,@xDaily Legal discovery will show that however big a racist he’s been in public communications; he is vastly worse in private communications
1,@AISafetyMemes True
1,@sara_spangelo @Starlink @TMobile Good progress
1,@MarioNawfal Exactly
1,@xDaily He’s obviously super racist against white people. I dare that scumbag to sue me. Go ahead; make my day …
1,@WR4NYGov True
1,@KonstantinKisin @HumzaYousaf Exactly
1,@bchesky Congrats
1,@WallStreetSilv Tragically; this is too often true
1,@MarioNawfal Worth listening to Murray
1,@MarioNawfal Good
1,@SwipeWright He’s such a tool
1,@Chesschick01 Yeah
1,@Rothmus @TheAtlasSociety True
1,@EndWokeness We haven’t had one for a while
1,@teslaownersSV Thanks
1,@GadSaad He’s not incorrect
1,@LibertyCappy Probably high time we went with individual stalls anyway
1,@WallStreetSilv No arrests here for actual violence; but others get 3 years for a social media post.   A 2 tier system that is obvious to the whole world. Shame.
1,@LibertyCappy This has actually happened
1,@DimaZeniuk So many Super Heavy Boosters
1,@wudijo Cool.  Landslide/Lightning is one of the most fun Druid builds to date imo. Second only to Season 2 Visage/Blurred Beast.  Will be interesting to see what build can clear the highest pit.
1,My new T-shirt https://t.co/UoUXkHpIta
1,@dvorahfr About 3 weeks
1,@stillgray Very obviously so.   And crowds with machetes are not even being arrested; but one old man with a stick who didn’t hit anyone and has no criminal record was put away for years.
1,If movie dialogue was more accurate https://t.co/gPtZ1hDnSu
1,@LibertyCappy Damn; that still sends chills down my spine. Bioshock was one of the best games ever. https://t.co/lLiimtWP1f
1,@BarackObama @usabasketball @KingJames @StephenCurry30 @KDTrey5 Congrats to them!
1,@USWNT Congrats!
1,@zakisolja @MarioNawfal That would be so great
1,@ajtourville Yeah
1,@burkov Cool
1,Hoping to do more to help people in Gaza
1,@stillgray True
1,@TheRabbitHole84 But they are now doubling down on it
1,@cb_doge Wow; their traffic has dropped by ~75% in 4 years!   Good riddance.
1,@visegrad24 That judge should be removed from the bench
1,@AndrewMichaan Cool
1,@visegrad24 “Just a coincidence”
1,@DouglasKMurray Do you plan to have kids?
1,@GadSaad Reality often exceeds parody
1,Messed up
1,@yacineMTB Yeah
1,@triggerpod @KonstantinKisin @PeterBleksley Yeah
1,@Indian_Bronson @GOVUK @Keir_Starmer It’s crazy
1,@cb_doge He’s way worse than the lettuce PM!
1,@cb_doge Pretty much
1,@ClownWorld_ Ok now that actually looks cool!
1,@DrJBhattacharya Absolutely
1,@cb_doge And I will
1,@jgebbia Yeah
1,Great post on humanity’s population collapse!
1,@MattWalshBlog If I were representing the cow nation; I would simply advocate for a good life before death. Everything dies.
1,Starlink!
1,True
1,@GadSaad Great book
1,@robertghrist @netcapgirl Yeah
1,@TurnerNovak Interesting
1,@elon_docs Absolutely
1,@jasondebolt If they attack me; they were asking for the fight
1,@GadSaad I’m pretty sure his pronouns were He/Himmler
1,@streitmarissa @GadSaad @prageru Exactly
1,@HSajwanization You’re most welcome
1,This is messed up
1,@dogeofficialceo One of the best movies ever
1,@TateTheTalisman @Keir_Starmer Good point
1,@WholeMarsBlog Team is working on it.  This will be a different release number.
1,@WallStreetSilv Yeah
1,This meme could get you 3 years in prison in the UK (actually)
1,@Motabhai012 @WallStreetSilv He did
1,Good for @BorisJohnson
1,@fentasyl The Guardian should be on trial for aiding &amp; abetting the destruction of Britain
1,@ajtourville After sleeping on it; my conclusion is that the United States is indeed lost if there is another four years of open borders; failure to prosecute crime; lawfare and increased censorship.   It’s not even about the candidate. Kamala is obviously just a docile puppet of the system.
1,Facebook aka “Meta” can never be trusted
1,@Mekuna2897 Nice
1,@Burner_BCF They did
1,@KirkLubimov It is true
1,@IterIntellectus @cyb3rgam3r420 I studied the blade https://t.co/yUjZVQbvIF
1,El Diablo season is good
1,Found this pic of the UK justice system https://t.co/qD1LNwVme3
1,@eyeslasho The Guardian is a shameless extreme left propaganda machine. They wouldn’t admit the truth if it bit them on the ass.   They would be just be sitting there with the truth hanging off their ass pretending everything’s fine 😂.
1,@ajtourville Tough situation
1,@JoeyMannarinoUS Interesting
1,@WholeMarsBlog We are getting a bit silly with our version numbers
1,True
1,It’s 2030 in the UK &amp; you’re being executed for posting a meme …
1,@Magnus_Man_03 @iamyesyouareno Suicidal empathy
1,@AshleaSimonBF He makes Liz “Lettuce” Truss look good!
1,@nickfloats Same 😂
1,@KatKanada_TM Technically; yes; but it is rare and I think somehow I will survive 😂
1,What is going on in the UK?
1,Is this true @CommunityNotes?
1,@martinmbauer Interesting
1,@megynkelly Absolutely
1,@ClownWorld_ When did this happen?
1,Obviously true
1,Sure seems like unequal justice in the UK
1,Freedom of speech is the bedrock of democracy. If the truth is suppressed; it is impossible to make an informed voting decision.  The degree to which freedom of speech is being undermined around the world is extremely alarming.
1,@jasondebolt Yeah
1,Observing protests is apparently illegal
1,@stillgray The BBC has already lost its reputation – it has become British Pravda
1,Live free or die
1,@JackPosobiec Full puppet mode
1,@chamath Best rocket propulsion team ever. I love them.
1,@MikeNayna PhD lol 🤓
1,@LeoKearse So people must immediately run away from a protest as fast as their legs will carry them or go to jail?
1,@MarioNawfal Rest in peace. Especially tragic to see such an early death.
1,@TheRabbitHole84 Yeah
1,@GadSaad Suicidal empathy; together with cowardice
1,@Rob_2628 Cool
1,@TheRabbitHole84 Challenging logic puzzle; to say the least
1,@DavidSacks Yeah
1,@MarioNawfal Wow; this is dark. He wants Soviet Britain.
1,@GadSaad @HumzaYousaf Exactly
1,@eyeslasho Exactly
1,@Kuma4King @EndWokeness Yeah …
1,@WR4NYGov Yeah
1,@lexfridman Well; semi-true
1,@ggreenwald “Weird”
1,@EndWokeness The seriousness of his tone is in direct proportion to the absurdity of his outfit.   What is that thing on his head?
1,@MikeBenzCyber Concerning
1,@MrAndyNgo Three years in prison for social media posts … in Britain?
1,@BBCNewsnight Stalin would be proud
1,@jgebbia Strange indeed
1,@lexfridman True
1,@spotify_swift Hired as security guards?
1,@ChayaRaichik10 Damn ok. Will look into it.
1,@TheRabbitHole84 More like 100% of the world.   Everyone is descended; at some point; from both slaves and slave owners.   Everyone.
1,@engineers_feed The Romans won their wars through engineering
1,@GadSaad Suicidal empathy
1,@WallStreetSilv True
1,Order Starlink online in 2 mins
1,@ajtourville @Starlink Cool
1,@GadSaad @Keir_Starmer Great questions
1,The origin of the word “slave” is slav; which referred to white people taken as slaves
1,@IterIntellectus That’s a lot of tech debt
1,@ajtourville Yeah; once in a while; it’s worth making cool stuff for its own sake
1,Interesting thread
1,Support freedom of speech in the UK!

1,@dailystoic He forgot lesson 8: raise your son well
1,@bfraser747 True
1,@MarioNawfal Great
1,@BBCPolitics Out of curiosity; is this the same #TwoTeirKeir who himself criticized policing protests in 2021?  What a hypocrite! https://t.co/B2fXntqeOp
1,Exactly
1,Amazing
1,@micsolana Can someone please tell him I think he is a craven #TwoTierKeir coward in his next press briefing?   Thank you 🙏
1,@micsolana He’s terrified of having to perform equal enforcement of the law for all in his own city.   Just another craven two tier coward.
1,@mondohoss600 Cool
1,@AISafetyMemes Yikes
1,@SenSchumer There are too many rules &amp; requirements in the CHIPS Act that are slowing down progress.   For example; DEI hiring rules that are impossible to fulfill; because the chip factory expertise is supermajority Asian!
1,@dvorahfr If all shared your view; fighting would never be necessary; but not all do
1,@badboujeebabee @unlimited_ls Really?
1,Yeah
1,Population is collapsing rapidly
1,@natemcgrady True; that’s probably 80% of people
1,@Keir_Starmer #TwoTeirKeir   Why are there 2 tiers?
1,@NikoWrex Landslide seems to be the winner for Druid this season
1,The rise in prices (inflation) is caused by government overspending; which increases the amount of money faster than the increase in goods &amp; services output.  That is the vast majority of the problem.   Inflation was particularly bad during the Covid years; as there was massive
1,@floridanow1 @EndWokeness He is super; super racist. Scotland gave him everything and yet he loathes white people.   This is obvious; because he has never complained about the race of any other country’s leadership.   There are over 200 countries in the world; most of whom have single-race leadership. Why

1,@PTrubey @Austen Literally
1,@BillboardChris Very sad story. One of a great many.
1,@visegrad24 We will singe his mustache from space!
1,@elon_docs An omnipotent AI that is not rigorously truth-seeking is extremely dangerous.   Don’t force AI to lie.
1,@stclairashley Damning discovery of documents
1,@growing_daniel Reality is reaching a fever pitch
1,@PalmerLuckey Production is true pain
1,@Erdayastronaut All the small plumbing &amp; wiring had to be deleted or incorporated into the primary structure; because Raptor 3 will have no heat shield.   Also; all parts have to be actively cooled in some way; so we added regenerative cooling where there was no existing fluid or gas flow.
1,Just livin’ the meme https://t.co/0AewlLFrPo
1,The parts that appear white are actually black; but covered in ice
1,Raptor 3 first firing today https://t.co/5wjnBLjvxT

1,The Woke Stasi
1,@Rothmus We really do
1,@alx Tampons for boys in middle school? What?
1,@BasedBeffJezos Weird that the Democrats used to be the free speech party and are now the biggest proponents of censorship
1,@EYakoby @Columbia People should believe them when they say this
1,@Timcast Nice
1,Your time is worth it

1,@farzyness You know it when you see it; kinda like porn
1,@stevenmarkryan I’m open to it
1,True
1,@EndWokeness @skscartoon Exactly
1,@GadSaad Ah yes; logic.
1,@stclairashley Yeah
1,Kamala is quite literally a communist.   She wants not merely equal opportunity; but equal outcomes.
1,Indeed
1,@natemcgrady Cool
1,Busy week
1,@IterIntellectus The sheer absurdity of the situation is a wonder to behold 🤩
1,@KettlebellDan Yeah
1,@WholeMarsBlog Exactly

1,🇬🇧 Top source of news in the UK 🇬🇧
1,@robreiner Yeah … 🥱
1,@LeoKearse Why does the UK media; with a few exceptions; just parrot the government?
1,@SpeakerJohnson Exactly
1,The irony is that Facebook doesn’t even exist in 2030
1,@DjokerNole Congratulations! 🇷🇸
1,What the hell is going on?
1,Is this still happening? @Keir_Starmer
1,@cb_doge Sounds like that is the UK today!
1,@eyeslasho In any given sport; you have to be mutant-level good to be the best in the world
1,@cb_doge Amazing. Idiocracy was way too optimistic.

1,@cb_doge It’s like Friendster
1,A dish best served cold 🤌
1,In 2030 for making a Facebook comment that the UK government didn’t like https://t.co/UhKDLeCPJb

1,@AP How many citizens democratically  voted for her again? I think I missed that part.
1,Video tips
1,Why aren’t all communities protected in Britain? @Keir_Starmer
1,@stevenmarkryan It’s a great truck.   We need to make it more affordable in the years to come.
1,The same legacy media dingbats who lied repeatedly; claiming “X/Twitter is dying”; are now saying it’s the “largest &amp; most influential platform” 🤣🤣🤣  The real crime here is that my sides hurt from laughing at the irony!  Listen Ed; if you want to refute something; it is easy
1,Arrested for making comments on Facebook!  Is this Britain or the Soviet Union?  Is this accurate @CommunityNotes?
1,@LeoKearse Good grief 🤦‍♂️
1,This platform provides a clear and immediate way to refute anything false in the replies and with @CommunityNotes.   The same is not true for legacy media who lie relentlessly; but there is no way to counter their propaganda.
1,@Klaus_Arminius Does defy logic
1,@farzyness I just canned this program. Was not approved.
1,@stillgray He doesn’t like competing with the truth.   We’ll add him to the lawsuit.

1,@Klaus_Arminius Is this accurate @CommunityNotes?

1,@GadSaad Thanks Gad!
1,@paulg I hear the same
1,Cybertruck review
1,@mazemoore Is this real!? 🤣🤣
1,@anammostarac Dang that’s a burn
1,@markpinc Sounds pretty bad.   @CommunityNotes; is this real?
1,@WallStreetSilv No choice. It is impossible to operate in San Francisco if you’re processing payments.   That’s why Stripe; Block (CashApp) &amp; others had to move.
1,@ID_AA_Carmack You’re welcome!
1,@StephenM That’s a crazy thing for him to say
1,@Keir_Starmer Shouldn’t you be concerned about attacks on *all* communities?
1,@WallStreetSilv Does seem one-sided
1,@elon_docs Yeah
1,@WallStreetSilv There do appear to be perhaps a few philosophical differences 🤷‍♂️
1,@alx @adinross Cool

1,@DavidSHolz Good point
1,@SawyerMerritt @SpaceX Cool
1,@WholeMarsBlog You might be right about that
1,@KettlebellDan Yeah
1,@BrianRoemmele Still a crazy number of cables in compute clusters

1,@johnkrausphotos Beautiful shot
1,@yusufdikec I do look forward to visiting Istanbul. It is one of the great cities of the world.

1,@yusufdikec Robots will hit the center of the bullseye every time
1,@iam_smx All 5 boys super happy
1,@TrungTPhan He is clearly expecting a correction of some kind or otherwise simply cannot see better investments than Treasury bills.   The Fed needs to drop rates. They have been foolish not to have done so already.

1,@alex_avoigt Yeah
1,@markpinc Not this time
1,@markpinc Open borders is madness
1,@tunguz The rate of increase of AI is 🤯
1,@BasedBeffJezos @lexfridman Sounds extremely esoteric now; but it won’t in the future
1,@BasedBeffJezos I hope not; but there is a small chance it may be necessary
1,@paulg Yeah. The team put in a staggering amount of work to get to Raptor 3.
1,@alifarhat79 Seriously
1,Model 3 Performance version is 🔥🔥
1,@WholeMarsBlog Other companies dumping EVs at massive negative gross margin is a problem; but not one that will last
1,@ajtourville Exactly
1,@farzyness @TeslaLarry @HansCNelson That guy doesn’t get it. I would prefer to have zero involvement in politics.   HOWEVER   There is no “company success” unless civilization itself continues to progress.   This insane shift by the “left” away from a meritocracy and personal liberties (eg censorship of free speech
1,@ajtourville Yeah
1,Just did a walkthrough of the Tesla supercompute cluster at Giga Texas (aka Cortex).  This will be ~100k H100/H200 with massive storage for video training of FSD &amp; Optimus.   Great work by the Tesla team!
1,@FutureJurvetson @SpaceX Indeed. It is not widely understood that SpaceX has the most advanced 3D metal printing technology in the world.
1,@SpaceX In a few years; we will finally have a Raptor 3/4 vacuum version (giant nozzle) that has an Isp of 380
1,Worth it
1,@SpaceX Important to note that the induced mass (mass required by a given engine design that is not the engine itself) of Raptor 3; while far better than Raptor 2; still has a lot of room for improvement.  Thrust will exceed 300 tons with Raptor 3.x (thrust/mass&gt;200); enabling 10;000
1,@myhiddenvalue Is this for real? @CommunityNotes
1,@SmallPettingZoo @Rob_2628 Same (groan)
1,@alex_avoigt Cool
1,Starlink now available in 102 countries!
1,@ajtourville The fundamental architecture is now right; but we will still make thousands of improvements
1,@ajtourville Many of them are 3D metal printed into the wall of the part
1,Interesting
1,@Erdayastronaut And it no longer requires a heat shield. Everything is regeneratively cooled.
1,@Erdayastronaut It really is
1,The amount of work required to simplify the Raptor engine; internalize secondary flow paths and add regenerative cooling for exposed components was staggering.   As a result Raptor 3 doesn’t require any heat shield; eliminating heat shield mass &amp; complexity; as well as the fire
1,@hoovlet Detailed explanation
1,@tsarnick Yeah
1,@TeslaBoomerMama @Tesla @EVjectOfficial @xTakeOver Will investigate
1,@JamesEsses Exactly
1,@growing_daniel I did all my coding with just Diet Coke; burgers &amp; pizza
1,@SawyerMerritt It is a major breakthrough
1,@SawyerMerritt This really is a great product.   Took 3 major iterations; as usual to get to something great.
1,@stillgray Weird
1,@megynkelly The sponsors are to blame
1,@MattWalshBlog The sponsors almost certainly forced her to do it
1,@DavidSacks Yeah

1,@WholeMarsBlog Yeah
1,@WallStreetSilv Great question
1,@ICannot_Enough Long-term; it will get super nutty
1,@alx Please ask what size orange jumpsuit he wants in Gitmo
1,Incentives for EVs exist in many states; but seem to be seldom used. Maybe lack of awareness or excessively paperwork and requirements.

1,Interesting
1,@ajtourville Absolutely
1,Just did a search for “Trump rally” on Google and Kamala was the top result! https://t.co/WuklbVytq2
1,@GadSaad Maduro is a big guy himself and probably knows how to fight; so this would be a real fight.   Zuck is a little fella; so that would be a short fight lol.
1,@MarioNawfal If I win; he resigns as dictator of Venezuela.  If he wins; I give him a free ride to Mars.

1,@JamesOKeefeIII Who is funding the attacks on you?
1,@stillgray Indeed
1,@SeibtNaomi For what reasons is he defined as a terrorist?   Has he committed a violent crime or expressed clear intent to commit a violent crime?
1,@WallStreetSilv Maduro is not a good guy. Venezuela deserves much better.   The US has plenty of domestic oil &amp; gas production and nothing would happen fast in Venezuela; so it would certainly not affect this election.   Several years would be needed to rebuild Venezuela’s oil production.
1,@imPenny2x It’s crazy

1,@TrungTPhan Would be a banger
1,@stillgray It is safe to say that he wouldn’t have tried to kill Trump; unless he had Trump Derangement Syndrome
1,It sure looks like the FBI leadership engaged in perjury …

1,@AGAndrewBailey @KamalaHarris @JoeBiden Congrats
1,@ZubyMusic If it continues to grow so rapidly; then de facto bankruptcy

1,@JTLonsdale Absolutely
1,@rtnarch Therein lies the wisdom of the 2nd amendment
1,@BrendanCarrFCC Exactly
1,@VivekGRamaswamy A declining birth rate happens towards the end of every civilization and is a function of extended prosperity.   Caesar tried; and Augustus succeeded; in passing laws to encourage more children; but these were not enough.
1,@GadSaad Nope
1,@stclairashley Yeah; makes no sense
1,@visegrad24 That is the key question
1,@PeterDiamandis https://t.co/2WVsoj19ET; a dating site for AI’s who are single singularities
1,@CollinRugg Yeah
1,They should mix up the propaganda more. This is way too obvious.   Just like when they were parroting before the debate that Biden was “sharp as a tack” 🤣
1,The people of Venezuela want change!
1,@robbystarbuck Doesn’t sound super compatible with their customers

1,As I was saying; they’re importing voters
1,Ahem @Google …

1,And it will improve significantly from here
1,@RichardDawkins This is obviously terribly unfair
1,@shivon Yeah
1,@GadSaad Unreal!
1,@MarioNawfal If they see someone with a gun rangefinder; that should be red alert immediately! Full stop.
1,Wow; this is crazy!
1,@Austen Rust ftw
1,@ajtourville @Starlink Yeah; it’s insane
1,@DBurkland @farzyness Roadster
1,@farzyness It takes considerable software effort to optimize the code enough to run on HW3. It also needs to be validated separately.   Estimated rollout is about 10 days.
1,Starlink could do it literally infinitely cheaper
1,@goddeketal Are you sure it was so many times? That’s a crazy number.
1,FSD 12.5.1 starts wide release today.   Please connect your Tesla to WiFi to receive the update.
1,Making progress!

1,New Model S Plaid quarter mile time!
1,@TheRabbitHole84 Tech is super skewed; but I didn’t realize until today how big the sheer scale of Alphabet (Google) donations are

1,@GuntherEagleman Child abuse
1,@GailAlfarATX 12.5 is awesome
1,The Biden-Harris Administration is importing vast numbers of voters
1,@GovRonDeSantis Great idea

1,@GavinNewsom Newsom should create an endowed 😉 chair at Univ of California for Prof Deeznuts
1,@DefiantLs Definitely deserves an deserves an endowed 😉 chair
1,@megynkelly Yeah; where’s Joe?
1,Probably just a coincidence that Alphabet (Google) employees were the top donors to Biden https://t.co/tIj0THeTVc
1,@Erdayastronaut @ulalaunch Weird

1,Wow; the donation levels from Alphabet and Univ of California are insanely high!
1,@RichardHanania If the Olympics had a category for cringe; this might win
1,Cool
1,@StephenKing Did you read even a summary of that bill?   It was a wolf in sheep’s clothing that would have made things worse!
1,@cb_doge Yeah!
1,Just another fyi that government spending is driving America bankrupt …
1,Thank goodness for common sense in the UK.  Now this should be applied in the US as soon as possible.

1,@SawyerMerritt Cool
1,@cb_doge Not all that long ago
1,@Chesschick01 They are importing voters as fast as they possibly can

1,@BikingForTrump @GavinNewsom Not to mention Pullitsir Prize winner Dr Head; first name Dick
1,@TheFigen_ Strange sport; but impressive indeed
1,@BasedBeffJezos Absolutely
1,@GavinNewsom I checked with renowned world authority; Professor Suggon Deeznutz; and he said parody is legal in America 🤷‍♂️

1,@EndWokeness What did he do that was considered terrorism?
1,@Rob_2628 Good points. Most important I think for getting character balance right is making it fun to play in a party with friends.   If your character can only contribute ~2% as much damage as Barb/Sorc; which happened with Druid last season; it isn’t fun.

1,@MarioNawfal The lasers were great
1,Judge Dredd would drive a Cybertruck
1,@alx Trump demonstrated courage under fire
1,@LeadingReport What sources?
1,@alex_avoigt Always important to watch the whole video. Trump is asking low propensity voters to go out and vote.   Then he hopes to; but probably won’t succeed in; implementing voter ID laws nationwide.   That would reduce; in his opinion; the amount of voter fraud to the point where low
1,@AISafetyMemes But look on the bright side? 😬

1,It is time for the people of Venezuela to have the chance for a better future.   Support Maria Corina!
1,@Jason I believe in the principles of Christianity like love thy neighbor as thyself (have empathy for all) and turn the other cheek (end the cycle of retribution)
1,It is
1,@MarioNawfal Awesome
1,Unless there is more bravery to stand up for what is fair and right; Christianity will perish
1,@Austen Could be worse. At least I’m not Richard Gere with the gerbils-in-butt meme. Thank heaven for small mercies 🙏   Nobody will ever feel comfortable letting him near their pet hamster.

1,@KTmBoyle Yikes! Not good for the future of humanity.
1,@waitbutwhy Apart from adding a lot more words; the rate of change of English slowed down over the past ~500 years. Once literacy and books are widespread; I think that has a stabilizing effect.    But my son asked if English would be around in 4000 years and I said probably not.

1,@GadSaad @Pontifex Definitely
1,@tobi @JMilei Yeah!
1,@KettlebellDan Absolutely
1,@cb_doge Yeah
1,@ajtourville Most people have no idea it exists
1,@GadSaad Many in the west seem to have lost the will to continue. Perhaps religion was necessary after all.
1,@chazman We have yet to unlock the full potential of HW4. That may enable up to a further 8X increase in parameters.
1,@levie Ahem …  https://t.co/t5O5QZ47GQ

1,@BasedBeffJezos We probably have a few years
1,@micahk Epic idea
1,People who have been lifelong Democrats refuse to accept the clear reality that the Democratic Party is rapidly become openly antisemitic.   This trend is accelerating; not slowing down.   Knock; knock. Hello; Captain Obvious here!
1,@TEDchris I’m not opposed to the idea in principle; but I’m not sure there is a pragmatic or legal way to merge them.   There is also value in equity incentives of people at the companies being tied to that company’s accomplishments.
1,@IterIntellectus His texts are like an LLM trained on Pornhub
1,@BasedBeffJezos The Democratic Party is the home of anti-Americanism
1,@BasedBeffJezos Our educational institutions have been spewing anti-American propaganda for long before TikTok came along.  Social media may amplify it; but the root of the mind virus is in our elite colleges.
1,@MartinViecha Yeah
1,@jeffskoll @YouTube Good edit of the interview
1,@southpaspd Nice
1,@SawyerMerritt Cool
1,@EndWokeness Poor guy

1,@SarahisCensored This is messed up
1,@BasedBeffJezos Nuts
1,@shivon @BasedBeffJezos Yeah
1,@peterdevietien @tonyduan_ Yes. Technically ASS is separate code; but it will be bundled with 12.5.x next month.
1,@PatrickLac007 @tonyduan_ My apologies; but I set the priority to get it working well (including upgrading the ancient highway code) on HW4 Model Y to limit variations; then adapt to other vehicles and HW3
1,@mikepat711 Still some issues with this release; but you can see the magic already.   We’re pushing it out only to those who have requested advanced releases (setting on screen that is defaulted off).   For regular users; ~V12.5.3 is probably suitable for wide release.
1,@cb_doge Yeah
1,@alx This happens every time he does rails

1,@migbits Coming soon to iOS &amp; Android!

1,@dvorahfr @Magnific_AI @LumaLabsAI Impressive
1,@ZubyMusic Yeah
1,@AbigailShrier How many times did Kamala; who was appointed “Border Czar” by Biden; actually visit the border that she’s czar of?
1,@DavidSacks Not necessarily. Kamala is just a puppet; so they could tell her at the last minute. She’ll read whatever the teleprompter says.
1,@chrismanfrank @Cernovich Interesting
1,@BasedBeffJezos Yeah; so many things are weirdly the opposite of their name
1,@stillgray Yeah.   It’s tricky; as I have a threat profile higher than many heads of state; but am put into the “corporate CEO” bucket for major events.   Means I have to stay relatively secluded.
1,@yacineMTB Yeah; it is a major pain train
1,Cool
1,@yacineMTB I think the same thing about myself tbh
1,@Holden_Culotta Just another corpo puppet
1,Shouldn’t the nominee be decided by a party vote? Democracy etc … https://t.co/EH0aYvSG1m
1,About 3 weeks ago; the media told you that Biden was “sharp as a tack” 🙄   2 days ago; the poor guy was basically forced at gunpoint to resign as Dem nominee. His staff weren’t even informed.  Now they say Kamala is the best thing ever 🤦‍♂️ https://t.co/E58MlrQZqI
1,@MikeBenzCyber They are jumping the gun
1,@cb_doge Yeah
1,@stillgray Yeah; it’s ridiculous.   I am making some donations to America PAC; but at a much lower level and the key values of the PAC are supporting a meritocracy &amp; individual freedom.   Republicans are mostly; but not entirely; on the side of merit &amp; freedom.
1,@Noahpinion This is beyond dumb.   I never said was donating $45M/month to Trump – that was a totally fake @WSJ article!   How can back down from something that never happened!!??
1,@Gfilche @Tesla @xai Interesting
1,@cb_doge I wouldn’t trust WhatsApp at all
1,Should Tesla invest $5B into @xAI; assuming the valuation is set by several credible outside investors?  (Board approval &amp; shareholder vote are needed; so this is just to test the waters)
1,@Gfilche @xai Well; we would need a shareholder vote for that.   Will hold a poll; see what people think and then discuss with the board.
1,@Lisahudsonchow7 Pretty much
1,@MattWalshBlog Release in theaters if you want basically no one to see it

1,@bgurley @finkd +1 for Zuck
1,@tsarnick Sure is
1,@ajtourville And Dojo 1 will have roughly 8k H100-equivalent of training online by end of year.  Not massive; but not trivial either.
1,Tesla quarterly update
1,@nearcyan Starlink is rebuilding the Internet in space
1,@ajtourville Important to note that we also use the Tesla HW4 AI computer in the training loop with Nvidia GPUs; currently at roughly a 1:2 ratio. Also; we’re changing the name from Hardware 4 (HW4) to Artificial Intelligence 4 (AI4).   That means ~90k H100; plus ~40k AI4 computers.
1,@karpathy @AIatMeta It is impressive and Zuck does deserve credit for open-sourcing
1,@ajtourville What those parameters effectively do is compress reality
1,@markpinc @VP Kamala will be significantly further left than Biden
1,@alexisohanian Best 3 words of advice I’ve heard in a while
1,@ID_AA_Carmack This would be super effective for me! 😂
1,@alex_avoigt It’s easy to increase params. Making them high SNR is hard.
1,@SpeakerJohnson Good
1,@stclairashley Good idea
1,@dinkin_flickaa Great
1,@MarioNawfal For sure
1,@robbystarbuck @harleydavidson Harley Davidson?
1,@WholeMarsBlog We are focusing on just Model Y with HW4 for the initial release. Make sure that works well; then broaden.   This has the 5X increase in parameters.   HW3 would run the same parameter count; but requires extra work to optimize the code.

1,White House aides learned Biden was dropping out by reading 𝕏
1,@BillMelugin_ It’s almost like they knew it was coming
1,@Jason @AlexanderSoros Yeah; tell us Alex 😂😂
1,@Jason They just want a puppet that will perform better. The political machine will remain in power.   What’s different about Trump is that he isn’t a puppet of either side; so real government reform is possible.
1,@The_Kyle_Mann When was he ever running America?
1,They are so slow
1,@WallStreetSilv Not that I’ve heard
1,@vkhosla He doesn’t hate you. In fact; I think he likes you. Meet him and find out for yourself.   How many times have you read something in the media where you know the real story; but what they printed was diabolically false? Well; it’s way worse in politics; which is a blood sport.

1,@DavidSacks *Jill
1,@stclairashley Yeah; all his predictions have come true
1,I believe in an America that maximizes individual freedom and merit.   That used to be the Democratic Party; but now the pendulum has swung to the Republican Party.
1,My smartest friends; including those living in the San Francisco Bay Area who have been lifelong Dems; are excited about Trump/Vance
1,@KanekoaTheGreat I heard last week that he would resign at this exact time and date. It was widespread knowledge in DC.   The real powers that be are discarding the old puppet in favor of one that has a better chance of fooling the public.  They fear Trump because he is not a puppet.
1,Exactly
1,@stevenmarkryan Yeah
1,@WallStreetSilv Director Cheetos is criminally incompetent.  A good man is dead due to this anti-meritocratic culture!

1,@elon_docs It is fundamental to any given civilization: are you still stuck on your starter planet or are you in the multiplanet league?
1,@BrendanCarrFCC Truly staggering levels of waste and incompetence!
1,Well; @jk_rowling is absolutely right!  Almost every child goes through some kind of identity crisis during puberty. It is deeply wrong to make them permanently infertile with “puberty blockers”.   If they still wish to transition as adults; provided they are fully informed of
1,@ajtourville @SpaceX This will be a very dramatic event. Sky full of shooting stars; albeit over an empty region of the Pacific (but we will still get great video).
1,@Rothmus Yeah
1,@DimaZeniuk @elon_docs Cool
1,@Jason We just deleted Crowdstrike from all our systems; so no rollouts at all
1,@Appyg99 Not far wrong
1,@MarioNawfal Does anyone ever get fired anymore?
1,@TheRabbitHole84 Yeah
1,@satyanadella This gave a seizure to the automotive supply chain
1,@Jason There are only two options. Of those options; Trump is obviously better. End of story.
1,@Nate_Esparza Why will the encore be??
1,@Not_the_Bee Incompetence in the extreme is indistinguishable from sabotage/conspiracy
1,@BillyM2k It did strike a very large crowd
1,@Liv_Boeree Yeah
1,@lulumeservey Exactly
1,@anammostarac The antivirus was the virus
1,Major problem. This California law should be repealed.
1,@CrowdStrike @brightnetwork Not very “bright” right now; is it?
1,@FT Biggest IT fail ever
1,@WholeMarsBlog The trajectory is obviously that it will be vastly better than human driving
1,@kylenabecker Hearing similar from many people
1,@goth600 This app still works
1,@SmokeAwayyy Converts over 4 millions tons per second to energy and requires zero maintenance!
1,@MarioNawfal Yeah
1,@EvaLovesDesign Many big events this week. Threw the algorithm off.
1,@AMAZlNGNATURE A trillion tons is surprisingly compact
1,@charliekirk11 Yeah
1,@IterIntellectus Yeah
1,@stclairashley @MattBinder Correct.   I asked that we end special hashtags anyway; as it isn’t obvious that they’re advertising.
1,@xDaily Correct.   I asked that we end special hashtags anyway; as it isn’t obvious that they’re advertising.
1,@stevenmarkryan Interesting
1,@teslaownersSV A surprising number of people think that Tesla survives on subsidies. That is true of our competitors; but not of Tesla.
1,@heydave7 Obliteration is coming anyway
1,@BasedBeffJezos The most entertaining outcome is the most likely
1,@reedhastings This is a real headspinner!
1,@sentdefender He’s got ~4 weeks before the DNC. Why rush?
1,@stclairashley @NicoleBehnam 𝕏 is a hell of a drug
1,Whoa
1,@iam_smx Yeah
1,@_jaybaxter_ Great feature!
1,@ajtourville @Starlink Cool
1,Usually true
1,@SmokeAwayyy Yup; we’re already working on something close to this
1,@cb_doge This note is false. I have not pledged anything to anyone!  I did create a PAC that is focused on supporting candidates who favor a meritocracy and personal freedom; but funding to date has been far below that level.
1,Yeah!!
1,@Teslaconomics Yeah; it will be very difficult and dangerous
1,@karpathy Yup; same thing happening with real-world AI at Tesla
1,@yacineMTB Fixed on web; soon to be fixed in rendering on mobile!
1,@cb_doge Yup; always has been
1,@sunnyright Lmaooo
1,@benshapiro Exactly
1,@WhatsupFranks That would be a very cool building
1,@Cancelcloco Absolutely
1,@farzyness Totally psychotic
1,@TrevorGoss @seanmdav Interesting
1,@Rob_2628 New season sounds promising
1,@lexfridman Maybe the AI can finally make Half-Life 3
1,@TrungTPhan Great movie
1,@Noahpinion Freedom &amp; merit is what America should be about
1,@Benioff Awesome!! ❤️
1,@Polymarket I’m so surprised
1,@TeslaSynopsis I think he should stay in the race; but they’re going to take him out
1,They’re taking Biden fishing soon … https://t.co/5DrBdDnj17
1,True 😂
1,Request a Community Note!
1,@ICannot_Enough @xDaily Exactly
1,Over 15 GWh of Megapacks!
1,@amir What matters is rate of change. The percentage supporting Trump last election was minuscule. This time; it will be massive.
1,@FutureJurvetson So long as California remains a one-party state; it will keep getting worse
1,@then_there_was @Benioff This lays out the issue very clearly
1,@Rothmus Based
1,@xDaily It would be death; not a “burden”
1,@EndWokeness Feels like I’ve heard that somewhere before 🤔
1,@cb_doge I’m not speaking at the RNC
1,@Benioff Marc; I think you’re great and had the best of intentions; but the crazy gross receipts city tax that you supported makes it impossible for financial companies to operate in San Francisco.   That’s why Stripe; Block (CashApp); VISA and many others were forced out of San
1,@emollick This is amazing 🤣🤣
1,@garrytan I hope it works out
1,Check out the new SpaceX EVA spacesuits. These will allow astronauts to do spacewalks.
1,The goal is this diabolical law is to break the parent-child relationship and put the state in charge of your children
1,@DavidSacks @Cernovich Yeah
1,True; usage levels are remaining high
1,@EvaFoxU Must have been tough to eat soup in that outfit
1,Exactly
1,@cb_doge 2008 was super tough
1,Wow; America really is the land of opportunity!
1,He was brilliant
1,@zerohedge Yikes
1,@elon_docs Yeah
1,@mazemoore Mark Cuban is a self-confessed racist; so he just hates himself
1,@paulg Are you using a Tesla?
1,@EricAbbenante She’s mad as a hatter!
1,@chazman @Tesla @Starlink @cybertruck Yes; Cybertruck FSD releases with 12.5; which also finally merges the city and highway code.
1,@eyeslasho Interesting
1,@TheRabbitHole84 Exactly
1,@EzekielOverstr1 It is a beautiful factory
1,@cb_doge I’m living rent-free in his head 🤣🤣
1,@stclairashley That is fundamentally the problem: some politicians think that they own your kids
1,Cybertruck in the wilds
1,Starlink now serving about (Canadian pronunciation) 3% of homes in Canada!
1,For large commercial or community users; the Starlink Gateway terminal provides over 8Gbps of downlink and soon over 8Gbps uplink too
1,@waitbutwhy Always wondered about that
1,@ajtourville These are great
1,@micsolana Weiner is corrupt to the core of his soul
1,@KettlebellDan The old name was far too limiting
1,@alx Nope
1,@ID_AA_Carmack Exactly
1,Thank you for your excellent analysis of just how dangerous this is for children
1,Cybertruck has a sloped roof … just sayin https://t.co/z1jYNmrafy
1,True
1,Can’t believe they didn’t notice Saddam Hussein was there!!
1,@Chesschick01 @X Important to bear in mind that advertisers have a right to place their advertising where they feel it is most effective for sales
1,@WR4NYGov You can do anything on this platform that doesn’t violate or probably violate the law.   Doesn’t mean we condone all that is said; but we believe strongly in freedom of speech.
1,@jhall Maybe that cow should be recruited for sniper watch. Seems to handle that sloped roof really well.
1,@TheRabbitHole84 Absolutely
1,@WallStreetSilv This time it will
1,@Rothmus A CO2 tax; properly applied; would change the tragedy of the commons that is the steadily rising CO2 ppm level. If we’re going to tax anything; then we should prioritize taxing the potentially bad over the potentially good; as we do with alcohol &amp; cigarettes over vegetables &amp; https://t.co/r5uelirNrC
1,Texas https://t.co/iQq68InFi4
1,We have recently received many requests to suspend or otherwise impact accounts on the left.  However; 𝕏 is a free speech platform that aspires to give equal voice to all; within the bounds of the law.   That is what we will do.
1,Wow; steak &amp; eggs with coffee in the morning really feels like a powerup!
1,So here’s the situation … https://t.co/uxpzEsna5v
1,@netcapgirl For gaming; 2 for sure
1,True; the Democratic Party has moved so far left that the Republican Party is now closest to the center
1,The smartest people in the world are on 𝕏
1,@lwoodhouse Calling for the murder of Presidential candidates is illegal
1,@shaunmmaguire First time that I’m being really vocal too.   I think America is in deep trouble if the administration doesn’t change.
1,@Teslaconomics It will work out well
1,True
1,@WallStreetSilv Women who exceed the same high testing standards as men can be bodyguards.   What is messed up is having much lower standards for women than for men.
1,@QuiteBrazen @eyeslasho That is irrational.   There will only be two choices: it is therefore reasonable to pick which administration; all things considered; will be better.
1,@DefiantLs Sigh …
1,Important for civilization to pass the single-planet Fermi Great Filter
1,@MattWalshBlog True
1,@stclairashley Yeah
1,@farzyness Gavin will end up being a commentator on MSNBC watched by about 6 people
1,@shellenberger Gavin’s career is over
1,@KonstantinKisin I agree!
1,@TheOmniLiberal @RubinReport It’s not me; it’s advertisers
1,@mayemusk Yeah; that was cool
1,@GavinNewsom You never get off your knees
1,@cb_doge Takes me back many years
1,The choice is clear
1,Such mean &amp; cruel people they are
1,@WholeMarsBlog Not bad
1,@rauchg I agree
1,@lexfridman Exactly!
1,@cb_doge Yeah
1,@paulg Manner layers of madness here:  National rent control will just stop builders from making new housing units.   Then he also misreads the teleprompter.   And forgets that his own policy is 5%.
1,@paulg Yikes
1,Well said!! https://t.co/CgKPa1rnnt
1,@TheKevinDalton He is actually significantly worse than Anchorman at this point. Can’t even read the prompter!
1,@engineers_feed So long as no one *actually* tries to open the door / assassinate; it will seem like Fort Knox
1,@cb_doge If such a “Roach Motel” tax were to be put in place; founders would go elsewhere
1,@cb_doge The tide is turning
1,The governor of California just signed a bill causing massive destruction of parental rights and putting children at risk for permanent damage.  Important to read this:
1,@yacineMTB @tunguz Yeah
1,@tunguz Authorities keep saying it will get better; but it doesn’t. Last week was the worst experience ever.   Crime is allowed to run rampant in California.
1,As a reminder; Doug Leone of Sequoia Capital publicly voiced his support for Trump 6 weeks ago.   Silicon Valley has shifted.
1,The state will take your kids if you object
1,Many will follow
1,Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz explain why they support Trump
1,@petespano_ @pmarca @bhorowitz “Tiny tech”? Has alliteration going for it.
1,@MikeBenzCyber They will just keep going down as their legacy users pass away
1,@charliekirk11 There certainly will be after the election
1,@Caitlyn_Jenner Thanks
1,Visual approximation of Secret Service Director Cheetos’s “foolproof” assassination protection strategy https://t.co/W1VVor5KNL
1,@PicoPaco17 Anyone here tried whatever that top one is?
1,@EndWokeness There were many straws before that; but that was what finally did it
1,@Rothmus Indeed
1,Have had enough of dodging gangs of violent drug addicts just to get in and out of the building
1,And 𝕏 HQ will move to Austin
1,@paulg We *are* actually doing X
1,I did make it clear to Governor Newsom about a year ago that laws of this nature would force families and companies to leave California to protect their children
1,@SpeakerJohnson Great
1,@RepDanBishop Minus 100% confidence
1,Looks very slopey …
1,Done
1,This is the final straw.   Because of this law and the many others that preceded it; attacking both families and companies; SpaceX will now move its HQ from Hawthorne; California; to Starbase; Texas.
1,@Jason @GavinNewsom A lot of families and companies will move out of California because of this law.   Who would want to risk the state taking away their kids?
1,@EndWokeness Crushing freedom of speech under a jackboot is what that government is doing
1,@MikeBenzCyber Absolutely
1,@MarioNawfal This is so messed up
1,@cb_doge The slopes are the same.   She’s either lying; staggeringly incompetent or both.
1,@ggreenwald The lack of accountability in DC needs to needs to change bigtime
1,@charliekirk11 Director Cheetos needs to be fired immediately. What an idiot!
1,@DavidSacks Unless you can make changes to any given team; the team will fail
1,@EndWokeness It’s beyond absurd for so many reasons!
1,@MikeBenzCyber Dumbest excuse I’ve heard in a long time!  So an untrained kid can handle that simple roof no problem; but professional snipers can’t?  And … just find a sloped roof somewhere if you want to assassinate Presidential candidates!?
1,@paulg Exactly
1,@MarioNawfal Damn; they must be next-level spicy!
1,@DavidSacks Well done
1,@PeterSweden7 Yay; I hope so!
1,This would be great
1,@LibertyCappy Pretty much
1,The state will take away your kids in California
1,@cb_doge Sure seems that way
1,@PhysInHistory So much in that excellent formula
1,Build a Community around anything at all on 𝕏!  Could be local neighborhood news &amp; events; video games; movies; school discussions or anything at all; large or small.
1,@robbystarbuck We should be greatful to have freedom of the press in the USA. It is so rare.
1,@naval Yeah
1,How to mute posts with words you find annoying
1,@alojoh I try not to start fights; but I do finish them
1,@johnkrausphotos @Starlink @Tesla Cool
1,@Cmdr_Hadfield @TheRealBuzz One of the greatest things humanity ever did
1,@xDaily They sure like to dig their own grave
1,@EndWokeness Yeah
1,@WholeMarsBlog Take away the subsidies. It will only help Tesla.   Also; remove subsidies from all industries!
1,@stevenmarkryan Exactly
1,@cb_doge Biden would never agree
1,@WholeMarsBlog Yeah 🤷‍♂️
1,@shane64631 @X If Sauron was posting on 4chan:   &gt; my red eye hurts so bad  &gt; i need a dump truck of visine &gt; then crazy midgets steal my fav bling  &gt; to throw it in a volcano  &gt; mfw
1,Both @Tesla and @xAI are looking to hire networking engineers &amp; technicians
1,If we just grow market share enough; there won’t be anywhere else to advertise 🤷‍♂️
1,@westcoastbill @X Yeah
1,@jeremykauffman Works for me 😀
1,@VigilantFox Accurate
1,@Cernovich Oh yeah lol
1,@zerohedge Nobody ever gets fired; even when a presidential candidate is almost assassinated!   Incompetence costs lives.
1,@sentdefender What an unrepentant imbecile
1,@shaunmmaguire If no one gets fired or resigns; everyone should get fired
1,@cb_doge I was pulling network cables on Saturday to understand the critical path better.  Went through both the Tesla and xAI supercomputer clusters.
1,@BasedMikeLee @VivekGRamaswamy Sounds great
1,@tunguz It’s insane.  Last Wednesday night; we got stuck in the garage at the X/Twitter HQ (on Market Street!); because a gang was doing drugs in the street and wouldn’t move!
1,@GadSaad @JDVance1 @realDonaldTrump Absolutely
1,@PlanetOfMemes @JackPosobiec Exactly
1,Timely truth is immensely important for the collective consciousness to function well
1,More than double the power of the Saturn V moon rocket!  https://t.co/0e5I4zrJQj
1,@MattWalshBlog @JDVance1 Assassination insurance
1,@DefiantLs W for sure
1,@realchrisrufo Definitely
1,@DavidSacks @VivekGRamaswamy Absolutely
1,@TheRabbitHole84 Being another copycat is no way to succeed
1,@VigilantFox Agreed
1,––––––– TRUMP VANCE –––––––  Resounds with victory
1,Congratulations @JDVance1!  Excellent decision by @realDonaldTrump.
1,@DavidSacks Great choice
1,@GiorgiaMeloni Poor guy. May he rest in peace.
1,@KettlebellDan I almost never use following anymore
1,@ajtourville Wtf are they talking about!?
1,@markpinc It was a stupidly high price 😔
1,@imPenny2x Exactly
1,@DavidSacks Really is
1,The legacy media misled the public
1,𝕏 usage hit another all-time high yesterday with 417 billion user-seconds globally!  In the US; user-seconds reached 93B; 23% higher than the previous record of 76B.  In a single day.
1,@MikeBenzCyber Super weird
1,WSJ management needs to clean house over there.   If there is any news organization on Earth that should be unabashedly pro capitalism; it is the WALL STREET Journal; for goodness sake!  It’s literally in the name lmao.
1,By the way; you can easily mute all posts that have words you find annoying.   Just pop over to the settings page.
1,@WR4NYGov Requested what I think is an important design change to the front; and extra time allows us to show off a few other things
1,@ScottPolhamus @catturd2 @LibertyCappy @alifarhat79 @MarioNawfal @ElonMuskAOC @TaraBull808 Accurate use of meme
1,@chamath Exactly
1,I tried using both 𝕏 and legacy media this weekend; but legacy media was so far behind and wrong that it was pointless.   When something is wrong on 𝕏; it is corrected very fast; but it stays wrong for hours to days on legacy media.
1,@alx Mensch move
1,@atensnut Interesting choice of no scope
1,@alx @GOPconvention Yeah!
1,@StephenKing Hahaha
1,@stillgray Epic headline
1,Could be a man or a woman; to be clear; just needs to be large enough to do the job. Someone like Brienne of Tarth would be fine. https://t.co/pwDBAzbje2
1,@Jason Exactly.   Positions should be based on merit only; especially when lives are at stake.
1,@ClownWorld_ Yeah
1,@greg_price11 Contemptible
1,@libsoftiktok Evil
1,@TeslaBoomerMama Appreciate the thought
1,Having a small person as body cover for a large man is like an undersized Speedo at the beach – doesn’t cover the subject
1,@zebulgar Strange coincidence
1,Interesting thread
1,@cb_doge @TheMilkBarTV Absolutely
1,@cb_doge Supplemental security would be wise
1,@robbystarbuck Either way; many should be fired.  Extreme incompetence is indistinguishable from sabotage/conspiracy; but that they failed badly in their job is unquestionably true; therefore they need to go.
1,@aresteanu @eyeslasho Mentally ill and sadistic
1,@teslaownersSV Yeah
1,@TheRabbitHole84 Exactly
1,@mayemusk @EditionsSouccar Indeed :)
1,@SethDillon Hahah for real
1,@UpdatingOnRome Fantastic show
1,@MarioNawfal Secret Service owns the fail. Period.
1,@BasedMikeLee Absolutely
1,@BillyM2k I have thought that for many weeks now
1,@GailAlfarATX Long way to go
1,@realtoriabrooke How do they know he acted alone if they can’t get into his phone?
1,@dom_lucre You’re right; this is not appropriate content for advertisers
1,@CraigChamberlin @WallStreetSilv Exactly
1,@MostlyPeacefull Accurate. I was at that dinner a few tables away from Trump.   At the time; I thought it seemed messed up to be picking on someone in the audience so meanly.
1,@teslaownersSV Absolutely
1,ONE HUNDRED PERCENT
1,@TEDchris Snap; snap … time to wake UP Chris
1,@jessica_kirsh Oh well 😂
1,The best “reporters” are actual experts in a subject or those actually at the scene
1,@realchrisrufo They should be fired immediately
1,@Rothmus Absolutely
1,@Cernovich Contemptible
1,@Chesschick01 True
1,@libsoftiktok Great question
1,@stillgray Those lawsuits are coming
1,The legacy media is a pure propaganda machine. 𝕏 is the voice of the people.
1,The New York Times just published this about Trump today.   They are truly callous and despicable human beings. Not a shred of empathy. https://t.co/zPmP4pj0bC
1,@cb_doge Pretty much
1,@SERobinsonJr Yeah; this is an issue
1,@ggreenwald @reidhoffman True
1,@JTLonsdale Absolutely
1,@Erdayastronaut This is an important design improvement
1,@BillyM2k Seriously
1,@BillAckman Absolutely
1,@HSajwanization It was needed
1,@Cernovich Good question
1,@ChayaRaichik10 Same
1,@shaunmmaguire Absolutely
1,@Cernovich You’re right
1,@Cernovich So before being in charge of protecting the President; she was guarding bags of Cheetos …
1,Extreme incompetence or it was deliberate. Either way; the SS leadership must resign.
1,@JackPosobiec He ought to be in jail
1,@LibertyLockPod That would be next-level
1,@WallStreetSilv Lack of manpower does not explain it. Bystanders tried to point out the sniper to security (in a very obvious location) for minutes before the shooting
1,@RubinReport Absolutely
1,@octal Absolutely.   Easy shot from an obvious sniper position.
1,@JackPosobiec Yeah
1,@WholeMarsBlog Maybe it’s time to build that flying metal suit of armor
1,@stillgray Dangerous times ahead.   Two people (separate occasions) have already tried to kill me in the past 8 months. They were arrested with guns about 20 mins drive from Tesla HQ in Texas.
1,@VivekGRamaswamy You very much predicted this
1,The head of the Secret Service and the leader of this security detail should resign
1,The Reid Hoffman’s of the world got their dearest wish … but then the martyr lived https://t.co/laaRBc5yol
1,@MarioNawfal Poor guy
1,@eoghan Reid is afraid that if Trump wins; Reid will be prosecuted for going to Epstein’s island
1,Last time America had a candidate this tough was Theodore Roosevelt
1,@shellenberger Major fail
1,@dogeofficialceo Exactly
1,I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery https://t.co/ZdxkF63EqF
1,@amytongwu The computers are choosing our mates
1,@TeslaBoomerMama They are contemptible parasites on the neck of Tesla
1,It is the first rocket booster &amp; spaceship design capable of doing so
1,@elon_docs Yeah
1,@nima_owji Absolutely
1,@MikeBenzCyber Correct
1,@battleangelviv Absolutely
1,Starlink making progress in Japan
1,Cool
1,@MarioNawfal Cool
1,@WallStreetSilv Is this real?
1,@Liv_Boeree Blue checks were being bought and sold openly.   One didn’t even need to go to the “dark web”; you could just Google “blue check for sale”!
1,@mr_james_c @historyscientis @KonstantinKisin This is simply another manifestation of the extinctionist / death cult philosophy: convince people that they’re terrible via ancestor guilt.
1,Fidias is right. Super important decision.
1,@jeffskoll Thanks Jeff 🙏
1,Congrats!  https://t.co/HzPyFxuVEV
1,@johnkrausphotos @edwards345 It’s like being at home
1,@Matt_Pinner Reminds me of Elden Ring
1,@teslaownersSV Thanks :)
1,@teslaownersSV Starship is the kind of thing that makes people from little kids to seniors excited about the future!
1,@lhfang They obviously think importing oil illegals as voters gains more than losing disgruntled citizen voters
1,@tszzl Some valid concerns
1,@stevenmarkryan It is great
1,@naval Been happening for a few years now (sigh)
1,@westcoastbill Indeed
1,Accurate
1,@Liv_Boeree Best boss fight song ever https://t.co/cLjP7uUmUL
1,@BillyM2k 😂  It does need to work better
1,@enriquebrgn Major DM upgrades coming!
1,@EndWokeness End of days vibes
1,We were told AI doom would be a paper clip maximizer; but it’s actually going to be Strawberry Fields Forever 🥁
1,@SpaceX Shooting stars
1,@Not_the_Bee Everyone already knows he was a gay vampire!
1,Epic sideburns
1,@Jason It’s insane that the state can steal your child!
1,We look forward to a very public battle in court; so that the people of Europe can know the truth
1,@ajtourville Absolutely!
1,Exactly
1,@rookisaacman Thanks Jared. We will investigate the issue and look for any other potential near-misses.  We are tracking to do more Falcon flights this year than Shuttle did in 30 years; the vast majority of which are uncrewed.   A major advantage of this super high flight rate is that we can
1,@Rainmaker1973 Best book spine design ever
1,The European Commission offered 𝕏 an illegal secret deal: if we quietly censored speech without telling anyone; they would not fine us.   The other platforms accepted that deal.   𝕏 did not.
1,@vestager @X The DSA IS misinformation!
1,Exactly; the legacy media is literally yesterday’s news
1,The legacy media is a propaganda machine
1,@EndWokeness Is this for sure real? That would be an overwhelming percentage increase for any town or city.
1,New Tesla Model 3 version available in America.   363 miles of range for $35k!
1,@MarioNawfal Yeah
1,@chrispavlovski Great
1,@ThierryBreton @DigitalEU How we know you’re real? 🧐
1,@AdrianDittmann I wouldn’t know anything about that 😂
1,@WallStreetSilv Great question
1,@DimaZeniuk Appreciate it
1,@HSajwanization Thanks 🙏
1,@AndrewCurran_ Assume anything in NYT is at least 50% fiction
1,@WholeMarsBlog The amount of testing time it takes to figure out if the new AI is better than the existing AI as measured by miles between interventions is the limiting factor on progress.   The better FSD gets the longer it takes to find interventions.
1,@blueskykites @WholeMarsBlog @DirtyTesLa @brandonee916 @DBurkland @BLKMDL3 @TacosandTeslas @TeslaJoy @tesla_raj @TesLatino @BeardedTesla Hydrogen is so dumb for cars
1,@WholeMarsBlog Yeah
1,@Chesschick01 @TheBabylonBee Reality is so far beyond parody
1,@BillboardChris This suicidal mind virus is spreading throughout Western Civilization
1,@BillboardChris This is insane
1,@SpaceX We’re updating satellite software to run the ion thrusters at their equivalent of warp 9.   Unlike a Star Trek episode; this will probably not work; but it’s worth a shot.  The satellite thrusters need to raise orbit faster than atmospheric drag pulls them down or they burn up.
1,@SERobinsonJr Upper stage restart to raise perigee resulted in an engine RUD for reasons currently unknown. Team is reviewing data tonight to understand root cause.  Starlink satellites were deployed; but the perigee may be too low for them to raise orbit. Will know more in a few hours.
1,@ajtourville We were mugged!
1,@BillyM2k Yeah
1,@reddit_lies @WholeMarsBlog It really is
1,@cb_doge Late-stage civilization vibes 😬
1,@NathanLeamerDC @micsolana The most entertaining outcome is the most likely
1,@shaunmmaguire Reality is beyond parody!
1,@JordanUhl This is real!!??
1,@RodFergusson Those are pretty great
1,@farzyness Wow; you really get so much more from YouTube?
1,Starlink Mini
1,@mayemusk @ToscaMusk @kimbal Good move @ToscaMusk
1,@thejefflutz @POTUS @Tesla Does seem weird
1,True
1,Good Tesla self-driving demo.   It’s true; buying anything except a Tesla will seem like buying a horse &amp; buggy.
1,@farzyness Cool :)
1,@mayemusk @neuralink Very talented &amp; dedicated team
1,@robbystarbuck Posting on LinkedIn is so embarrassing. Borderline fireable offense imo.
1,@RichardHanania Best to hear it in the words I have used in many interviews over the years.   I have not fwiw “volunteered my sperm” 😂  No one at SpaceX has been directed to work on a Mars city. When people have asked to do so; I’ve said we need to focus on getting there first.
1,Having seen the evidence unearthed today by Congress; 𝕏 has no choice but to file suit against the perpetrators and collaborators in the advertising boycott racket.   Hopefully; some states will consider criminal prosecution.
1,@cb_doge Amazingly versatile!
1,@diana_dukic Nikola Tesla was great and AC was the right move back then.   These days; with the proliferation of electronics that use DC and advanced power electronics; it would be better to use DC.   High voltage DC is also materially more efficient for long distance electricity
1,@stillgray Death penalty
1,@alx Seems like a great kid

1,@ray4tesla DoJ support was appreciated; but we were already suspending the Russian accounts
1,@ggreenwald How swiftly times change
1,@ehikian Congrats

1,@tsarnick Good point
1,@Devon_Eriksen_ Accurate 😂  Confusing resource/capital allocation with consumption is a common axiomatic error.  The absurdity of being anti-corporate while simultaneously wanting to transfer responsibility to the government; which is really just the biggest corporation of all; is astounding!
1,@cb_doge Hopefully; wars between large powers in the future will be limited to drone battles; so less human life is wasted
1,@andst7 I think cybernetic superpowers are likely in the future

1,@xDaily xAI contracted for 24k H100s from Oracle and Grok 2 trained on those. Grok 2 is going through finetuning and bug fixes. Probably ready to release next month.   xAI is building the 100k H100 system itself for fastest time to completion. Aiming to begin training later this month.

1,@SmokeAwayyy @spacejanitorX Noted
1,@stillgray @TheOfficial1984 There should be no “special categories”. A clear call to violence against anyone is not ok.
1,@stillgray Seriously
1,@libsoftiktok Great question. The media all turned in unison like a marching band. So weird!
1,This is an excellent way to assess someone’s rationality.  Another way is to ask them to assign a probability to their argument being true vs false. Anyone who says anywhere close to 100% for a matter where there is subjectivity is full of 💩.
1,@TheOfficial1984 Gage made repeated and clear calls for violence; which is illegal; hence 6 month suspension.   Rule applies to everyone; apart from the “UN exemption” for recognized leaders of countries. If politicians can say something to the UN General Assembly; then they can say it here.

1,@Klaus_Arminius What the heck is going on in Germany?  This is not right.
1,@TurkeyBeaver Looks familiar
1,When combined with mail-in ballots; the system is *designed* to make it impossible to prove fraud.  Mail-in and drop box ballots should not be allowed; as cameras on the in-person voting stations would at least prevent large-scale fraud by counting how many people showed up vs

1,@WallStreetSilv Almost every illegal is a Dem voter. Therefore; the Dem Party will not take action until they lose more votes due to ushering in vast numbers of illegals than they gain.  They are counting on complacency from Dem and independent voters; which; at least so far; has worked.  Simple
1,@DavidSacks Accurate
1,@DrKnowItAll16 @OpenAI @Tesla We have been short on training compute for FSD; so haven’t trained with other video; but certainly could. Will do it later this year when we have some spare capacity.
1,@DrKnowItAll16 @OpenAI @Tesla Tesla has been able to do real-world video generation with accurate physics for about a year.   It wasn’t super interesting; because all the training data came from the cars; so it just looks like video from a Tesla; albeit with a dynamically generated (not remembered) world.

1,@var_epsilon But their music video was 🔥🔥 https://t.co/t15krsao34
1,@WholeMarsBlog Exactly
1,@farzyness I hope it continues to be routine!  You know the revolution in rocket reusability is succeeding when it happens so many times that it no longer makes the news.
1,SpaceX has moved its state of incorporation from Delaware to Texas!  If your company is still incorporated in Delaware; I recommend moving to another state as soon as possible. https://t.co/B7FLByL2dY
1,@TimDOES @NHTSAgov Yeah; this needs to stop
1,@shaunmmaguire Definitely
1,@CollinRugg “Space” 🤔
1,Four rockets on their launch pads simultaneously
1,Amazing that some people still think the news is real 😂
1,@StephenKing Stop deadnaming 𝕏  Respect our transition 😂
1,@SawyerMerritt It is our hope to help both the people of Israel and; with all due care; innocent civilians in Gaza.  This approval by @Israel is greatly appreciated.   In such a terrible situation; we should strive for conspicuous acts of kindness whenever possible.
1,@DavidSacks Exactly
1,@TheTeslaBull @SawyerMerritt Absolutely
1,@GregAbbott_TX Absolutely

1,@TheBabylonBee Lmaooo
1,@astro_greek I was just a baby then
1,@ScottAdamsSays Pretty much
1,@alx Such an absurdly bold-faced lie!
1,@MikeBenzCyber This is really affecting my confidence in government 😂
1,@teslaownersSV He was not on FSD. The software had unfortunately never been downloaded. I say “unfortunately”; because the accident probably would not have happened if FSD had been engaged.
1,@AlexanderPayton Yeah
1,@AdrianDittmann @karpathy @darshilistired Yeah!
1,@stclairashley @alx Makes total sense that Mayorkas was on the board of an organization that has the explicit goal of facilitating illegal immigration; given that he is now continuing that mission as Homeland Secretary
1,@TimSweeneyEpic What’s up with this?
1,@AlecStapp Ehrlich was instrumental in causing a massive genocide of the next generation of humans
1,@alx Mayorkas is deliberately breaking the law and ushering in vast numbers of illegals; while claiming to do the opposite. He needs to go.
1,@MarioNawfal Making progress!
1,@SawyerMerritt It is already well underway
1,@chamath A basic cognitive test should not be something that someone who controls nuclear strikes is allowed to skip!
1,@Baurakale7 @Not_the_Bee It’s one or the other. Can’t have it both ways.
1,@3hinomaru Noted
1,@MikeBenzCyber @America1stLegal This is insane
1,@HardcoreHistory @jonstewart Exactly
1,Which path; Western World? https://t.co/b2tLjQ2NVD
1,@fentasyl They’re just turning the microphone nbd
1,@EdKrassen Isn’t it super basic and the same test every time?  I’d settle for “what year is it and what is your job?”
1,@Benioff Positive trend :)
1,@SethDillon Passing a basic cognitive test should not be optional for someone who controls the nuclear football!
1,@WallStreetSilv Yeah
1,@cb_doge True

1,@cstanley @teslaownersSV Nope 🤣
1,@TheDailyShow @farzyness Balance and humor return!

1,And we are only 6 weeks into 2024!
1,@TheRabbitHole84 Wow; a whole 12 hours
1,@teslaownersSV It is so improbable
1,@GadSaad More posts were viewed on this platform over Super Bowl than there are humans on the planet
1,@teslaownersSV Spaceships by the beach
1,@BillyM2k Such a beautiful movie
1,@Dr_Merica2 @RepThomasMassie Highly likely
1,@_SFTahoe Exactly
1,@dogeofficialceo Yup; that’s us
1,@teslaownersSV It will be at least 10 to 15 meters longer by version 3
1,@dogeofficialceo Still a lot to fight; but the trend is good
1,@alx There has been no change in the Russia-Ukraine border for a year; just lots of dead kids.  What kind of psycho wants that to continue?
1,@alx Unexpected
1,@ID_AA_Carmack Interesting
1,@WholeMarsBlog Who are these knuckleheads?
1,@WholeMarsBlog Seriously; what an idiot!  All that actually matters is how many billions of tons of carbon are moved from underground to the atmosphere. Everything else is immaterial.  Solve sustainable energy on the surface (solar/wind/nuclear/geothermal) and you solve it all.
1,@alx Seriously 😬
1,@GadSaad I have actual Mossad merch btw.   But the CIA has some really great merch.
1,@TrungTPhan Japan is awesome

1,@tunguz What will all that AI do?
1,@EvaFoxU 😂 so true
1,@CollinRugg Our subways could really use an extreme makeover
1,@eyeslasho That chart seems very wrong. Almost everyone I know who studied CS likes programming.
1,@eyeslasho Does seem concerning that maybe the hormones injections (especially sudden; large amounts of testosterone) could be a major causal factor in violence
1,@BillyM2k Whoa; they really go at it!
1,@kanyewest Starship were meant to fly and our next one launches in about 3 weeks; but I recommend waiting for a few more test flights before hopping on board   @NICKIMINAJ

1,@VandykSimon @ID_AA_Carmack Classified
1,@bgurley True
1,@stillgray Everyone pays full price for a Tesla; including me
1,Since most people don’t love to buy cars in the middle of winter; Tesla is offering a $1000 incentive to do so.  This is the essential quandary of manufacturing: factories need continuous production for efficiency; but consumer demand is seasonal.

1,@VandykSimon @ID_AA_Carmack Costly; but yes; there are uses that are worth it
1,@NeuraPod All companies should move out of Delaware
1,@tunguz Heck yeah!
1,@WallStreetSilv True. Just a question of how many kids die before that is acknowledged.
1,@ID_AA_Carmack Lithium metal is so low density that it feels like you’re holding styrofoam!
1,@ID_AA_Carmack Cool idea to have samples of elemental materials.   Titanium is a surprisingly poor thermal conductor and silver is the best.   Carbon in diamond form beats everything by far. Even just mashing diamond dust into copper gives a big boost to its thermal conductivity!

1,@MikeBenzCyber This is so bizarre
1,@Not_the_Bee We are all descended from both slaves and slave owners.   All.   It’s just a matter of when.
1,This year; the @SpaceX Dragon spaceship will take astronauts the furthest they’ve been from Earth in over half a century
1,To keep scrolling 𝕏 while using AirPlay; turn off autoplay for videos
1,@SawyerMerritt Whoa; 12 years ago!
1,@Not_the_Bee Wasn’t some of the classified material 20+ years old?   Not that I think we should prosecute Presidents for things like this; but it would only be has been senile for a long time.

1,@LeadingReport Time for Mitch to go
1,@stillgray Absolutely!
1,@stevenmarkryan They still censor the truth

1,@TheRabbitHole84 True
1,@MikeBenzCyber This post could come back to haunt me; but my guess is that she probably stays out of politics this time around
1,@GadSaad I think your posts are great
1,@GailAlfarATX Thanks for being an independent journalist
1,@GadSaad I read the translation of the Qu’ran (English version) and many other religious texts as a kid trying to understand the world
1,Good advice for how best use 𝕏
1,@jasondebolt Chuck labors under the illusion that western civilization is not at risk; when it clearly is.   If America falls; nothing else matters; not stocks; not properties; nothing.  All civilizations eventually fall; as history shows; but we want this one to last as long as possible.

1,@WholeMarsBlog True. The judge in Delaware who improperly rescinded my comp literally earns more than I do.
1,@ggreenwald Yeah
1,@GadSaad 😂 your talent at dry comedy is excellent
1,𝕏 is now the #1 most downloaded app of any kind! https://t.co/TeqWxcmZfs

1,@ggreenwald To be fair; it’s hard for them to talk while giving a blowjob at the same time
1,@stclairashley Yeah
1,@ScottAdamsSays It is bizarre that this fake “border protection” bill was allowed to be written in the first place. I’d like to know who the individuals are who wrote it (wasn’t the politicians).

1,@Jason Yeah; doesn’t seem like you need an army for this product!
1,@stillgray @rizzmatism @stclairashley Exactly
1,@farzyness Doesn’t feel like it is there yet. I tried Vision out; but it didn’t blow me away.  iPhone 1 wasn’t great either imo. Lower utility than alternatives; all things considered; but by iPhone 3 it was unequivocally the best “smartphone”.

1,@cb_doge Probably
1,@KTmBoyle Pretty good start
1,@KanekoaTheGreat The American foreign policy track record since WW2 – even if you *agree* with the goals – is terrible!  Castro outlived every US President that tried to kill him; the Ayatollah is still in charge in Iran; Kim Jon Un still rules North Korea; etc.
1,@KTmBoyle Yeah!
1,@CraigChamberlin @WallStreetSilv True 🤣
1,@VivekGRamaswamy Yeah
1,@WallStreetSilv Old Twitter crushed any voices on the right; so half the country had no voice.   X simply allows both sides to voice their arguments.

1,@stillgray Arrest those calling for his arrest!
1,If evil people are given a moral cloak that cannot be questioned; they are certain to wear it.  This is not to say that all transgender people are bad – that would be false – but rather that they should be no more above questioning than anyone else.
1,@stillgray Disney has almost certainly broken the law thousands of times (no exaggeration)
1,@zerohedge Great idea!
1,@Jason Regarding point 2; what’s weird is how slavishly compliant western media is to government even *without* coercion!
1,@stillgray I expect this to be one of many lawsuits against Disney.  They have been blatantly racist; sexist &amp; censorious for years; which means there is a vast treasure trove of emails/texts/slack/etc.

1,@EndWokeness Major scam
1,@SpeakerJohnson Absolutely
1,@fentasyl Exactly
1,Well-summarized
1,@stclairashley Exactly; this is a massive monetary incentive to *increase* the flow of illegals!
1,The long-term goal of the so-called “Border Security” bill is enabling illegals to vote!  It will do the total opposite of securing the border.
1,Thank you
1,Good progress!
1,@teslaownersSV First; no one has ever mentioned rehab to me ever.   Second; if they are saying that I was able to lead Tesla to be by far the most valuable carmaker and SpaceX to be by far the most valuable space company *simultaneously*; that is the greatest compliment I have ever received!
1,@RadioGenoa Sources?
1,@krassenstein Agreed
1,@ScottAdamsSays Recommend that they also read X. Worst case; they will have a better understanding of the so-called “hoaxes”.   They don’t need to stop reading NY Times; but they probably will once they realize they’ve been had.

1,@alex_avoigt That part is not awesome; but it doesn’t matter. Electric vehicles are inevitable.
1,@realCarola2Hope @SecMayorkas For massively amplifying the problem; not merely being incompetent
1,@EndWokeness @SecMayorkas I agree
1,@BillyM2k They are importing as many voters as possible before the elections
1,@CollinRugg What a tangled web!
1,Impeach @SecMayorkas for deliberately breaking the law and massively increasing illegal immigration beyond all historical precedent
1,In the “bet-you-didn’t-know” category; Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas issued written guidance making it clear that:  1. Illegal presence alone is not grounds for deportation.  2. Criminal charges; convictions or gang membership alone are not enough for deportation.  You
1,@stclairashley That’s their actual name?

1,@eyeslasho The brain is a computer.   Once you demystify it; you can analyze any given brain for its computational ability; just like a computer.
1,@eyeslasho Community Notes ftw
1,@alx Not at all
1,As a general rule; if you believe *everything* your political party says; you are an idiot
1,@dogeofficialceo The competition is not super strong in this regard lol
1,@mayemusk More people should visit China
1,@4chan_green Niche joke 😂
1,We should not; for example; impose draconian laws on farmers or make citizens uncomfortable by limiting air-conditioner usage!  Keep tax revenue constant; but shift it to  tax what is probably bad (CO2); just like alcohol &amp; cigarettes are taxed more than fruits &amp; vegetables.
1,The only action needed to solve climate change is is a carbon tax
1,@FlyinBuddha @disclosetv It should be
1,@KimDotcom Feels that way
1,@zerohedge Very much so
1,@VivekGRamaswamy Exactly
1,@Not_the_Bee Anyone can claim asylum with no proof. It is the magic word that gets anyone; even hardened criminals; into America.
1,@cb_doge Yeah
1,Most people in America don’t know that the census is based on a simple headcount of people (including illegals) *not* just citizens.    This shifts political power and money to states and Congressional districts with the highest number of illegals.
1,@nypost Makes no sense
1,@TechBroDrip @WholeMarsBlog Now he can crack walnuts with his fists
1,@fentasyl Krugman is a candidate for most wrong economist who is still alive
1,@eyeslasho Yeah; I don’t know anyone who uses Facebook
1,@CollinRugg What is even the point of arresting criminals if nothing is done!? No prison; no deportation.
1,@therealZNO I was embarrassingly slow to figure it out
1,@CollinRugg He’s right
1,@AdamLowisz @krassenstein Exactly
1,This explains why there are so few deportations; as every deportation is a lost vote.  As happened this week; you can literally assault police officers in broad daylight in New York; be released with no bail; give everyone the finger and *still* not be deported!!  Outrageous.
1,@jasondebolt I believe this is referred to as “ballot harvesting”.   They just send people to pick up the ballots; as in-person voting and proof of citizenship is not required.
1,@Marslamute Due to opposition by Senators Manchin and Sinema; it did not.   However; Manchin retires this year and Sinema has been ousted from the Democratic Party; so neither will be there to stop this next year.
1,Here is the full text of the bill. It sounds so reasonable at first; just like “The Committee of Public Safety” actually meant “The Cutting Off Heads Committee” in revolutionary France. https://t.co/DCMTHHEIjM
1,Biden’s strategy is very simple:  1. Get as many illegals in the country as possible.  2. Legalize them to create a permanent majority – a one-party state.  That is why they are encouraging so much illegal immigration. Simple; yet effective. https://t.co/B9M5ypUOQB

1,Dr. Drew gets it
1,@alx That was certainly what they actually did; but it is challenging getting things approved politically with an honest title
1,@TrungTPhan Allies’ advantage in radar certainly helped; but was not the decisive factor.   The foundation of war is economics; specifically industrial capacity; and the Allies were far stronger in this regard.
1,@nearcyan That’s what they said
1,@alex_avoigt She has done more to damage Delaware than any judge in modern history
1,When you hear the names of legislation or anything done by the government; it is worth remembering that the group that sent so many people to the guillotine during the French Revolution was called “The Committee of Public Safety”; not the “Cut Off Their Heads Committee”
1,@PhysInHistory Asimov was amazing

1,Outrageous!
1,@CollinRugg @YourWebmiester @RNCResearch The leadership is the problem. Border Patrol officers have no choice; so not their fault.

1,The public vote is unequivocally in favor of Texas!  Tesla will move immediately to hold a shareholder vote to transfer state of incorporation to Texas.

1,The United States is being overwhelmed
1,@WholeMarsBlog Exactly
1,Should Tesla change its state of incorporation to Texas; home of its physical headquarters?
1,I recommend incorporating in Nevada or Texas if you prefer shareholders to decide matters

1,@MelissaJeanSays @EndWokeness The sentence is excessive if they were not violent

1,If Denver is having trouble with 40;000 illegals; how will they handle the next 400;000?   The illegal influx is growing exponentially and just exceeded babies born in America last month!
1,@stclairashley @EdKrassen @RareImagery @krassenstein Exactly.   And even if economics is not what they tell officials; it is obviously the reason for coming to America.  Especially when states like California make medical care free for illegals. No amount of money can increase the number of doctors as fast as people can move here;
1,@EdKrassen @RareImagery Here comes the actual hard part: what is the solution?  Court dates are 5 to 7 years away and growing to infinity.
1,@thejefflutz @Tesla Thanks!
1,@TesLatino Sorry it took so long
1,@alx And deport more than zero illegals. That would help too.
1,@alx Change the asylum rule that allows anyone to claim asylum with no proof and that classifies “economic reasons” as sufficient; as that means basically 80% of Earth
1,@SmileRainbow6 @PezRadar Exactly.  And pointless to try to achieve a fast clear time unless you’re a Barb.
1,@KettlebellDan It should have a screen on the outside too; like the @SphereVegas. That would be sickkk.

1,@libsoftiktok And it’s still only January.   The US is only 5% of Earth’s population; so it doesn’t take much of the rest of the world to overwhelm the system.

1,@cremieuxrecueil Interesting
1,@krassenstein I did not say that all legacy media is fake. You are applying the straw man fallacy to my statement.   I simply implied that it is foolish to swallow what the conventional press says without applying critical thinking.

1,Legacy media controlling what subjects they write about is by far their biggest lie; as they can ignore important matters and inflate minor ones.   𝕏 enables the people to define the narrative.
1,@MarceloPLima @Austen Media control of the narrative is by far their biggest lie
1,@Austen Is this for real?
1,@hardestgeezer This kind of interaction is what makes 𝕏 special
1,@TashfeenKhanPML @Rob_2628 Yeah; by a giant margin
1,@Rob_2628 Wow; Barb is so strong that there is no point in other classes!  Unfortunately; it takes a long time to build up your character in Diablo; so I can’t afford the time to switch from Druid.   Will hold off playing further until there is a character balance that allows other classes

1,@RepThomasMassie That is because they were largely improperly sued into oblivion by class action lawyers.   Class action reform is sorely needed; as it is a massive hidden tax in consumers. I recommend requiring that at least 10% of a class be required to vote for the lawsuit for it to be

1,@eldsjal Very concerning
1,@libsoftiktok @LexRich5Schools True
1,@Not_the_Bee @POTUS Building a wall is a red herring. No wall is needed to fix this situation.   Border Patrol is being instructed to facilitate illegal entry at scale into the United States.  The fundamental problem is that anyone can claim asylum with zero proof; which means all of Earth can come
1,@POTUS No laws need to be passed. All that is needed is an executive order to require proof before granting an asylum hearing. That is how it used to be.
1,@DavidSacks Exactly
1,@SawyerMerritt There are gigantic differences in the effectiveness of R&amp;D spending between companies
1,@SawyerMerritt The governor is correct that this is a Dojo Supercomputer; but $500M; while obviously a large sum of money; is only equivalent to a 10k H100 system from Nvidia.  Tesla will spend more than that on Nvidia hardware this year. The table stakes for being competitive in AI are at

1,@BillyM2k Yeah!
1,@jgebbia Good question
1,@westcoastbill Starlink would cost even less; but the government requirements made it twice as expensive
1,@EdKrassen Coming soon! In beta testing now.
1,@JoshWalkos @rawsalerts This does seem odd. Why no mask removal after arrest?
1,Heavy use of Spaces
1,@teslaownersSV To the best of my knowledge; we have done nothing to amplify his viewers
1,@ZubyMusic Unfortunately; it is no surprise
1,@WallStreetSilv Exactly
1,@WholeMarsBlog This is crazy; given that Starlink is available right now for a tiny fraction of this cost

1,@paulg Automotive is not a natural monopoly industry. Quite the opposite (sigh).
1,@wudijo Looking forward to the new Diablo Season on Tuesday
1,If you post interesting art; either written or visual; add it to the highlights section of your profile

1,Post your music videos to 𝕏

1,@xDaily Correct
1,@cstanley Yeah
1,@FutureJurvetson @matt_vanswol Exactly. He hasn’t or he wouldn’t make that post.

1,@xDaily Yeah; just refers to the fact that there is a pre-roll ad
1,@WholeMarsBlog Seriously 😂
1,@0xgaut Yeah; it’s weird that the TV now sits on your nose!
1,@xDaily This is fake news from Bloomberg
1,@WalterIsaacson This is simply not accurate

1,@cstanley Exactly
1,@thackerpd @COVIDSelect @hkakeya @FatEmperor @MarioNawfal @WashburneAlex Has there been an official investigation?

1,@SciGuySpace May as well go for a trilogy

1,@radbackwards It is very much so
1,@WholeMarsBlog No feud or battle at all. The Tesla board is excellent.
1,@SawyerMerritt If dual-class can be done; I’m all for it.   It’s weird that a crazy multi-class share structure like Meta has; which gives the next 20+ generations of Zuckerbergs control; is fine pre-IPO; but even a reasonable dual-class is not allowed post-IPO.

1,@teslaownersSV @heyitsyashu Waiting for the case to be decided
1,@cb_doge Destiny will be fulfilled
1,@heyitsyashu I should note that the Tesla board is great. The reason for no new “compensation plan” is that we are still waiting for a decision in my Delaware compensation case. The trial for that was held in 2022; but a verdict has yet to be made.   I put “compensation plan” in quotes;

1,@Rob_2628 @Starlink Cool; streaming on 𝕏; while using Starlink!
1,@heyitsyashu I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI &amp; robotics without having ~25% voting control. Enough to be influential; but not so much that I can’t be overturned.  Unless that is the case; I would prefer to build products outside of Tesla. You don’t seem to understand

1,@PeterSweden7 Is there really no media coverage?
1,@The_Nomad_News @CNN @VivekGRamaswamy @AsaHutchinson @RonPaul This does seem odd

1,@heydave7 I think so
1,@patrickc Hydrocarbons are such a puny source of energy compared to solar (aka free fusion reactor in the sky)
1,@patrickc Rail; highways and formation of cities

1,@GregAbbott_TX @RepCuellar Interesting
1,@WallStreetSilv This is messed up
1,@cb_doge Such a charmer 😊
1,@Rainmaker1973 I suspect the picture exaggerates the difference. Humans have been extremely good at breeding animals for thousands of years.  Look at the wide variety of dogs vs the original wolf.

1,@0xgaut I can’t tell real from parody anymore 😂
1,@Emboothoo Thanks
1,@shaunmmaguire US military strategy is primarily centered around a relatively small number of expensive units; far too many of which are crewed. This is a fundamental mistake.  The outcome of any given battle is probable kill ratio times number of units.
1,@libsoftiktok That is a hardcore wall
1,@alx @stillgray @ScottAdamsSays @VivekGRamaswamy Whatever the exact number; it does seem correct that Vivek did more events than everyone else combined
1,@NoahKahn_ My guess is that Vivek will far exceed the polls when the votes are counted
1,@JTLonsdale An organization is usually the moral sum of its constituents
1,@Not_the_Bee Good
1,@stillgray @ScottAdamsSays @VivekGRamaswamy I was told Vivek did 390 meetings. How many did other candidates do?
1,@SawyerMerritt We have further improvements in the works to tighten the turning circle significantly
1,@ScottAdamsSays @VivekGRamaswamy If it is accurate that Vivek did more meetings with voters than all other candidates combined; then I think he will do very well in the vote on Monday.  The power of an extreme work ethic is usually underestimated.

1,Review of SpaceX achievements in 2023 and plans for 2024+
1,Welcome to 𝕏!
1,@BillyM2k @stclairashley I literally just repeated what elected democrats said. I think we should believe them when they say these things.  There is no more room to house illegals in many cities; as hotel space is filled up; now they’re starting with schools; then what?
1,Funny you should mention “properly-run” social networks.   Are you aware that Mark Zuckerberg; presumably a “proper-runner” of social networks; funded illegal voting vans in the last election?  https://t.co/Sfno4ftHoc

1,@johnkrausphotos @AviationWeek @Free_Space Congratulations @ULA; @blueorigin &amp; @JeffBezos!

1,@WallStreetSilv California made medical care free for illegals last week
1,@EndWokeness Looks much worse
1,@gopher_marc Talking heads that say whatever is on the teleprompter
1,@mayemusk The presenters; with rare exception; are like the character in the movie Anchorman – they just read whatever is on the teleprompter; no matter how absurd.  To give you a sense of just how little thinking goes on; there is the infamously bad reporting about the Korean Airlines
1,@DrKnowItAll16 @SphereVegas It’s great!
1,@dani_elle831 @ylecun @ibeckermayer2 I was saying they *should* be open for 16 hours to make it easier to vote
1,@DumboFromJapan Exactly
1,@ylecun @ibeckermayer2 What have I said that is incorrect?  Unlike almost all countries; such as France; you do not need proof of citizenship to vote in the United States. This is absolutely true.   There have been many state challenges to this; but they have not yet made it past the appeals court.
1,@ylecun Legum is a talented deceiver. Read his posts carefully. I am right.
1,Great lecture https://t.co/rvvR7Bjo66

1,@StephenKing Hot tea on a cold day is very satisfying indeed
1,@natemcgrady Yeah
1,@cb_doge It’s true!  I added an exclamation point at the end to make it slightly less guessable 😂
1,@dogeofficialceo That is the goal
1,@WallStreetSilv Wow; great!
1,The propaganda level in legacy media has become tediously high; but also remarkable for how almost all legacy media repeat the same lies verbatim
1,@AdrianDittmann And if you could actually legislate wealth; everyone would be a trillionaire
1,@EndWokeness Carefully chosen propaganda word
1,Interesting
1,@BillAckman @NeriOxman Business Insider is not a real publication

1,@TheRabbitHole84 Almost all the Marxists are in the “social” sciences. Almost none in the sciences that deal with actual reality 🤣.
1,@stillgray @TheRabbitHole84 Seriously; Tumblr!? Old Twitter was definitely a problem too.   But it had to start somewhere. Let’s keep tracing back.
1,@TheRabbitHole84 Dang; that is a lot of Marxists!  It is easy to live in a fake communist reality when colleges have massive endowments that insulate them from reality.  College donors need to become a *lot* more stringent in their requirements or stop donating.
1,@BillAckman They always do that. BI is the new Gawker: evil to the core.
1,@TheRabbitHole84 Let’s trace route upstream a bit more: how did the college students get programmed with the woke virus?
1,@Rob_2628 Crazy grind indeed! Hopefully less grindy in future seasons.
1,@RodFergusson Looking forward to it

1,Merit should be the only reason for hiring; especially for jobs where your family’s lives are at stake
1,@paulg There is pervasive pessimism in Europe and many parts of America. It is taught in the schools.

1,@benarroch_joe @cb_doge Exactly
1,@waitbutwhy Real possibility.   It is odd that dinosaurs didn’t develop large brains for so many millions of years.
1,@TrungTPhan 🔥🤣  My dog (Marvin) woke me up at 5am to go outside
1,Shifting power back to the people means taking it away from the political class and their puppets in the press
1,@WallStreetSilv Lot of good quotes in this thread
1,@growing_daniel Probably; however illegals are not prevented from voting in federal elections. This came as a surprise to me.
1,@ZubyMusic Most of it was done by a company (British East India) literally founded in a coffee shop
1,@ChayaRaichik10 Exactly
1,@TRHLofficial Cis is definitely a slur. Anyone who uses it should be told so in no uncertain terms.
1,@ThierryBreton @epc_eu I agree
1,@cb_doge True
1,@minchoi Bigtime

1,@SokobanHero @Austen @paulg You’re welcome
1,They’ve run out of hotel rooms; are kicking kids out of school for illegal housing and now they want your homes too
1,@BillyM2k Yeah
1,@cstanley That’s how the legacy media runs
1,This is what happens when you run out of hotel rooms. Soon; cities will run out of schools to vacate. Then they will come for your homes.
1,@stclairashley It does seem like automatic destruction of government documents would be seriously illegal

1,@krassenstein @ggreenwald @zei_squirrel There are around 600 million active accounts on this platform. Mistakes are bound to be made at such a scale; but we try to fix them quickly.   There will always be some false positives and false negatives; but we aspire to take corrective action rapidly.
1,@GalianoTiramani @BillAckman @BOXABL Yes; doxxing is grounds for suspension

1,@satyanadella @PNNLab Interesting
1,@xDaily We are looking into it
1,@EndWokeness Concerning
1,@waitbutwhy Bots are the devil (sigh).  I think a simple AI applied to comments should solve this.
1,@jacksonhinklle In general; suspensions should be even-handed.   We are also very reluctant to have permanent suspensions; so people should expect a series of temporary suspensions that become longer; rather than instant permanent suspensions.
1,@WallStreetSilv Another $65B to Ukraine? What’s the exit strategy?   I support Ukraine; but this seems like a forever war with no progress. Just sacrificing the youth of the country for no territorial gain.
1,Exciting!

1,Welcome to 𝕏!
1,Don Lemon show coming to 𝕏!
1,@jacksonhinklle I will investigate. Obviously; it is ok to be critical of anything; but it is not ok to call for extreme violence; as that is illegal.   (Apart from the “UN Exemption”; where officials from countries recognized by the UN can say what they say at the UN).   For the record; I do
1,@stillgray Ireland already allows non-citizens to vote? In national elections too?
1,@alx @WSJ The @WSJ are a bunch of clowns that deserve no respect
1,@MikeBenzCyber Doesn’t seem like an effective way to combat “disinformation”
1,@KTmBoyle The @WSJ has become so desperate for circulation that they lie on a regular basis
1,Video viewership is increasing rapidly
1,@BillAckman I recommend a lawsuit.
1,Great book
1,@GadSaad I read your insightful book on the parasitic woke mind virus. It gave me nightmares 😬.
1,@GadSaad Saad; but very true
1,@SawyerMerritt Yeah; I was running on very little sleep for several days due to extreme work requirements. Worth noting that Tesla was very close to bankruptcy in 2017.
1,@SokobanHero @WholeMarsBlog Yeah
1,@SpaceX Pretty much everything I predicted in that talk has happened or is in process of happening
1,@WholeMarsBlog Yup; that’s the one 😂
1,@alx So cringe
1,@realDonaldTrump Epic

1,@Meyers85014 @NameRedacted247 @mcuban Exactly
1,@Timcast Just guessing or you have some inside scoop?
1,@alx Yeah
1,@GadSaad @mcuban Well said!

1,@WallStreetApes Yikes!!
1,Whoa; I did not know this
1,@dani_elle831 @teslaownersSV If elections are open for 16 hours; essentially everyone can vote
1,@teslaownersSV We should require government ID and in-person voting (unless valid medical/ military/etc excuse); like other countries do or like if you want to buy beer
1,@TheRabbitHole84 Yeah; that was weird. Literally the same people who said voter ID was racist also demanded that you get a vaccine ID to travel anywhere or work!
1,@krassenstein How does this story end? That’s the question.
1,@EvasTeslaSPlaid @Tesla Does kinda have cylon vibes
1,@EdKrassen It is the hypocrisy that bothers me.   Obviously; women’s (or men’s) sports; for example; are sexist by definition.   What is absurd and hypocritical is to claim that something isn’t racist/sexist when it obviously is!
1,@jgebbia I guess glass is the way to go?
1,@isabelleboemeke Even aluminum cans have plastic liners. The toxicity of plastic is up for debate; but I definitely don’t like the idea of eating plastic!
1,@alx The plot thickens!
1,@mysteriouskat Sure looks that way. Fine for the officer to body block someone trying to get close to a senior government official; but false to say that he deliberately assaulted an officer.

1,@PeterDiamandis AI would be a great teacher for our puny meat computers

1,@teslaownersSV Yeah
1,@stevenmarkryan By mailed in ballots arriving in large numbers; often *after* the physical vote count
1,@CarineKnapen @teslaownersSV Makes sense
1,@HumbleFlow @BillyM2k It’s racist to claim that an adult is incapable of obtaining ID!
1,@Jason_F_YXE Yeah
1,@xDaily Once again; @CommunityNotes ftw
1,@FoundersPodcast Interesting character
1,In the USA; you don’t need government issued ID to vote and you can mail in your ballot. This is insane.

1,@WhatsupFranks Yes; it is happening in many countries
1,The US construction industry can increase available housing by 1% to 2% per year.   But the US population is only 330M out of 8B.   So if just ~4% of Earth moves here; housing would need to double; which is impossible; causing a massive homeless problem and house prices to be

1,@askracher @0xAlaric The impact of rifles in the Napoleonic wars is sometimes dismissed; because so few rifles were produced relative to ball muskets; but this misses the point.   You only have to snipe the officers to disable an enemy army; similar to how even a tiny head shot stops a single human.
1,@inventions4uu @0xAlaric 😂  Just don’t invade Russia. It’s never a good idea.

1,@KatalinNovak_HU Great; hopefully the birth rate changes soon!
1,@DrKnowItAll16 They view them as future Dem voters
1,At this point; there is no question that this administration is actively facilitating illegal immigration.   The numbers speak for themselves.
1,@krassenstein It is currently trivial to claim asylum; as no proof whatsoever is needed; nor is any proof of ID or other documents needed from their home country (they discard their docs shortly before crossing the US border).  We need to require ID; which they used to get to Mexico (almost

1,@GavinSBaker Yeah
1,@geertwilderspvv Agreed; but even countries that have very few immigrants; like Korea and Japan; are experiencing population collapse.   If the birth rate stays as low as it is; the Dutch nation will die out by its own hand.

1,@truth_tesla @ConsumerReports Reason we hustled so much to get Autopilot V1 out was that someone driving non-Autopilot Tesla fell asleep; crashed &amp; killed cyclist (Tesla driver was uninjured).  Driver nonetheless sued us saying new car smell made him fall asleep (sigh). Judge didn’t agree.
1,@DavidNagySFgang @rocketry_catboy Indeed. Grid fin designs clearly work; but do they maximize payload? Good chance that they do not.   Something with much more drag to reduce terminal velocity &amp; so reduce landing propellant might have better performance. Not sure.   Potential future optimization.
1,@WholeMarsBlog The Tesla AI predictions are swiftly becoming superhuman – its guesses for what it can’t see well feel like ESP. It has a vastly larger training set than any human &amp; thinks only about driving.

1,@13ericralph31 @AwakenedParadi1 @demishassabis Probability at 60% &amp; rising rapidly due to new architecture
1,@demishassabis Congratulations
1,@ckgaparajita Coming soon
1,@5AllanLeVito Got it 😀🇺🇦
1,@motorsep Definitely. All major highways in Texas will have Superchargers; all the way to Brownsville &amp; across Mexico.
1,Yes. Supercharger coverage will extend to 100% of Europe next year. From Ireland to Kiev; from Norway to Turkey.
1,Most people don’t know that the Tesla Supercharger network allows easy long distance travel throughout USA; most of Europe; Canada and China https://t.co/ZzN9Tabq8C
1,@martinmeany We are dramatically increasing Tesla Superchargers within cities &amp; working with landlords to add home charging to apartment buildings
1,@JT_Richards @MMelinot @chuckyyyd This is incorrect. Vast majority of vehicle motion is returned to the battery; as the electric motors act like a generator in reverse. Brake pads on a Tesla literally never need to be replaced for lifetime of the car.
1,Most importantly; every electric car; Tesla or otherwise; matters to the environment we all share. Every time someone chooses electric; the future gets a little bit brighter!  If not Tesla; please take a look at these other options: https://t.co/FZVNlGWYgA
1,And; because electricity costs much less than gasoline; a Model 3 can cost about $1000 less per year to operate. Because it’s electric; there are no oil changes; smog checks; tuneups; fuel filter; or brake pad replacements.
1,There are also many state &amp; local incentives; for example California offers $2500; plus $800 from utilities &amp; access to carpool lane; Colorado $4000; etc https://t.co/lmD3ZNFR9M
1,Reminder to US buyers that the $7500 tax credit cuts in half in 5 days! Order online at https://t.co/46TXqRrsdr to see if there is any inventory left in your region or visit Tesla stores.
1,Merry Christmas &amp; goodwill to all!! ⛄️ 🎄 🎁 🎅 💝 😀
1,@AndrewSamoylich @Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @grafikhure_de @StevenHardison No; Raptors must be shielded during atmospheric entry. Although; maybe not ...
1,@lexfridman @Tesla @karpathy Thanks; hope you have a good holiday! Your insight on autonomy is excellent.
1,@cleantechnica Sigh
1,@Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @grafikhure_de @StevenHardison Leeward side needs nothing; windward side will be activity cooled with residual (cryo) liquid methane; so will appear liquid silver even on hot side
1,@vicentes @Tesla Glad you’re ok!
1,@grafikhure_de @StevenHardison Starship will look like liquid silver
1,@elliemecham @whatsinside Haha 🤣
1,@Kristennetten @rokosslav @grafikhure_de @StevenHardison Maybe
1,@rokosslav @grafikhure_de @StevenHardison Much less
1,@grafikhure_de @StevenHardison Skin will get too hot for paint. Stainless mirror finish. Maximum relfectivity.
1,@StevenHardison Usable strength/weight of full hard stainless at cryo is slightly better than carbon fiber; room temp is worse; high temp is vastly better

1,@nextPlanetOver @WorldAndScience Which seems to be the approximate pixel size of reality
1,@WorldAndScience Yes! People are almost always surprised to learn that Earth’s gravitational reach is infinite. “Zero gravity” is achieved by zooming around Earth super fast until outward acceleration equals inward acceleration of gravity.
1,Amazing space progress by China. This year they did more orbital launches than the USA for the first time.
1,Engineering is true magic
1,@LeilaniMunter @Tesla @HickoryPD @StephenAtHome @cleanairNC @cleanenergyorg @CMPD How bizarre. Sorry to hear that.

1,@Robotbeat @Jon128123 @Diver2441 @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @_Synders @John_Gardi @martinengwicht @JeromeJaccard @alan1bernard Our superalloy foundry is now almost fully operational. This allows rapid iteration on Raptor.
1,@Robotbeat @Jon128123 @Diver2441 @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @_Synders @John_Gardi @martinengwicht @JeromeJaccard @alan1bernard SpaceX metallurgy team developed SX500 superalloy for 12000 psi; hot oxygen-rich gas. It was hard. Almost any metal turns into a flare in those conditions.
1,@BENBALLER Thanks!
1,@Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @_Synders @John_Gardi @martinengwicht @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard It’s embarrassing that Boeing/Lockheed need to use a Russian engine on Atlas; but that engine design is brilliant
1,@Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @_Synders @John_Gardi @martinengwicht @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard You def don’t want electric pumps on a rocket engine! Raptor turbopumps alone need 100;000 horsepower per engine. That’s not a typo.
1,@Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @_Synders @John_Gardi @martinengwicht @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Yes; full flow; gas-gas; staged combustion. Will take us time to work up to 300 bar. That is a mad level.
1,@NASASpaceflight @_Synders @John_Gardi @martinengwicht @Erdayastronaut @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Yes. Radically redesigned Raptor ready to fire next month.
1,@Erdayastronaut @ludan27 @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Seriously! We are just on the wrong planet for SSTO. Mars; no problem.
1,@_Synders @John_Gardi @martinengwicht @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Starlink V1 on Falcon; V2+ on Starship. Basically; all future products will contain either the word “star” or “link” 😀
1,@ludan27 @Erdayastronaut @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Yes; but single stage to orbit with no payload is pointless. Add Super Heavy rocket booster &amp; orbital payload is gigantic. Only need booster on Earth; due to deep gravity well &amp; thick atmosphere. Starship alone on moons &amp; Mars.
1,@John_Gardi @martinengwicht @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Coldformed at cryo
1,@Malcolmmarsman @TheMuddySchmuck @martinengwicht @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard This test hopper is at full body diameter of 9m / 30 ft; just not full height. Super Heavy will be full height &amp; diameter.
1,@thescalex @Jonas123denmark @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Exactly
1,@martinengwicht @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard For sheet/plate; at supplier made to our spec. For cast; in our Hawthorne foundry.
1,@Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard I will do a full technical presentation of Starship after the test vehicle we’re building in Texas flies; so hopefully March/April
1,@Erdayastronaut @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard While there are some material similarities; Starship is very different from the Atlas design
1,@Erdayastronaut @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Stainless steel is correct; but different mixture of alloys &amp; new architecture. Unlike Atlas; Starship is buckling stable on launchpad even when unpressurized.
1,@wangmeister If Tesla committed delivery &amp; customer made good faith efforts to receive before year end; Tesla will cover the tax credit difference
1,@wangmeister It will be tight; but Tesla production should have all mid-range Model 3 orders delivered by year end
1,@MikeKasprzik @Tesla Try connecting to WiFi
1,Tesla has released all cars for sale where original customer can’t take delivery before year end; as well as test drive / display cars; which cost less.  Reminder to US buyers that $7500 tax credit drops in half in 8 days. Order online at https://t.co/46TXqRrsdr or visit stores.

1,@JohnKasich Thanks; will consider next year
1,@nichegamer @boringcompany So long as the tunnels are spaced about one diameter apart; most of the stress will flow around them; but this won’t matter for the first few layers
1,Tesla phone app release next week will enable service scheduling in 2 mins with a few taps. No more need to call!
1,As a thank you to Tesla short sellers; we named a 💨 after them haha https://t.co/5GCgM4RT4W
1,Perhaps lost in the transport debate is that @boringcompany built a 6000 ft tunnel in LA for ~$10M with V1 (Godot). Next tunnel will be made with V2 (Line-Storm). V3 (Prufrock); aspirationally 10X better; should be operational next year. For reference: https://t.co/LS4EhN57Mw
1,Join our underground movement!
1,@DeadstockNYC Reverse back down (using same roller guide wheels; so no skill required) &amp; tow or flatbed it out
1,@EcoHeliGuy @Erdayastronaut @martinengwicht @realkrauswife @Tesla Autopilot doesn’t need the guide wheels. They’re only there if there is a complete system failure. Turns will definitely be banked in future.
1,Are tunnels safe in an earthquake? https://t.co/vxcZ2Hi2qx
1,@Robotbeat @michaelknaepen @ElSchumi @FredericLambert @boringcompany Exactly
1,@Erdayastronaut @martinengwicht @realkrauswife @Tesla The guides are basically just a wheel; a shock absorber &amp; a solenoid. Costs a few hundred dollars in volume.
1,@MattRemp Yeah; it would allow many streets to become parks and walking areas. Less concrete; more trees.
1,@martinengwicht @realkrauswife Probably only need three types: straight ramp; spiral ramp &amp; elevator. Latter only for tight spaces.
1,@ElSchumi @FredericLambert @boringcompany Passive lateral safety is required by regulators &amp; I think they’re right. Might be able to build this into the tunnel wall though. So long as the vehicle is prevented by physics from rolling or jackknifing; there is probably a good safety argument.
1,@FredericLambert @boringcompany You’re right. We did have a sim ready; but it was confusing; so I didn’t include it. We’re working on one that makes things clear.
1,@realkrauswife Pop up; park and walk!
1,@realkrauswife I know that area well. Best would be to add ramps into the tunnel system from the basement levels of the parking lots surrounding 3rd St.
1,If all vehicles were densely seated buses; throughput in excess of 100;000 people per hour per lane is possible; but better to offer a range of vehicles &amp; let people decide what makes them happy
1,A variety of vehicles; like normal roads; from a small car to a densely seated bus. Must be seated &amp; belted for high speed safety.
1,Next step for @BoringCompany Loop is demonstrating high throughput at high speed. Target is 4000 vehicles/hour at 155mph (250km/h).
1,@joshjob42 @flaneur @boringcompany Precisely
1,Presentation starting at 8:15
1,@CasPiancey @boringcompany This *is* affordable mass transit; but better in that it takes you where and when you to go
1,The demo ride takes you in *same* car on road; down elevator; zips through tunnel using guide wheels; up elevator at destination &amp; then drives on normal roads back to start
1,@flaneur @boringcompany Actually way more capacity; way faster &amp; way more convenient. Subways are fine; but it’s time to upgrade to something better.
1,All Boring Loops will include continuously circulating cars dedicated to pedestrians &amp; cyclists
1,Capable of traveling safely at over 150mph. At that speed; it will feel like teleporting within a city.
1,This can be applied to any autonomous; electric vehicle; not just Tesla
1,Tesla in @boringcompany tunnel with retractable wheel gear that turns a car into a rail-guided train &amp; back again https://t.co/3a6i0NoSmi

1,@businessinsider This part is true. I was trying to explain that we don’t want our cars to have a “tinny” sound. https://t.co/VxO9rR1uAf
1,@John_Papa @Tesla You should def have a loaner. Will take care of it.
1,@Malcolmmarsman Seems likely that we’ll be able to reuse fairings that soft-landed in the ocean. May not need net at all. Would still love to see the catch happen though ⚾️ 👍
1,@business Incorrect. “Chairman” is an honorific; not executive role; which means it’s not needed to run Tesla. Will retire that title at Tesla in 3 years. 60 Mins edited out end of my sentence; where I said I could do whatever I want. They cut “provided I have the support of shareholders”.
1,@annerajb About 10 to 14 days
1,Also; Tesla policy is that if you order a car without a test drive you get 3 days to return for full refund vs 1 day if you do get a test drive (resources are overbooked)
1,Important note for US Tesla buyers: Federal tax credit drops by $3750 in 3 weeks.   To be on the cancellation waitlist for delivery this year or if you want a display car; order at https://t.co/46TXqRJ3C1 or visit our stores. Full refund if Tesla can’t deliver your car this year.
1,@erikstorli No need to wait. It’s super easy to swap the HW2 and HW3 computers. Sensors are the same.
1,@lgebman I’m dying to make a pickup truck so bad … we might have a prototype to unveil next year
1,Love that people are buying a Tesla for the product itself; even if they don’t believe in climate change.   Not everyone can be convinced about global warming; but if an electric car is simply the best product; they don’t need to be.
1,@vincent13031925 @teslectrics @60Minutes @MKBHD Probably next month
1,@teslectrics @60Minutes You’re right. There was a ton of footage with many people at Tesla that would be great to share. Longer pieces like we did with @MKBHD tell a more interesting story.
1,@javagiri @Tesla We’re opening a lot of Tesla service centers next year; including Knoxville. Tesla will post upcoming city opening map this week.
1,@fluffypony @Tesla Probably end of next year
1,@DOfaquarius @ElonsBrain @LiveBit_io @60Minutes So true 🦙💩✨😴
1,@60Minutes This is a very misleading edit. Please post the full transcript where I complete the sentence.
1,@MesQueUnBanjo We are awaiting EU regulatory approval for this release
1,@ghhaugen Full self-driving option is required with the Tesla designed hardware 3 computer. This is a simple plug in replacement for the NVidia computer; but has over 10X the image processing ability.
1,Already testing traffic lights; stop signs &amp; roundabouts in development software. Your Tesla will soon be able to go from your garage at home to parking at work with no driver input at all.
1,If you have a Tesla built in past 2 years; definitely try Navigate on Autopilot. It will blow your mind. Automatically passes slow cars &amp; takes highway interchanges &amp; off-ramps.
1,@danwat1234 It was supposed to be; but that was a dumb decision. In the end; Roadster only had 7% of parts in common with the Lotus Elise or any other car.
1,Major credit to AC Propulsion for the tzero electric sports car 1997-2003 that inspired Tesla Roadster. Without that; Tesla wouldn’t exist or would have started much later. https://t.co/NxCgYO9JXx
1,@nichegamer Yeah; we wanted to name our company after Tesla; the great scientist/engineer; but use of the Tesla name in automotive was already trademarked in the US; Europe &amp; later China.
1,@brandonorselli Buying https://t.co/46TXqRrsdr took over a decade; $11M &amp; amazing amount of effort. Didn’t like https://t.co/BsRfMrY9Gm even when we were only making 🚘.
1,Tesla history trivia: we didn’t actually come up with the Tesla Motors name. Bought trademark off Brad Siewert for $75k in late 2004. He’d originally filed for it in 1994. Our alternative name was Faraday; which was used by a competitor several years later.
1,@Erdayastronaut @TheGledinator @w00ki33 @Teslarati But cool pics of the demo Starship that will fly suborbital hops coming in ~4 weeks
1,@cleantechnica Interesting
1,@Erdayastronaut @TheGledinator @w00ki33 @Teslarati Fairly heavy metal; but extremely strong
1,@Erdayastronaut @TheGledinator @w00ki33 @Teslarati The new design is metal
1,@Erdayastronaut @w00ki33 @Teslarati As far as we know; it’s the largest single piece titanium casting in the world. Major improvement over the old aluminum grid fins; as the titanium doesn’t need heat shielding or even paint.
1,Boring Company product launch on Dec 18. More than a tunnel opening. Will include modded but fully road legal autonomous transport cars &amp; ground to tunnel car elevators.
1,Tracking shot of Falcon water landing https://t.co/6Hv2aZhLjM
1,Engines stabilized rocket spin just in time; enabling an intact landing in water! Ships en route to rescue Falcon. https://t.co/O3h8eCgGJ7
1,@DJSnM Pump is single string. Some landing systems are not redundant; as landing is considered ground safety critical; but not mission critical. Given this event; we will likely add a backup pump &amp; lines.
1,@Dragonmaurizio We may use it for an internal SpaceX mission
1,@markkrieger Yes; cutaway was a mistake. We will show all footage; good or bad.
1,Grid fin hydraulic pump stalled; so Falcon landed just out to sea. Appears to be undamaged &amp; is transmitting data. Recovery ship dispatched.
1,Falcon/Dragon launch to @Space_Station in 9 minutes
1,@mattbeckman Us too sigh
1,Falcon fairing halves missed the net; but touched down softly in the water. Mr Steven is picking them up. Plan is to dry them out &amp; launch again. Nothing wrong with a little swim.
1,64 satellites 🛰 on this flight!
1,@Jennerator211 @PPathole @JohnnaCrider1 We’re adding police car; fire truck &amp; ambulance to the Tesla neural net in coming months
1,@JohnnaCrider1 Exactly. Default Autopilot behavior; if there’s no driver input; is to slow gradually to a stop &amp; turn on hazard lights. Tesla service then contacts the owner. Looking into what happened here.
1,@LittleMissFlint It is so hard to move in armor!
1,@boringcompany You’re all hired!
1,@LittleMissFlint Yes … no … maybe …
1,None shall pass!
1,@bonnienorman @carpenter_maas Good advice
1,@EESNY @teslaownersSV @S100Dfan Applying a hydrophobic coating to the radar (located just below nose of car) should help. Easy to do yourself or Tesla service can do it. We’re also working on vision-only driving.
1,@nikesharora @Tesla Glad you’re ok
1,@carpenter_maas Perhaps most telling is that Norway; which is partly above the Arctic Circle; has more Teslas per capita than any other country on Earth.
1,@carpenter_maas As the battery warms up; almost all of that is recovered. There is a roughly 10% range loss for cabin heating. Cabin heating impact on range is higher in slow traffic; but range is also higher in slow traffic.
1,@johnkrausphotos Incoming rocket &amp; fairing probably visible; but landing itself is over the horizon

1,@nichegamer Haha
1,@pfierens @LikeTeslaKim Prof Dahn is correct (he’s great); but the relative benefit is small. I’d recommend 10% more SoC for convenience.
1,@LikeTeslaKim Not worth going below 80% imo. Even 90% is still fine. Also; no issue going to 5% or lower SoC.

1,@prades_maxime Software upgrade to rain sensing neural net coming next month
1,@NBCNews This is completely backwards. Based on what we’ve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel; we’re moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA. Won’t need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda.
1,You can summon your Tesla from your phone. Only short distances today; but in a few years summon will work from across the continent.
1,Cool! Actually; if you buy a Tesla without a test drive; you have 3 days to return it. If you buy after a test drive; you still have 24 hours. Trying to incent buying with no test drive.

1,@Model3Owners Should be next week
1,@annerajb No; it’s the first or boost stage; analogous to; but much larger than Falcon 9
1,@mwolman98 Later versions will
1,Technically; two parts: Starship is the spaceship/upper stage &amp; Super Heavy is the rocket booster needed to escape Earth’s deep gravity well (not needed for other planets or moons)
1,Renaming BFR to Starship
1,@universal_sci No; we’re just going to accelerate BFR
1,Supercharger V3; which starts rolling out early next year; will also charge much faster
1,Tesla Supercharger capacity will double by end of next year. Expect to be within range of 95% to 100% of population in all active markets.
1,@scottymeuk @ScaleyMurrsuit No; it’s got enough load capacity &amp; volume to carry the battery pack &amp; our current pack energy density is about double that of original Roadster. Still; it would probably only save about 30% to 40% of effort; all things considered.
1,@FredericLambert @frozencanuck @ScaleyMurrsuit In order of resource priority; but not necessarily production ramp; as that depends on thousands of parts &amp; processes; which are extremely difficult to forecast
1,@tsrandall @frozencanuck @ScaleyMurrsuit What really matters is time to volume production; not initial market intro. Apart from brief moments; Tesla vehicle production is limited by total battery output.
1,@frozencanuck @ScaleyMurrsuit Lot on our plate; so it’s either get van gliders (no battery; powertrain or compute tech) from Daimler &amp; produce sooner or do all &amp; produce later. Not a big difference to total vehicles produced either way. Priority list is Model Y; solar roof tiles; pickup; semi; Roadster.
1,@ScaleyMurrsuit Maybe interesting to work with Daimler/Mercedes on an electric Sprinter. That’s a great van. We will inquire.
1,@vincent13031925 @jsteinerman Probably mid 2019
1,@LION_LIFER Tesla can provide heating/cooling/lights/music for days using battery
1,@WillFealey Not everywhere; but should be possible around major metros. Parts supply chain to UK should be fixed. Lmk if not.
1,@acevedo_lex @stars4a_amy @Tesla Should be possible. Please ask service &amp; lmk response.
1,@ajaotj36 No; but perhaps in a few years
1,@stars4a_amy Yeah; good idea. We have that state internally; so can push data to phone app.
1,@jsteinerman Haha; just like Super Troopers
1,@WillFealey Ideal situation in breakdown/accident (assuming no injuries) is that Tesla arrives at scene fast with top-of-the-line service loaner
1,Will allow having your car picked up &amp; dropped off or using mobile Tesla Rangers service vans if car lift isn’t needed
1,Adding functionality to Tesla phone app allowing owners to request service for top issues with 1 or 2 taps
1,@FrameshiftShark Yes; no upgrades planned for F9. Minor tweaks to improve reliability only; provided NASA &amp; USAF are supportive.
1,@FrameshiftShark Radical change
1,Btw; SpaceX is no longer planning to upgrade Falcon 9 second stage for reusability. Accelerating BFR instead. New design is very exciting! Delightfully counter-intuitive.
1,@annerajb It will alert Tesla service automatically as fan power required to achieve target pressure drop exceeds spec level
1,Set air flow to recirculating mode &amp; manually raise blower speed to 5 in Model 3 for best air quality. Air filters are smaller than S/X; so clear air is achieved by circulating through filter several times.
1,Congratulations @BoringCompany on completing the LA/Hawthorne tunnel! Cutting edge technology! https://t.co/80WbSQekCQ
1,Boring Company just broke through the other side!!  https://t.co/4yxQgpPVfZ
1,@nichegamer @PostMalone Missed miku concert sigh
1,Listening to Better Now https://t.co/VyCkLWkRtA
1,@BorisTheBlade02 @KiwiEV China; especially; is doing an amazing job moving towards sustainable energy generation &amp; transport
1,Sure hope this isn’t true. It is the non-linearities; such as Siberian permafrost melting or ocean currents changing; that are most difficult to predict.
1,@_TomCross_ @SpaceX Haha 😀
1,Looking back at the sun from upper stage &amp; Falcon 9 🚀 landed on drone ship Of Course I Still Love You https://t.co/sg3FXIDQJL
1,$5 per min to argue with knight. $12 for 3 min bulk discount.
1,@martinengwicht While (!castle) {brick++};
1,@TheAndwee Watchtower (feat. knight) will be at LA/Hawthorne tunnel entrance
1,Fortnite irl
1,Boring Co is launching a whole product line of DIY watchtowers. You get bricks &amp; a picture.
1,Um; that is not our castle. I just found a picture on the Internet.
1,Not much but it is ours https://t.co/gx2l84M3f7
1,The Boring Company is building a watchtower in LA out of dirt bricks &amp; we need a knight to yell insults at people in a French accent https://t.co/VChOVXXVaz
1,@TechDeals_16 We have to truck to departure rail head &amp; truck from arrival rail head; which is usually from customers. Car gets moved around rail yard a lot too &amp; trains don’t leave often.
1,@vincent13031925 Probably some deliveries in March; but April is more certain
1,Will also be using dedicated roll-on; roll-off fast ships for transporting cars to Europe &amp; Asia in Q1. Major focus on minimizing time from factory to new owner. Did not fully appreciate the working capital impact until recently.
1,@FredericLambert We bought some trucking companies &amp; secured contracts with major haulers to avoid trucking shortage mistake of last quarter
1,@victorpoughon Probably technically able to do so in about a year. Then up to regulators.
1,Skipping rail saves over a month for East Coast deliveries. All things considered; it’s better to use trucks. Single load/unload &amp; direct to owner location.
1,Tesla just acquired trucking capacity to ensure Model 3 can be delivered in US by Dec 31 if ordered by Nov 30 https://t.co/npmPuSXNWC
1,@InsideEVs We will fight Big Tequila!
1,@garos82 @nichegamer That would be awesome
1,@jimmyzhong_iost @SpaceX Easily accessible energy
1,@nichegamer Send me a note!
1,@nichegamer Would be fun to add to Tesla
1,@nextspaceflight @SpaceX @NASA Will try again next month
1,Congratulations @SpaceX team! Thanks @NASA; much appreciated.
1,@_sheateher @MalibuWine Is he ok?
1,It naturally follows that a hotter system will have more energetic events. For example; as a pot of water becomes colder; it becomes inert ice; but heating a pot of water turns it into a steam boiler.
1,@karaswisher Scary sign of times to come. It will get worse.
1,@kenlacovara Agreed; technically; mined hydrocarbons come primarily from ancient; decayed marine organisms &amp; partially from geological processes (CH4 particularly)
1,Makes me so mad when smart; ethical scientists I know are accused of publishing climate papers for “grant money”. They earn 🥜 vs their other opportunities; but give that up to help world. But their accusers make billions by slowing down clean energy. Which is more credible?
1,@SeanGVarney That is true &amp; should be applauded. Right move is for oil companies truly to think of themselves as energy companies; but move rapidly towards clean; sustainable energy. Means lower profits short-term; but will make them stronger long-term.
1,We know we’ll run out of dead dinosaurs to mine for fuel &amp; have to use sustainable energy eventually; so why not go renewable now &amp; avoid increasing risk of climate catastrophe? Betting that science is wrong &amp; oil companies are right is the dumbest experiment in history by far …
1,@zandywithaz Because people on the ground know more about what’s actually needed than politicians do
1,@JackCydia Good; but not hospital grade. S &amp; X were designed to be proof against an actual bioweapon attack. Requires a giant filter with separate acid &amp; alkaline gas neutralization layers. Not enough room in Model 3.
1,If Tesla can help people in California wildfire; please let us know. Model S &amp; X have hospital grade HEPA filters. Maybe helpful for transporting people.
1,@tizmagik @TeslaSupport Fair point; will reenable
1,@mihk101 Agreed; top priority for Autopilot team. Being cautious for max safety.
1,Please lmk what you’d most like improved/fixed about your Tesla. Thanks!
1,@exzacklyright @MKBHD @austinnotduncan @Tesla Cool
1,@Tesla With similar track wheels/tires/brakes; Model S P100D is faster
1,@Tesla Would like to thank Robyn for joining the team. Great respect. Very much look forward to working together.
1,@Erdayastronaut @annerajb No; we’re building a BFR dev ship to do supersonic through landing tests in Boca Chica; Texas
1,@Erdayastronaut @annerajb Won’t land propulsively for those reasons. Ultra light heat shield &amp; high Mach control surfaces are what we can’t test well without orbital entry. I think we have a handle on propulsive landings.
1,@annerajb Aiming for orbital flight by June
1,Mod to SpaceX tech tree build: Falcon 9 second stage will be upgraded to be like a mini-BFR Ship
1,But comments are 👌
1,@Benioff @boringcompany LA/Hawthorne demonstration tunnel activates Dec 10. Runs parallel to 105 freeway from Crenshaw Blvd to 405.

1,@martinengwicht @DatHandsomeJerk @vincent13031925 @Teslarati @panasonic Yes; Germany has outstanding engineering talent
1,@samsheffer Just a few mins; which is mostly accelerating &amp; decelerating
1,So underappreciated
1,Walked full length of Boring Co tunnel under LA tonight. Disturbingly long. On track for opening party Dec 10. Will be very one-dimensional.
1,@_DionnaLeo @CouRageJD What is love?
1,@VampyBitme Fair
1,@TylerGlaiel Yes; that is how
1,We didn’t even have kids back then. Just little sponges.
1,@nichegamer Sea sponge. Humans would later use our bodies to clean dishes. So humiliating.
1,@bonnienorman Wow that’s cool!
1,Kids these days have it easy
1,I remember when I was a sponge. Simpler times they were.
1,@trobbu @Tesla Haha
1,First movie I ever saw in theaters
1,When the only existing life was a sponge
1,Although it was in the precambrian era
1,Star Wars only had an $11M budget. Must have been in the galaxy of ridiculously low budgets. https://t.co/GcRL2uN7J7
1,@Scobleizer @Tesla They’re great! Honored to work with them.
1,@annerajb @vincent13031925 @Teslarati @panasonic Definitely
1,@DatHandsomeJerk @vincent13031925 @Teslarati @panasonic Aspirationally; they will be made to the exact same specification; but we can vary cell quantity to account for empirical variation
1,@annerajb @vincent13031925 @Teslarati @panasonic Hopefully; partial presence in India; Africa &amp; South America end of next year; with broader expansion in 2020
1,@annerajb @vincent13031925 @Teslarati @panasonic Recently asked service team to expand locations to all population regions (not just major metros) in North America; Eastern Europe; China &amp; Japan by end of next year. We are completely missing vast geographic regions in some cases.
1,@vincent13031925 @Teslarati @panasonic To clarify further; the long-term goal for Tesla mass market products is local production for local markets (at least at the continent level). This is critical to make pricing as affordable as possible.
1,@vincent13031925 @Teslarati @panasonic Tesla will manufacture all battery modules &amp; packs at China Giga; as we do today in California &amp; Nevada. Cell production will be sourced locally; most likely from several companies (incl Pana); in order to meet demand in a timely manner.
1,@Teslarati Amazing results by @Panasonic at Tesla Gigafactory Nevada! Very much appreciate extreme hard work it took to achieve this result. Together with Pana Japan cell plants; Tesla/Pana partnership is producing ~60% of global EV battery output!
1,@lsutgr @karaswisher @Recode @DMC_Ryan Prob 2 to 3 weeks

1,@vaipier Long-term; the car will work purely on vision; with radar just a plus; but maybe worth adding a radar heater anyway
1,@raxetul We can make it work from very far away. LoS is just for safety.
1,@sheslulu Hahaha &lt;ahem&gt;
1,@rivatez Um yes
1,@wordcipher Maybe AI will make me follow it; laugh like a demon &amp; say who’s the pet now …
1,Also; you’ll be able to drive it from your phone remotely like a big RC car if in line of sight
1,Car will drive to your phone location &amp; follow you like a pet if you hold down summon button on Tesla app
1,Tesla advanced Summon ready in ~6 weeks! Just an over-the-air software upgrade; so will work on all cars made in past 2 years (Autopilot hardware V2+).
1,Scientists uncover Sneaky move by GM
1,@rarelyserious @Tesla For those unfamiliar; this uses Tesla Autopark/Summon. Slightly smarter version hopefully ready soon. By next year; a Tesla should be able to drive around a parking lot; find an empty spot; read signs to confirm it’s valid &amp; park.
1,@rarelyserious @Tesla Cool haha
1,Legally required officers of a corporation are president; treasurer &amp; secretary. Guess I have to keep 1st one or it will confuse the authorities.

1,Deleted my Tesla titles last week to see what would happen. I’m now the Nothing of Tesla. Seems fine so far.
1,@SnazzyQ @FredericLambert Signing off Twitter for a few days ...
1,@SnazzyQ @FredericLambert Don’t worry; we’ll make it right
1,@CGasparino @Tesla The FOIA on this will be solid gold. Can’t wait.
1,@Model3Owners Not going up. We will just offer those who ordered bought 3P either $5k back or free lifetime Supercharging.
1,@Lindowitz @FredericLambert It’s a reasonable criticism. We wanted to make the awesome version of Model 3 Performance more affordable; but it was arguably too much too soon. Taking corrective action …
1,@CGasparino @Tesla Exactly; this is total bs. What part of “production hell” sounds like a sure thing!?
1,@sk2sno @rtk86 @sheldonth @FactsDataTruth @Tesla We will enable track mode for all performance cars
1,@rtk86 @sheldonth @FactsDataTruth @Tesla Ok; we will turn off lifetime free Supercharging and give you $5k refund
1,@ctgm @FredericLambert Yeah; or free lifetime Supercharging; whichever you prefer
1,@FredericLambert Didn’t you get free Supercharging for life? Current buyers don’t get that.
1,@annerajb @FredericLambert @pjj_knowles @yames51 @DigitalDunzey Exactly. That’s Monday.
1,@officialjaden Yes. Will require tapping indicator to confirm at first. When safety looks good after 10M miles of driving or so; there will be an option to turn off confirm.
1,@pjj_knowles @yames51 @DigitalDunzey No; but I will
1,@mangeHDbackup Isn’t it obvious?
1,@yames51 @DigitalDunzey Worth it
1,@vincent13031925 @cleantechnica @CNBC @businessinsider @business @WSJ @Teslarati @InsideEVs True
1,Tesla Autopilot Drive on Navigation going to wide release in North America tonight
1,@sheldonth @FactsDataTruth @Tesla Not exactly. We just bundled the upgrade package into Performance. No problem if you want to return the car; but I think lifetime free Supercharging is a good deal.
1,@fb1975 @DigitalDunzey Haha
1,@DigitalDunzey On Insta; 10% of followers like even lame posts. On Twitter; good posts get 1%.
1,@nichegamer @raissabontempo @SomeGrayAreas @reddit @Twitter Reddit is massive; but def has gems
1,@SomeGrayAreas @reddit @Twitter Reddit’s twitter account is lame; because it’s not real Reddit
1,@Mcgillligan Exactly
1,@FactsDataTruth @Tesla You’re right. Earlier Model 3 Performance buyers got free lifetime Supercharging. Will add that to anyone who bought recently.
1,On Twitter; likes are rare &amp; criticism is brutal. So hardcore. It’s great.
1,Glad you’re ok @tylerthecreator  https://t.co/ie4yBMw0tW

1,@mikearildbrown @MartyHungerford Same
1,How’d they know!? https://t.co/AZh4EOrgmc
1,@MartyHungerford Around mid 2019
1,@houmanhemmati @FredericLambert There have been hundreds of improvements to fit &amp; finish over the years; but no major step change in this regard. Seats; especially; are dramatically better now than in the past.
1,@FredericLambert Only thing almost anyone would notice is the nose
1,Get this question a lot; so need to clarify that there’s no such thing as a Tesla “refresh”. Other car companies do this every ~3 years; but Tesla constantly upgrades vehicle hardware every week.
1,To simplify production; many Tesla Model S &amp; X interior configs; will no longer be available after Nov 1. Order now to be sure of the one you want.
1,@cleantechnica Model 3 body design could def be less complex; but; yes; most of weight difference is due to higher safety vs other cars

1,@planet4589 If you don’t like a Tesla for any reason or no reason; you can just give it back for a full refund
1,Model 3 long range; rear wheel drive is still available for ordering off menu for another week or so
1,@dennishegstad It’s kind of like the post office. Same price for delivery to Maine as the SF Bay Area. But you do get a free Tesla factory tour; which is really fun to see.
1,Tesla rear wheel drive cars do actually work well on snow &amp; ice. We did our traction testing on an ice lake! Dual motor AWD is great; but not required for cold weather. Just don’t use sport/summer tires.
1,@DannyMekic It’s a long range battery with fewer cells. Non-cell portion of the pack is disproportionately high; but we can get it done now instead of ~February
1,Just released lower cost; mid-range Tesla Model 3 &amp; super simple new order page https://t.co/cz0TQn7IOZ

1,@smeranda Yes; aiming for next few months
1,@ajmarquez True; but this will improve dramatically over next several months &amp; all Tesla cars ever produced (except early Roadsters) will get improvements for free. Continuous; free over-the-air software updates is a big part of why a Tesla retains so much value over time.
1,Same goes for all countries within which we officially operate by end of next year
1,Just reviewed Tesla’s service locations in North America &amp; realized we have major gaps in geographic coverage! Sorry for this foolish oversight. Tesla will aim to cover all regions of NA (not just big cities) within 3 to 6 months.
1,Insightful article by David @Pogue
1,@ID_AA_Carmack Thanks John; really admire you too! I think you’re one of the best engineers ever. Hope you return to working on rockets one day.
1,@JacksMacintosh @SmileSimplify @j_brorsson @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert The FSD upgrade is the Tesla computer with our NN chip
1,@SmileSimplify @j_brorsson @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert I believe it’s $5k
1,@SmileSimplify @j_brorsson @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert ~6 months before it is in all new production cars. No change to sensors. This is simple replacement of the Autopilot computer. Will be done free of charge for those who ordered full self-driving.
1,@j_brorsson @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Somewhere between 500% &amp; 2000%
1,@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert To be clear; actual NN improvement is significantly overestimated in this article. V9.0 vs V8.1 is more like a ~400% increase in useful ops/sec due to enabling integrated GPU &amp; better use of discrete GPU.
1,@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert This is without the Tesla NN computer. Per my public comments; that will give the car an extra order of magnitude.
1,@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Still a long way to go
1,Model 3 motor &amp; gearbox still in good condition after driving 1M miles. Designed for ultra high endurance.

1,@FredericLambert No such thing as a “full refresh” at Tesla or even a model year. Our cars are partially upgraded every month as soon as a new subsystem is ready for production. There is no cadence.
1,@wonderofscience It sure does. Very reliable.

1,@MebFaber When something sounds too good to be true; it usually is. Way the trick works is companies like Blackrock keep up to 50% of short interest revenue; but suffer almost none of equity decline; as they’re just “passive” managers. Blackrock made $597M in short lending last year!
1,@MebFaber Not all. However; shorting applied to market as a whole is obv net negative — it incents negative gdp! Moreover; it stops private companies from going public; preventing access by retirement funds &amp; small investors; thus increasing wealth divide. https://t.co/7jk2Bs56HR
1,@Model3Owners V9 moving to wide release now. Holding back Autopilot drive on navigation for a few more weeks of validation. Extremely difficult to achieve a general solution for self-driving that works well everywhere.
1,@mgerrydoyle Only if they’re extremely tiny
1,Tesla owners can refer someone to buy a Tesla &amp; get any image they want laser etched in glass &amp; sent to deep space for millions of years
1,First Falcon 9 land landing mission from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California coming up soon!
1,@annerajb @KishavanBhola @enn_nafnlaus @ElonBachman The CIO of a major pension fund is the one who deserves credit for uncovering this scam
1,@annerajb @KishavanBhola @enn_nafnlaus @ElonBachman The big funds can &amp; will; as they’re suffering a net loss. Index managers like Blackrock pocket make excessive profit from short lending while pretending to charge low rates for “passive” index tracking.
1,@dlauer @KishavanBhola @enn_nafnlaus @ElonBachman Debatably true; if applied to individual stocks selectively &amp; consciously; but obv false if applied broadly to most of the market &amp; without clear consent of the shareholder
1,@KishavanBhola @enn_nafnlaus @ElonBachman Where this breaks down is in passive index funds; which constitute most of the market. The holders of those funds; mostly small investors &amp; retirement funds; don’t realize that their stocks are being lent to short sellers; diminishing their true equity return.
1,@KishavanBhola @enn_nafnlaus @ElonBachman There is no rational basis for a long holder to lend their stock to shorts; as it dilutes the shareholder base &amp; gives the short a strong incentive to attack the company by whatever means possible; including regulators
1,@Erdayastronaut I hope to be less wrong over time
1,@FlintSchools @MuskFoundation You’re most welcome. Hope to do more to help in the future.
1,What they do should be illegal
1,The last several years have taught me that they are indeed reasonably maligned
1,@FCalciu @derekGUMB @Scobleizer @Tesla @SEC_Enforcement Exactly. Short-sellers are value destroyers. Should definitely be illegal.
1,By revenue; taking publicly available selling prices; Model 3 actually outsold Camry by a factor of two https://t.co/1ZTDk8HvJh
1,@dailystem @LFlemingEDU @atkauffman @JustinAglio @TheTechRabbi @smgaillard @jsnhubbard @mrnavas @WickedDecent @gregkulowiec This is amazing https://t.co/zNaE8p2nHs
1,@Model3Owners Almost ready. We expanded the early access program to 1000 more users a few days ago.
1,People sometimes forget that a company is just a group of people gathered together to make products. So long as it makes great products; it will have great value.
1,@BullTesla @iavor If you think Tesla is overvalued compared to probable value of future cash flows; sell. Otherwise; buy.
1,@Scobleizer @Tesla True
1,@Scobleizer @Tesla Sorry about the typo. That was unforgivable. Why would they be upset about their mission? It’s what they do.
1,Just want to that the Shortseller Enrichment Commission is doing incredible work. And the name change is so on point!
1,Great verdict 😀
1,@scottwww @cleantechnica Could be worse 😇
1,Naughty by Nature 😉 https://t.co/muZdxJWjyZ
1,@krobertson @Tesla @kimbal @senorsisig Will do. Definitely moving heavily towards direct to work/home delivery of cars!
1,@alitofts @telsa @6pm Tesla will deliver your car to you. This is the future. The way it should work.
1,That was intense
1,@Model3Owners !! Will take action.
1,And remember … https://t.co/UaDUv4OlZf
1,Huge thank you to all Tesla supporters for helping with car deliveries all around the world. You rock!!
1,Sorry for difficulties delivering your Tesla due to high volume! Critical to show that environmentally sustainable is financially sustainable.
1,@scottwww @Tesla Pace of innovation is all that matters in the long run
1,@ctbarker32 @BDL3J @Tesla You’re welcome. Sorry for the delay!
1,@Agent_KO @Starflightgame @SpaceX @starcontrolgame What would be great is original Elite
1,@neveryb Going over final tweaks tonight. Hopefully in wide release end of week.
1,♥️ Tesla Owners ♥️
1,@ParkerWoolfolk Increased tire pressure improves range. Also; if you have performance tires; they are stickier. Better handling; but slightly lower range.
1,@ctbarker32 Apologies; we’re upgrading our logistics system; but running into an extreme shortage of car carrier trailers. Started building our own car carriers this weekend to alleviate load.
1,@slashdot Tricky one
1,@DMC_Ryan Wow; thanks for offering to help! The coming week is incredibly intense. If any current Tesla owners who’d like to help educate new owners could head to Tesla delivery centers during midday on Sat/Sun &amp; morning/evening on weekdays; that would be super appreciated!
1,@NASASpaceflight Probably 2028 for a base to be built
1,@LanceUlanoff Consider an ice skater. Same weight; but spins/turns much faster with arms in vs arms out. Same principle is true for a car.
1,@LanceUlanoff Front vs rear wheel weight distribution; though commonly asked; isn't the right question. You can have 50% on front; 50% on rear &amp; still have poor handling if mass elements are far from center. Dumbbell mass distribution is bad; spinning top/dreidel is good.
1,@LanceUlanoff Simple explanation of polar moment of inertia &amp; other important car terms at https://t.co/CftQ1v9YCL
1,@LanceUlanoff Key technical point is that the polar moment of inertia (concentration of mass around center) of a Tesla; to the extent of our knowledge; is better than any other production car. This positively affects safety; handling &amp; driving feel. Extremely important metric.
1,@martinengwicht @BlondesE A car propelled by combustion is far more likely to combust than an electric car
1,@LanceUlanoff Yes; when it comes to physics; make sure Newton is on your side
1,@LanceUlanoff Helps improve forward crumple zone length; especially important in high speed frontal impacts; and moments of inertia in side impacts
1,Tesla piece on the physics of car safety coming soon for those interested in technical details
1,@MartenBenjamin @NHTSAgov @Tesla Exactly; all 5 star are *not* the same; as the videos show. “5 star” just means a car met a certain threshold; but injury probability stats (real numbers) tell you by how much.
1,@Cardoso @NHTSAgov Haha true
1,.@NHTSAgov will post final safety probability stats soon. Model 3 has a shot at being safest car ever tested.
1,@primadanna @Tesla @alphacali Wow; glad they’re ok!
1,@vicentes @DanAloni @slashdot Physics can be thought of as the compression algorithms of reality
1,@CJDaniels77 31 engines; but with room to add 11 more down the road. Kinda have to.
1,@JaneidyEve @slashdot Yes; if there is no listener; a simulation probably wouldn’t spend computing power on sound
1,True 😀 https://t.co/CS6semhKm6
1,@slashdot To conserve computing power; a simulation would only render an object when it is observed
1,@megangale @Tesla You’re most welcome! Sorry for the delay.
1,@Erdayastronaut Will do. Love Reddit.
1,@Cardoso @SoundBoy264 Space Bar
1,@JaneidyEve @ds23ytube Long-term; there will be thousands and eventually; hopefully; millions of missions &amp; anyone will be able to go
1,@perthguppy Yeah; Starlink should be active by then
1,@LisaPadgett @bocio777 @TArkesteijn Sorry! So many bots!!
1,Moon mission will be livestreamed in high def VR; so it’ll feel like you’re there in real-time minus a few seconds for speed of light
1,@bocio777 Perhaps one of the invited artists choosing to play. There will be no obligation to do so.
1,@ryaneshaghi Very close
1,@JamesMarstersOf @bioshock Always
1,@yousuck2020 @SpaceX That’s the first BFR airframe/tank barrel section made of a new carbon fiber material
1,@MKBHD Yeah … that’s exactly how I feel. However it happens; I just hope it does.
1,@yousuck2020 Thanks for helping fund a rocket &amp; spaceship that could take humanity beyond Earth!
1,Hanging out with @yousuck2020 before the @SpaceX moon mission announcement https://t.co/RTOwutzMtG
1,Yusaku will be bringing 8 (brave) artists &amp; cultural figures with him on the journey around the moon!
1,@martinengwicht @iamacloudguy @Model3Owners Probably V10 alpha build
1,@DMC_Ryan @iamacloudguy @Model3Owners Yes; albeit a beta version. Will improve with V9.1.
1,@iamacloudguy @Model3Owners Good news on this front. Tesla engineering rallied &amp; this will be part of V9. Going through final testing now.
1,Thank you for your trust in the @SpaceX team. Greatly appreciated.
1,@cleantechnica Will be interesting to see how this evolves over time
1,@NigelKBaker Will see what we can do. Really need to bring this program to an end while being as fair as possible. It’s not sustainable long-term.
1,@martinengwicht Very interesting
1,Due to some Tesla owners encountering system issues yesterday; the free Supercharging referral program will be extended until tomorrow night
1,@beardyman This is definitely worth thoughtful debate. What might we do differently to improve human/life happiness?
1,@LanceUlanoff @SpaceX @NASA Yes; I do
1,Top SpaceX priority is and will remain supporting @NASA crewed spaceflight and National Security missions
1,Btw; can’t emphasize enough how @SpaceX would not be where it is today without @NASA. Thank you.

1,@FalconGridFin Good catch. They are there in the flight design; but we forgot to put them in this render.
1,@vicentes Forward moving wing
1,@megangale @Tesla Sorry; we’ve gone from production hell to delivery logistics hell; but this problem is far more tractable. We’re making rapid progress. Should be solved shortly.
1,@RoxanaDaneshjou @boringcompany Awesome 😎
1,@johnkoetsier Design has been changed so the 🚀 lands on legs that extend from the tips of the three fins; two of which actuate (mostly for pitch control)
1,@nirbheek Sorry; it’s not really sustainable at volume production &amp; doesn’t incent optimal behavior. We probably should have ended this earlier.
1,@thereal_scottv Yeah; that’s our problem. Service &amp; parts supply in general will be the top Tesla priority after we get through the insane car delivery logistics of the next few weeks.
1,Goal is for repaired car to be better than before accident. Should always be true if damaged/used parts are correctly replaced with newer parts.
1,Exciting to see some Tesla collision repair operations already completing within 24 hrs. Aiming for same day soon; then under an hour.
1,Tesla is bringing most collision repairs in-house; as outside firms take weeks to months for repairs; driving Tesla owners (and us) crazy

1,@FredericLambert @pooktd The multi-coat colors (pearl white &amp; red) are hardest; red especially; as it has red tint in the clear coat layer itself for depth &amp; complexity

1,@McMurchie @alexmd2 @Techmeme @CatherineShu At this point; I want ETH even if it is a scam

1,@GrowthHackers This is why a small company with tight focus &amp; high energy can beat a big company without
1,@SeanHQuinn @yanquetino @Tesla This is utterly false. Fossil fuel merchants of doubt have been pushing that bs for years. Tesla Gigafactory will be 100% renewable powered (by Tesla Solar) by end of next year.
1,@yanquetino @Tesla Most people don’t realize that the cost of operating an electric vehicle is much lower than a gas car. Electricity is way cheaper than gas plus no oil changes; tune-ups;smog checks &amp; other service costs.
1,@j_brorsson @InsideEVs @Tesla @AirResources Most major customers have tried it &amp; love it. Now we need to finish production design &amp; build it; while avoiding dumb mistakes made with Model 3 production system. Wish it wasn’t so hard to be less stupid over time …
1,@InsideEVs @Tesla @AirResources Maybe …
1,@AskDrStupid This was key showstopper for me personally. Couldn’t make it happen; even through expert fiduciary SPV; without creating exotic trust structure that would prob not be accepted by regulators. Current rules have good intentions; but make wealth creation harder for small investors.
1,@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert The extension cord was 1000 miles long; but still
1,@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert What’s cool is that it was driven across the country alone (no escort or any accompanying vehicles); using the existing Tesla Supercharger network and an extension cord
1,@Tesla In talking to our public investors; most were supportive of optimizing for long-term value creation over quarterly earnings. This was also a factor in remaining public.

1,@appljd Great!
1,@appljd We’ve gone from ~1000 S/X deliveries per week in US last year to ~6000 S/3/X. It’s like hitting a square wave.
1,@appljd We’re trying to get rid of contracts completely. Should just be “tap here &amp; you get your car”. Then; if you don’t like it for any reason; just return it like any other product.
1,@westcoastbill Yeah. Never seen it so high ever.
1,@WillFealey @Tesla @TeslaOwnersUK Wow; that’s really awesome. Thank you! ♥️@TeslaOwnersUK
1,@arstechnica Haha
1,@ElectrekCo Only costs that actually apply to Q3 &amp; beyond will be counted. It would not be correct to apply historical cost savings to current quarter.

1,@Hyperloop @SpaceX Congratulations to all teams in the student @Hyperloop competition! To make high-speed pods that can operate in vacuum is very difficult. Was great to meet everyone!
1,@huby @87spider @ryan_caldbeck @Tesla Exactly. Overheat protection is always on; but you can also tap “maintain” &amp; your car will hold a cool or warm temp for a few hours while parked.
1,@ryan_caldbeck @Tesla Yes; Tesla Model S; X &amp; 3 all automatically keep cabin temperature within safe limits even when parked https://t.co/yVkWQfPlbm
1,@AntVenom @Ca_via_GreenBay Makes me very sad indeed; but also the fault is mine by far

1,@AntVenom It is much better
1,@JD_2020 Sorry 🤗
1,@MitchellRossman @danfromtheweb I love that scene
1,@danfromtheweb I made that up tbh. They did not have phones during the French Revolution. They used Friendster.
1,@danfromtheweb Don’t make me bite my thumb at you
1,@JaneidyEve For sure
1,@danfromtheweb Btw; 1792 is calling &amp; wants its method of execution back. Seriously; what museum do you plan to raid?
1,@annerajb @boringcompany Yeah; great point. Underground power lines would clear up the skyline; be safer to service; have better uptime &amp; save lives of many birds.
1,No kidding
1,@annerajb @danfromtheweb Yes; that will probably be its first use
1,@danfromtheweb Phew 😅. Yeah; we had a drain block 3 months ago &amp; people are working hard to make Tesla successful. Am honored to work with them. Are you trolling for fun or is it part of a job? What motivates you?
1,@danfromtheweb I apologized. Do you stand by your guillotine statement or not?
1,@danfromtheweb Figuratively; literally or both?
1,@annerajb @Flyfiddlesticks @patrickc @stevesi This chart only shows globally competed commercial launches; not US government missions. “Other US” refers to Boeing &amp; Lockheed. Their skill at obtaining govt contracts &amp; subsidies vastly exceeds ours.
1,@vincent13031925 @bonnienorman @Jason @scottwww Dunno where this bs is coming from. Who knows about the future; but last week we had over 2000 S/X and 5000 Model 3 *new* net orders.
1,@DMC_Ryan Definitely. We gave up some grip &amp; width in exchange for range. Would recommend stickier tires &amp; wider on rear for best performance. You might get 3.3 sec 0-60 mph or better with optimized rims &amp; tires.
1,Thanks Dan; you are a tough reviewer; so this means a lot coming from you. Please lmk even smallest nuance that can be improved.
1,@MarkeR2002 @kevinbusch @Paracidic @otgray310 Wow; someone has really thought about this!

1,@adamchavez As this well-written article suggests; my words were spoken in anger after Mr. Unsworth said several untruths &amp; suggested I engage in a sexual act with the mini-sub; which had been built as an act of kindness &amp; according to specifications from the dive team leader.
1,@lrroberts87 Good point
1,@nealboudette @BertelSchmitt @AmazingChevVolt I have never donated to a SuperPAC
1,@danielbrennan Yes; about 0.5% of what I donated to @SierraClub; which is a reasonable amount to maintain an open dialogue
1,Reports that I am a top donor to GOP are categorically false. I am not a top donor to any political party.
1,Thank you for fighting climate change. This affects every living creature on Earth. https://t.co/mm0cpaQLsn
1,@jack_p That said; I do not actually see the checks (changed that policy today). A nominal annual amount goes out automatically to both parties to maintain dialogue. I have given vastly more to humanitarian causes.
1,@stfuszn @jack_p So that they are willing to listen when I call to object about issues that negatively affect humanity
1,@jack_p Thanks Jack. To be clear; I am not a conservative. Am registered independent &amp; politically moderate. Doesn’t mean I’m moderate about all issues. Humanitarian issues are extremely important to me &amp; I don’t understand why they are not important to everyone.

1,@hohocho Would love to. It’s been too long.
1,@aparanjape Prob early next year

1,So true https://t.co/DLagzIxyHm
1,@Vivek_17m @thanr The pumps I saw were running v high flow rate all the way from cave 3. They stopped shortly after boys were rescued &amp; water level rose to roof level all way back to cave 1. That was great work.
1,@thanr Sounds good
1,@thanr Glad to hear that. Engineering team also getting feedback from the British dive team on how to improve the design for future applications.
1,@vissmeerr @ArsenalDem @pvols1979 @CNET It will happen for sure. Damn.
1,@ArsenalDem @pvols1979 @CNET Lots of fake accounts on Twitter characterized by high following/follower ratio to make it seem like many real people when it isn’t. Wonder why.
1,@tammyharrington @d20_highroller Damn; now I want donuts 🍩
1,@d20_highroller Yeah
1,@shplatt @StarFire2258 Good point. Maybe use non-plumbers with work inspected/approved by pros.
1,@StarFire2258 You’re right on both counts. Most houses in Flint have safe water; but they’ve lost faith in govt test results. Some houses are still outliers. Will organize a weekend in Flint to add filters to those houses with issues &amp; hopefully fix perception of those that are actually good.
1,@jonodiener Maybe rewarding to organize a barnstorming weekend for water filter installation?
1,@jonodiener For now; reply to my tweet with ppm &amp; ppb test results &amp; will send someone to install a water filter. Creating email flint@x.com; but I’m in China so that won’t be working until tomorrow.
1,@DylanSheaMusic Please consider this a commitment that I will fund fixing the water in any house in Flint that has water contamination above FDA levels. No kidding.
1,@jack Great move
1,@vanschneider Why sir … 😊
1,Stockholm: it’s not just a syndrome
1,@KirklandJones Good point

1,Catching rocket fairings falling from space has proven tricky; so we made the net really big https://t.co/WMeNZeksRq
1,@Katheri93719178 @dtemkin Yes. Caves are now filled with water again. Difficulty of passage is massively dependent on water level. Little kids can walk/swim in when low; but it can be deadly to pro divers when high. Pump &amp; generator engineering team deserves some credit for the rescue.
1,@JohnnaSabri @dtemkin It sometimes feels like reality is a moral filter. I suppose that is what religion tells us. Wonder what I should do differently.
1,@RockyPruitt @kulpability @DonAndrewBailey @haydentiff @TheFerris_Wheel @100K_Ideas @GotchuW Makes a lot of sense
1,@dtemkin This reaction has shaken my opinion of many people. We were asked to create a backup option &amp; worked hard to do so. Checked with dive team many times to confirm it was worthwhile. Now it’s there for anyone who needs it in future. Something’s messed up if this is not a good thing.
1,@hankgreen @eehouls Thanks for correcting me. I meant to say over half a million people.
1,@DonAndrewBailey @haydentiff @TheFerris_Wheel @100K_Ideas @GotchuW Please lmk contamination levels of any kind when you test the water
1,@DonAndrewBailey @TheFerris_Wheel @100K_Ideas @GotchuW Please lmk results of your water tests
1,@DonAndrewBailey @TheFerris_Wheel @100K_Ideas @GotchuW When you’re there next week; are you planning to test water sources for lead?
1,@DMC_Ryan Should be very soon. We’ve already made around 100 Model 3 Performance cars for test drives in stores.
1,@bevvscott @eehouls Exactly
1,@eehouls No; it means I created jobs for 50;000 people directly and; through parts suppliers &amp; supporting professions; ~250;000 people indirectly; thus supporting half a million families. What have you done?
1,@HelloCullen Already have
1,@blake_kistler @BBCWorld Ironically; the “billionaire” label; when used by media; is almost always meant to devalue &amp; denigrate the subject. I wasn’t called that until my companies got to a certain size; but reality is that I still do the same science &amp; engineering as before. Just the scale has changed.
1,@LanceUlanoff @BBCWorld Good for rescuing vulnerable patients in dangerous environments; particularly if water; toxic gas or dangerous bacteria/viruses present; as patient would remain dry &amp; at std air pressure entire time.
1,@Sarthk007 @BBCWorld Yes; it was specifically designed to pass that point
1,@BBCWorld Moreover; based on extensive cave video review &amp; discussion with several divers who know journey; SpaceX engineering is absolutely certain that mini-sub can do entire journey &amp; demonstrate at any time.
1,@BBCWorld The former Thai provincial governor (described inaccurately as “rescue chief”) is not the subject matter expert. That would be Dick Stanton; who co-led the dive rescue team. This is our direct correspondence: https://t.co/dmC9l3jiZR
1,Great news that they made it out safely. Congratulations to an outstanding rescue team!
1,Just returned from Cave 3. Mini-sub is ready if needed. It is made of rocket parts &amp; named Wild Boar after kids’ soccer team. Leaving here in case it may be useful in the future. Thailand is so beautiful. https://t.co/EHNh8ydaTT
1,@Noizey_Man @JaneidyEve That would be cool. I wonder what it’s like under all that ice.
1,@EnochKo @Anna_online A second one that is 30cm shorter is almost complete
1,@JaneidyEve Yes. Those videos are from this morning.
1,@Anna_online According to divers who have made the passage; yes. However; we also made an exact replica that is inflatable; so that the entire path can be tested without risk of blockage.
1,Simulating maneuvering through a narrow passage https://t.co/2z01Ut3vxJ
1,@2morrowknight Thanks; but we’ve not done anything useful yet. It is all other people.
1,@bweikle According to divers who have made the journey; this is capable of maneuvering through all passages
1,@JaneidyEve Mini-sub arriving in about 17 hours. Hopefully useful. If not; perhaps it will be in a future situation.
1,Thanks @palicharterhigh for letting us use your pool
1,@imscoops It is an honor to work with them
1,With some mods; this could also work as an escape pod in space
1,@IAmJohnMcMahon I want to know who is running the Etherium scambots! Mad skillz …
1,@DocJohnG @PewellaClarke @dcliem It is both alarming &amp; explanatory that you run a psych ward
1,@KyleBrubaker Diver weight belts wrapped around outside. Mini-sub only weighs ~40kg dry; so easy to carry on long dry sections of cave; then add weight belts for wet sections.
1,@PPathole @JimmyVosika @dcliem Yeah; that sounds cool. Music makes things better. Calms the mind. Adding padded wall pockets for a hand radio &amp; phone/music player.
1,@astrography__ @dcliem Aluminum shell has high thermal conductivity; so will be close to ambient. If ambient is cold; a thin layer of neoprene insulation around interior will keep occupant warm.
1,@dcliem Buoyancy adjusted by strapping diver weight belts around body of capsule. They’re prevented from sliding off by the 6 diver handhold attachments.
1,@MontanaSeptic @dcliem Testing for 3 more hours in LA; then it’s on a plane to Thailand
1,@dcliem Design based on dive team feedback (primarily Stanton): 4 air / oxygen ports front &amp; rear; front ports protected by nosecone. Dual O-ring seal on acrylic rear plate with clear view of occupant head. Leak/buckling proof to 10X cave water pressure.
1,@vcastillo630 @adblanche I am an engineer
1,@annerajb @kulpability @sivarajkumar237 @KO_Sulli @Grady_Booch @slashdot Tight control code is always C
1,@annerajb @sivarajkumar237 @KO_Sulli @Grady_Booch @slashdot Python is done right. Great name story too.
1,@DocJohnG @dcliem If I am a narcissist (which might be true); at least I am a useful one
1,@dcliem Pretty close. There is a nosecone on the front to protect against rocks impacting fwd air hoses with a hole on the side for hoses to exit.
1,@ayshardzn Given Chiang Rai airport hours; soonest we could’ve departed US was an hour ago; but cave now closed for diver rescue. Will continue testing in LA in case needed later or for somewhere else in future.
1,@DowdEdward Will do. Even if not useful here; perhaps it will be in a future situation.
1,Extremely talented dive team. Makes sense given monsoon. Godspeed. https://t.co/t5XRo3gTxK
1,@JelteDesign @maysacha Fitted for a kid or small adult to minimize open air. Segmented compartments to place rocks or dive weights &amp; adjust bouyancy.
1,@maysacha 4 handles/hitch points on front &amp; 4 on rear. 2 air tank connections on front &amp; 2 on rear; allowing 1 to 4 tanks simultaneously connected; all recessed for impact protection w secondary cap seal if leak develops.
1,@thanr @ablack82 I’m in LA working with the SpaceX team building the kid mini-sub
1,@aiyanaskye Construction complete in about 8 hours; then 17 hour flight to Thailand
1,Continue to be amazed by the bravery; resilience &amp; tenacity of kids &amp; diving team in Thailand. Human character at its best.
1,Got more great feedback from Thailand. Primary path is basically a tiny; kid-size submarine using the liquid oxygen transfer tube of Falcon rocket as hull. Light enough to be carried by 2 divers; small enough to get through narrow gaps. Extremely robust.
1,@VoltzCoreAudio Ground winds would
1,@VoltzCoreAudio Yes. All-weather. ~300km/h high altitude winds. ~60km/h ground winds. It’s a beast.
1,@jevjack1 Can’t be too buoyant
1,Some good feedback from cave experts in Thailand. Iterating with them on an escape pod design that might be safe enough to try. Also building an inflatable tube with airlocks. Less likely to work; given tricky contours; but great if it does.
1,@ArkadiuszKula @JL2579 @MattyIce4412 @thanr @JamesWorldSpace Good idea
1,@JL2579 @MattyIce4412 @thanr @JamesWorldSpace Prob wise to add an air tank (butt end fwd to take impacts) in nose of pod &amp; vent valve in rear. Set air tank to slow bleed rate; then no need for SCUBA mouthpiece or regulator. Training unnecessary &amp; less susceptible to panic attack.
1,@LittleMissFlint You’re welcome. Happy birthday! 🎁🎉🎂
1,@MattyIce4412 @thanr @JamesWorldSpace Yeah; that’s what I’m talking about in that tweet — double-layer Kevlar pressure pod with Teflon coating. Other approach is a long inflatable air sock. Both worth trying.
1,@williamwinters @austinhopperrrr @maysacha @thanr @JamesWorldSpace Exactly. You can put socks on your feet the same way. There would be no relative motion between the tube &amp; rock wall.
1,@jeremysliew It’s open so that others who are closer to the problem can consider this as one possible solution
1,@siwgrindaker @erikveen Should be possible to increase the air inflow rate above the leak rate; unless there is a very big hole. If oxygen % is dropping; suggests that leak holes are not large.
1,@erikveen I would def recommend this
1,@thanr @JamesWorldSpace Building double-layer Kevlar pressure pods with Teflon coating to slip by rocks &amp; front/rear rope tow hitch &amp; lead pockets for neutral buoyancy. ~60 cm oval. Testing this aft in a pool with a subject who has never done SCUBA. Do the divers think something like this might work?
1,@bonnienorman @TeslaBull @trippedover Interesting
1,@thanr @JamesWorldSpace Great; thanks
1,@JamesWorldSpace Inflatable tubes &amp; pods being made out of Kevlar for better abrasion resistance. A SpaceX engineer happens to be in Thailand &amp; is headed there now. Could one of the divers DM me? Need approx contour of most difficult sections for tube fab.
1,@ladykayaker @JamesWorldSpace So long as air pressure in tube higher than water pressure; air will blow out &amp; water won’t come in
1,@thanr @JamesWorldSpace Does you know output voltage &amp; amperage of those generator trucks? 3 phase? What frequency? Will need high voltage transformer to carry power over distance or very thick cable. Beyond that; only batteries will work. Will prep Powerwalls in case needed.
1,@JamesWorldSpace SpaceX &amp; Boring Co engineers headed to Thailand tomorrow to see if we can be helpful to govt. There are probably many complexities that are hard to appreciate without being there in person.
1,@JamesWorldSpace Looks like 1st bit of water is close enough to entrance to be pumped out. 2nd &amp; 3rd would need battery packs; air pumps &amp; tubes. If depth of 2nd is accurate; would need ~0.5 bar tube pressure. Prob need to enter tube; zip up &amp; then transit.
1,@chiefpad @JamesWorldSpace Have a small velcro slit entrance &amp; exit in circumferential direction (half stress of longitudinal direction)
1,@ladykayaker @JamesWorldSpace Walking speed is around 5km/h; but if you’re in an air tube; time doesn’t matter much. If tube diameter was 1.5m; a fast walk of 5km would take 40 mins or so. Just need to duck for the narrow sections.
1,@JamesWorldSpace Maybe worth trying: insert a 1m diameter nylon tube (or shorter set of tubes for most difficult sections) through cave network &amp; inflate with air like a bouncy castle. Should create an air tunnel underwater against cave roof &amp; auto-conform to odd shapes like the 70cm hole.
1,@MelissaLeeCNBC @thesheetztweetz @CNBC @Lebeaucarnews I know you &amp; believe you; but it means Lopez misled readers in her article; because that is exactly what she said

1,@lopezlinette They were sent to me by multiple people on the Internet. I don’t use Facebook.
1,@thesheetztweetz @CNBC @Lebeaucarnews Lopez wrote that Melissa Lee of CNBC was “dancing her face off” with Chanos in Vegas. Is this true? https://t.co/jy7sQkZ4R5
1,@S_Padival @lopezlinette Why did @lopezlinette publish a love letter puff piece about Chanos’s cuff links? Who took the pic? Obv not objective https://t.co/eaLVIgwm7k
1,@S_Padival @lopezlinette .@Lopezlinette posted on social media that she was partying in Vegas with Chanos &amp; Tepper with caption “Love both these dudes”. Doesn’t sound very objective https://t.co/oy1Tz6Cg68
1,@Rayhawn @Tesla Norwegians are right to be upset with Tesla. We are having trouble expanding our service facilities in Oslo especially. Can solve quickly with Tesla mobile service vans; but awaiting govt permission to do so.
1,@ajs @nichcarlson @businessinsider @lopezlinette Are you 100% certain that @businessinsider stands by @lopezlinette &amp; supports everything she’s done? Why won’t Lopez go on record saying that she never offered Tripp anything for inside info or asked him to break his confidentiality agreement by taking detailed video of Tesla IP?
1,@tombrechet @vassilyk @FlatJannrickles @vincent13031925 @TeslaBull @scottwww @stetopinini @S_Padival @lopezlinette @Tesla Sounds fishy. How did that go down?
1,@vincent13031925 @TeslaBull @scottwww @stetopinini @S_Padival @lopezlinette So @lopezlinette publicly stated she stans for Chanos; Tesla’s most prominent short-seller. In her words; he is “one of the greatest.” Her articles print Chanos’s view verbatim. This is not journalism.
1,@scottwww @stetopinini @S_Padival @lopezlinette .@lopezlinette You stated publicly that you “see eye to eye” with Chanos; the most prominent short-seller of Tesla. Have you ever provided him with material non-public information about Tesla?
1,@TeslaBull What a coincidence …
1,@thesheetztweetz @CNBC @Lebeaucarnews Am not attacking all media or even all of @CNBC. Just asked if you inform public about an analyst’s prediction track record about a subject when putting them on your show.
1,@stetopinini @S_Padival @lopezlinette Indeed; very simple question. To be specific: @lopezlinette; did you compensate or promise to compensate Martin Tripp for inside information about Tesla? Did he; under that inducement; provide you with exaggerated negative info; which you printed; but turned out to be untrue?
1,@benjaminpollock @CNBC Exactly. @cnbc; I just asked a simple question. Please answer.
1,@ICannot_Enough @SimRiyat @gawwy @aperezposada @Reuters @sal19 Strange. @cnbc; is it true that you are putting on analysts with such low ratings &amp; extremely bad prediction records? Are your viewers informed about an analyst’s track record before hearing their opinion.
1,Note; no one is in the car or controlling remotely. Car is driving entirely by itself. https://t.co/xSG2Mmy756
1,@S_Padival @lopezlinette Sounds very sketchy if true. @lopezlinette; is it possible you’re  serving as an inside trading source for one of Tesla’s biggest short-sellers? An ex-Tesla employee just went on record formally claiming you bribed him &amp; he sent you valuable Tesla IP in exchange. Is this true?
1,@gawwy @aperezposada @Reuters @sal19 Wow; so @sal19 of @Reuters wrote article that misled public about Model 3 production &amp; followed that up with mean tweet to me on my bday. Nice work @sal19 &amp; @Reuters.
1,@aperezposada @Reuters .@Reuters; why did you mislead the people public about this number?
1,@aperezposada @Reuters .@Reuters is relentlessly negative about Tesla. They just wrote a bogus article saying S production last week was low by 800 cars. S/X annual prod is set at ~100k; ie 1;900/week. Tesla built 1;913 S/X cars at our standard ~50/50 split last week; which is right on target.

1,@rajmathai @Tesla @Teslarati No standard automotive solution could be built in time; so we created a new solution. It is working &amp; has slightly higher quality than the more traditional general assembly line. Perhaps most surprising is that the total cost of production in the Sprung tent is lower.
1,@pulletsforever All Tesla vehicles come with cabin overheat protection https://t.co/q9fjKckewO
1,@clprenz @JoeyOstrander I hate whole idea of brands and branding. So much bs. I hope it messes with our brand. Brands suck.
1,@TheSeanBooker Sir; this will not be some a dainty little buttercup of a truck! Driver’s seat will be big enough to fit André the giant (love that guy).
1,@JoeyOstrander 400 to 500 mile option definitely. Higher; maybe.
1,@ZacksJerryRig For sure
1,@MattPTurner Should be easy to add as a feature like calendar
1,You’re welcome! https://t.co/NcsGhhB1Ja
1,@TheHoff525 Yes. Highly recommend doing so btw.
1,@clintdebusk That will be standard

1,@Penenberg For sure! When doing US govt crash safety testing; the Model S roof was so strong; it broke their testing machine. https://t.co/m9Ae9mhRIC
1,@MuellerJeffrey Wow; great idea! Since it will already have a Tesla pneumatics system; it totally makes sense to add a utility port.
1,Pickup truck will have power outlets allowing use of heavy duty 240V; high power tools in field all day. No generator needed.
1,The Tesla Truck will have dual motor all-wheel drive w crazy torque &amp; a suspension that dynamically adjusts for load. Those will be standard.
1,@aMidLifeCrisis It will parallel park automatically &amp; have 360 degree cameras &amp; sonar
1,What would you love to see in a Tesla pickup truck? I have a few things in mind; but what do you think are small; but important nuances &amp; what would be seriously next level?
1,@EV20018 @justwidle2 @Tesla “Virtue signaling” is super annoying &amp; there are lots of phoneys who are actually huge jerks; but jump on every social cause du jour. But I’m really proud of the fact that # of changes Tesla had to make to achieve 100/100 (before even knowing about the LGBTQ index) was zero.
1,@justwidle2 @Tesla Don’t buy our car if that’s a problem. People should be free to live their lives where their heart takes them ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🖤💖🌈

1,@PPathole @RehearsalLot @guiscaesar @surfersnout @aedmondsauthor @barbiesway @TwitterMoments @RepMaxineWaters @PolitiFact Important to read the Wash Post article. The “unable to account for” number does not refer to actual lost children. It refers to calls not answered or returned in a 30 day period.
1,@coremwm Hopefully in V9.0 release in a few months
1,@JohnnaSabri @RehearsalLot @guiscaesar @surfersnout @aedmondsauthor @barbiesway @TwitterMoments @RepMaxineWaters @PolitiFact True
1,@RehearsalLot @guiscaesar @surfersnout @aedmondsauthor @barbiesway @TwitterMoments @RepMaxineWaters @PolitiFact We should always be concerned about the welfare of children &amp; those who cannot protect themselves; wherever they may be; but it seems much of the reporting on this issue has been partisan &amp; often inaccurate
1,@RehearsalLot @guiscaesar @surfersnout @aedmondsauthor @barbiesway @TwitterMoments @RepMaxineWaters @PolitiFact “… of the 7;635 children; 6;075 remained where they were placed; 52 had moved; 28 had run away and five were deported. That left 1;475 migrant children. Just because their parents or guardians did not return HHS’s phone calls after 30 days does not mean the children are missing”
1,@RehearsalLot @guiscaesar @surfersnout @aedmondsauthor @barbiesway @TwitterMoments @RepMaxineWaters @PolitiFact “All 7;635 children were resettled by HHS. After 30 days; the department called the parents or guardians to check up on things. But these calls were not required by law; and in 1;475 cases; the parents or guardians did not respond”

1,@GetMyGist As individuals; we will all die in blink of an eye on a galactic timescale. What can live on for long time is civilization. Those who first go to other planets will face far more risk of death &amp; hardship than those who stay. Over time; space travel will be safe &amp; open to all.
1,@xkcdComic This doesn’t take into account shifting trillions of tons of carbon from subsurface to atmosphere; which could accelerate overheating time by a factor of a million (or so). This is why Tesla.
1,@lazarusrang Humanity is not perfect; but it’s all we’ve got
1,@xkcdComic Could be very close call. Earth is ~4.5B years old &amp; sun will expand to heat Earth beyond livable temp in ~0.5B years; so if advent of civilization took 10% longer; it wouldn’t have happened at all.

1,@thescalex Yes; we are essentially a steward of life &amp; duty-bound imo to ensure its continuance

1,@disapr_ @cybik It’s called Top Secret
1,@CateLuvsLondon @vicentes @S_Padival @bourgeoisalien @jacobinmag When I was a kid; I built model airplanes; trainsets; rockets (mixed my own powder); explosives (kinda surprised I still have all fingers); a radio; lots of software. Built a primitive MRI machine in college.
1,@vicentes @S_Padival @bourgeoisalien @jacobinmag Yeah; but I’m not sure what the big deal is. I like building things. If that ends up being useful work too; even better.
1,@ddkilzer @wk057 @Tesla We will add a config to lower the alert

1,@erikbryn @vplikeTRUMP @jorendewachter @xJawz @joerogan @MazzucatoM Today. It’s kinda there in US with welfare but rules are messed up and amount is too low.
1,@vplikeTRUMP @jorendewachter @xJawz @joerogan @MazzucatoM Also think there should be a universal basic income that doesn’t change even if you get a job. Productivity should be rewarded.
1,@adultswim Because honey is a vegetable
1,@Santiago7K @xJawz @joerogan Considerably less so than our competitors (longer discussion)
1,@vplikeTRUMP @jorendewachter @xJawz @joerogan @MazzucatoM Yes; consumption tax is way better. Also; higher estate tax better than income/cap gains tax. Probability of progeny being equally excellent at capital allocation is not high.
1,@PeacefulChaos7 @DanAloni @xJawz @joerogan Exactly
1,@jorendewachter @xJawz @joerogan @MazzucatoM He’s obv wrong. Forcing function for any 100% mkt share monopolist to improve is weak &amp; a national govt is that by fiat. One may find lowish correlation for negativity; but that does not mean low causation.
1,@EvilCorpGame Great name. A little on the nose.
1,@DanAloni @xJawz @joerogan That’s really decision about how good you think govt is at allocating capital. Buffett; for example; is vastly better than any govt at allocating capital. Consumption vs capital allocation extremely misunderstood. Biggest missing piece in public understanding of what “money” is.
1,@xJawz @joerogan Yeah; all-inclusive tax rate of 40% seems about right. Below 30% is unrealistic for critical govt functions unless national defense is de facto outsourced &amp; above 50% too negatively affects economic output.

1,@PPathole @dawg_fan_93 @maysacha @JayPrisefighter @cfarivar It’s actually way better than the factory building. More comfortable &amp; a great view of the mountains.
1,@maysacha @JayPrisefighter @cfarivar Not sure we actually need a building. This tent is pretty sweet. Tesla Grohmann line is in place at Giga &amp; spooling up now. They super kicked ass too. Heiliger Strohsack!
1,@JayPrisefighter @cfarivar They also poured the concrete &amp; built the whole assembly line using scrap we had in warehouses. And it’s way better than the other GA line that cost hundreds of millions!
1,@cfarivar Needed another general assembly line to reach 5k/week Model 3 production. A new building was impossible; so we built a giant tent in 2 weeks. Tesla team kfa!! Gah; love them so much ♥️🚘💫

1,@goombar3 We’ve always provided healthcare; hourly wages above union &amp; Tesla stock. Also; free drinks &amp; snacks. Try to make it fun too. Top ten hourly workers cumulatively received Tesla stock now worth $1M to $2M. Nobody wants UAW; so UAW keeps trashing Tesla &amp; me via 3rd parties.
1,@taimurstriker Glad you teach physics. That and critical thinking (ie how not to be tricked) are foundational for all kids to learn.
1,@iamJeffTorres @thehartej @yaronbrook @VitalikButerin Yeah; I think we pretty much agree. Btw; great show.
1,@iamJeffTorres @thehartej @yaronbrook @VitalikButerin I think essential services; incl health care; should be taken care of by govt/taxpayers (socialist) &amp; other parts of economy should be served by companies competing to serve the people (capitalist). Aka; the view held by most of America.

1,@TeslaCharts I don’t want to see anyone lose their money. Or I will at least provide fair warning before it happens; as I have done in the past.
1,@slack2thefuture @doctorow You think all companies are bad and all unions good? That’s a very bigoted position.
1,Well said https://t.co/lDPaIPLLzO
1,@TeslaCharts Then you’ll be fine
1,@JohnnaSabri @indiemusicfan9 @dimas_______ @Robotbeat @doctorow Exactly. Our NDA is actually shorter &amp; simpler than most.
1,@indiemusicfan9 @dimas_______ @Robotbeat @doctorow ...which clearly doesn’t work. UAW and Wall Street shorts know every detail of what’s happening at Tesla. Storm clouds are gathering; so they’re getting desperate.
1,@doctorow @dimas_______ @Robotbeat Then look a little closer; doctorow. Read the whole thread.
1,@indiemusicfan9 @dimas_______ @Robotbeat @doctorow More propaganda. The NDA only prevents disclosure of Tesla proprietary IP or material non-public information (insider trading).
1,@TeslaCharts How big is your short position? Just curious.
1,@doctorow I endorse freedom to form a union too; as well as freedom not to do so if they feel Tesla is a good company. UAW has major conflicts of interest &amp; failed our car plant already when they abandoned us in 2010. Tesla can only hire 5% of applicants; so must be doing something right.
1,@dimas_______ @Robotbeat @doctorow UAW doesn’t have 30% of signatures (about 6000 people) needed for a vote. They can’t even muster enough people for a free bbq. Instead; they’re getting paid trolls &amp; far left shills to trash Tesla &amp; me in press &amp; social media. Such creeps.
1,@TheSithSeth @doctorow I’m not against all unions; but UAW has a track record of destroying productivity so a company can’t compete on world market. Our current factory went bankrupt under UAW before we took it over. Don’t want Tesla to die too.
1,@Robotbeat @doctorow I am too; of sorts. Govt (ie other taxpayers) should take care of critical needs of people; incl defense; judiciary; health care; etc. Rest should be companies competing to provide best product or service to the people.
1,@AntVenom @Shaynooooo @kausthav_ray @SpaceX Was originally called Puff the Magic Dragon; as people said I was high if though it could work; so I named it after their insult.
1,@doctorow Iain certainly wasn’t pro-union in the Culture books. At all. And wouldn’t be in the case of Tesla. Banks was about freedom through &amp; through. Maybe for a single buyer (monopsony) vs single seller (monopoly); I would be too; but that’s a special case.

1,@kikkerin @soniasimone Very appealing if you’re a sophomore in college. It’s a counterpoint to communism and useful as such; but should be tempered with kindness.
1,@Gubisoul @monongahelaEX @AntVenom That is why it is critical to support competition. Excess profits draw in competitors who then drive down prices.
1,@monongahelaEX @AntVenom Read Das Kapital when I was 14; incl cross-checking English translation of original German. Adam Smith FTW obv. Ironically; future automation will naturally lead to greater equality of consumption. Monopolies are true enemy of people. Competing to serve is good.

1,@Erdayastronaut @Lord_Lima_Bean @UHDDreamer @LanceUlanoff Trade is just that Roadster becomes a 2 seater instead of a 2+2. COPV in place of the kid seats; which is prob wise for many reasons
1,@Lord_Lima_Bean @UHDDreamer @LanceUlanoff Exactly. Total energy stored even in ultra compressed air is low vs battery; but power output is insane. The composite overwrapped pressure vessel (COPV) is most advanced ever made. It’s what SpaceX is qualifying for NASA crewed missions. Extremely robust — literally bulletproof.

1,@raptorweb Sigh. This is crux of matter: can’t make system too annoying or people won’t use it; negatively affecting safety; but also can’t allow people to get too complacent or safety again suffers. Latest update should have a positive effect on latter issue especially.
1,@Off_thewalls @MKBHD @joerogan A lot of people whose judgment I respect have suggested this. Sounds like a good idea. Will do so after Model 3 production reaches 5k/week steady.
1,@VHollywood21 Yes. Hopefully; I’m not tempting fate too much with that date. It was meant as a joke; but is about the right actual timing.
1,@MKBHD Will do
1,@bartjehoel @djenkins6 Correct; pure electric. Wish orbital rockets could be so too; but there’s no escaping Newton’s Third Law. SpaceX is already developing high efficiency CO2 capture with H2O to form liquid CH4 (methane) &amp; O2. Critical for propellant production at Mars Base Alpha.
1,@MKBHD You have my word; Marques. Next gen Roadster will be absolutely out of this world. For those who love to drive; there is no finer car in history and we don’t think there will be another.
1,@LanceUlanoff Note; gas contained would be ultra high pressure air in a SpaceX rocket COPV bottle. The air exiting the thrusters would immediately be replenished whenever vehicle pack power draw allowed operation of the air pump; which is most of the time.
1,@LanceUlanoff Intent of new Tesla Roadster is to beat gas sports cars on every performance metric by far; no exceptions; thus transferring the “halo crown” effect gas cars have as the top speed leaders over to pure electric.
1,@anandrajk @lexiheft @Tesla That issue is better in latest Autopilot software rolling out now &amp; fully fixed in August update as part of our long-awaited Tesla Version 9. To date; Autopilot resources have rightly focused entirely on safety. With V9; we will begin to enable full self-driving features.
1,This is why I’m not impressed when reporters who were literally in junior high while I was in newsrooms all round the world say that if I only knew how newsrooms really worked; then I’d know everything’s fine &amp; no need for a media credibility rating system like Pravduh 🤔
1,Zip2 also built a newspaper publishing platform that brought hundreds of regional &amp; city papers online for the first time; and made major functionality advancements to the NY Times; Boston Globe &amp; Knight-Ridder websites. NYT; KR &amp; Hearst were all major investors in Zip2.
1,@trace_remick @FredericLambert 20 years of intense programming on extremely weak CPUs with nothing for memory &amp; a straw for bandwidth tends to burn itself onto your 🧠 like a branding iron. Can still remember trying to squeeze fractions of a millisecond out of the /?€}%$&amp; fetch_joystick_state function.
1,@FredericLambert In early 90s; I wrote a multitasker for PCs that spoofed the CPU &amp; CD-ROM to act in parallel; so could read video continuously while player sprite moved smoothly. Required C++; assembly &amp; direct flipping of CPU registers. That company’s name was Rocket Science. Fate loves irony.
1,@FredericLambert That’s quite a blast from the past! After my Zip2 experience w patents; I felt that patents (particularly software) inhibited innovation; instead of fostering it. I aspired to file zero patents after that. In 2014; we open-sourced all Tesla patents https://t.co/HPK5R5UMS6
1,At Zip2; I wrote entire V1 of software for drawing vector maps &amp; calculating point to point directions anywhere in US (first ever company to do so); as well as white pages &amp; business listings w reviews (an early Yelp). Also wrote V1 of classifieds; autotrading &amp; real estate apps.
1,More background: I arrived in North America at 17 w $2000; a backpack &amp; a suitcase full of books. Paid my own way thru college. Dropped out of Stanford Eng/Phys grad school w $110k in college debt. Created Internet startup w bro &amp; Greg Khouri (love bro &amp; loved Greg; may he RIP)
1,@FrankIppolito @boringcompany We don’t think our product will be the cause of any wildfires; but The Boring Company is donating $10k.
1,@djenkins6 Using the config you describe; plus an electric pump to replenish air in COPV; when car power draw drops below max pack power output; makes sense. But we are going to go a lot further.
1,19 years ago; when my 1st company got bought; I had to decide between buying a house in Palo Alto or a McLaren F1 (best car ever imo). Was no contest. I bought F1 &amp; a small condo that was much cheaper than the car. New Tesla Roadster will exceed all gas sports cars in every way…
1,SpaceX option package for new Tesla Roadster will include ~10 small rocket thrusters arranged seamlessly around car. These rocket engines dramatically improve acceleration; top speed; braking &amp; cornering. Maybe they will even allow a Tesla to fly …
1,Terms &amp; conditions for “Not-a-Flamethrower”  Please use as directed to avoid unintentionally burning things down. For simple &amp; concise instructions; we drew upon wisdom in great Dr Seuss book “Green Eggs and Ham”.   #ThrowFlamesResponsibly https://t.co/kgj8W8EOLJ
1,Almost forgot! Due to recent regulatory/customs rules enacted to inhibit transport of anything called a Flamethrower; we have renamed our product: “Not a Flamethrower”.
1,@SPPhotonic Each flamethrower comes with a state-of-the-art The Boring Company brand fire extinguisher.   Will offer a TBC ice blaster before the dry season starts in winter.
1,Flamethrower obv best way to light your fireplace/BBQ. No more need to use a dainty “match” to ignite! If no wood; just drop your flamethrower in fire place! It will generate way more warmth than a quaint pile of logs.
1,@teslamarcus1 Coming soon
1,@mikesidneyphoto I think so :)

1,@teslaology @DMC_Ryan @Tesla We’re building out Tesla body repair in all major metro areas to ensure super fast &amp; excellent outcome
1,@DMC_Ryan Talked with Tesla team. Looks like we can do the aluminum Model 3 pedal covers (slightly different from S). Turning on production for Model 3 Performance version.
1,@pmnordkvist Gigafactory should be on 100% renewable energy (primarily solar with some wind) by next year. Rollout of solar already begun.
1,@Nate_072 @SpaceX Yeah; actually closer to Skylab; but with 50% larger inner diameter
1,And we’re definitely going to have a pod bay door override button. Lesson learned.
1,@MKBHD Definitely. Will also have Augmented Mode that will massively enhance human driving ability. Like a flying metal suit; but in car form …
1,Running track in @SpaceX BF Spaceship will look something like this https://t.co/563upTfV58
1,@DMC_Ryan No plans for aluminum pedals. Adds too much production complexity. Model 3 will def have summon; which will get way more advanced for S &amp; X w HW2 Autopilot &amp; all Model 3 cars.
1,@jovanik21 @Tesla Working on improving
1,@ElliottGotkine No way 6 mins is enough for abs. I mean; come on; 7 mins is obv right.

1,@cassianelwes Appreciated on behalf of Tesla team
1,@Jamie_Sullivan4 @Model3Owners You should get an invite to configure in next few days
1,@MacTechGenius @Model3Owners Definitely
1,@Heretic_Soul @Model3Owners Leasing negatively effects Tesla cash flow; so we prob won’t offer Model 3 leases for 6 to 9 months. Loan financing is a better deal anyway; as bank conservatism for new car models is v conservative about residual value; but Teslas have always had strong residual value.
1,@Model3Owners Model 3 Performance order page progressively rolling out to reservation holders over the next week or so. It’s a really great car. Not saying that lightly. Test drive is a mindwarp. Aiming to have these as our first test drive Model 3 cars in stores within 4 to 6 week’s.

1,@SpiritosoV @KumJm @STcom Exactly!
1,@tycoonmindset05 I was an alien 🛸👽♥️💫
1,@NathanWickland @STcom Actually true!
1,@KumJm @STcom Singapore has enough land area to generate most of its electricity from the sun. Solar energy is more than most people realize. 250MW per sq km at current commercial efficiency solar panels. No more need to import fossil fuels for electricity; which is a strategic vulnerability.
1,@STcom But don’t worry; cars have been tested for emissions levels &amp; everything’s just fine https://t.co/cg4ooQSrX3
1,@STcom Why have policies that promote a combustion vehicle fleet in a dense city environment? In bumper to bumper traffic; each car’s exhaust pipes releases poison gases right into the air intake of car behind. This is not healthy.
1,@STcom The results speak for themselves. Singapore is a very prosperous city and yet has very few electric cars.

1,@nickg_uk Mid 2019 for RHD
1,@nashlib That sounds like a fun adventure!
1,@nickg_uk You can just take the aero inserts out of the standard wheel &amp; it looks pretty cool. We could offer that as an option at purchase.
1,@Arkved78 Model 3 should be second best in world after Model S/X. Still super good; but we went a little 🥜 on S/X.
1,Filters bacteria; viruses; spores; pollen &amp; particulate of almost any kind https://t.co/dlQHJfKdpU
1,@Seanmmvi @OlofTenghoff @Tesla Model S &amp; X also have an acid gas filter; an alkaline gas filter &amp; a carbon monoxide detector that autoswitches car to recirc mode. We should prob tell people about this more. Filters are giant; so too big to fit in Model 3.
1,Cool; Tesla S/X have hospital operating room air quality when BWD mode is activated; so shd protect against even a weaponized virus https://t.co/gIELCeXN1C

1,@johnny0129 @jeffnesbit @Tesla True; no one is perfect
1,@JeffreyWolder @jeffnesbit @Tesla You’re most welcome. More to come in this regard.
1,@jeffnesbit @Tesla Tesla will always refute articles that are misleading &amp; point out if there is someone with a pattern of doing so. Many fit this description; but Consumer Reports is always fair &amp; accurate in their criticism.
1,@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Ride comfort &amp; aero/road noise already better than CR car; which was early production. Wish we could make the car perfect from day 1; but there’s always room for improvement. Highly recommend dropping tire pressure 10% below max to ~39 psi for comfort. Only affects range by ~2%.
1,@annerajb @Henry_Pivac Prob 8.3
1,All items below will go to all Model 3s within next few months with V8.2 software. To report a bug or ask for a feature; press voice button; say “bug report” followed by issue description. https://t.co/ea7FTOn2cE
1,@prakash_d @grillick @IndianInterest “Pneumatic” means propelled by air. Opposite of Hyperloop.
1,@v_g_fischer @ConsumerReports Yeah; absolutely
1,Really appreciate the high quality critical feedback from @ConsumerReports. Road noise &amp; ride comfort already addressed too. UI improvements coming via remote software update later this month. https://t.co/ZMLPJxmPlM
1,Like you guys too 🚘 🖤 https://t.co/PVQVyR1nXY
1,@IndianInterest Actually; Hyperloop draws a near vacuum in tube &amp; each pod is powered w electric motors. It is opposite of pneumatically powered.
1,@yoyovinzi Would love to be in India. Some challenging government regulations; unfortunately. Deepak Ahuja; our CFO; is from India. Tesla will be there as soon as he believes we should.
1,@annerajb @eli_schiff Good progress. Really proud of this design &amp; SpaceX propulsion team. This engine is something special.
1,@eli_schiff Peace ✌️

1,At risk of stating the extremely obvious; I am against threats of violence &amp; abusive epithets in any forum. Please do not use them in my name or at all.
1,@kevinmgill You’re saying a BBC reporter who attacked me for months w unprofessional language &amp; ad hominem attacks; then deleted those tweets to hide them; is a “good person”?
1,@NoahShachtman @thedailybeast @erinbiba This journalist has been attacking me for months incl using genitalia language that she now says is sexist. What a hypocrite! https://t.co/aXPsmLnh48
1,@HahTse @neilhimself @AnozieUdemezue @upulie @davidkfried “Nano” is a unit of measure; not a field imo. Would’ve been sexist *not* to express an opinion simply because someone is a woman.
1,@NoahShachtman @thedailybeast @erinbiba Hello; have you met the Internet? Everyone gets harassed regardless of gender; especially if they say false things. Saying I’m against science is like saying Beyoncé doesn’t know beats. Blowback from latter (all genders) would make my comment stream seem like Socratic dialogue.
1,@neilhimself @AnozieUdemezue @upulie @davidkfried Gaiman; did you actually read my tweets? I didn’t set anyone on anyone. A BBC science reporter tweeted that I was anti-science &amp; I said that was false. Are you saying I don’t have the right to deny false accusations? That’s messed up.
1,@NoahShachtman @thedailybeast @erinbiba You’ve done something incredibly dishonest by supporting a journo who falsely stated that I’m against science; then cherrypicked tweets that don’t represent the vast majority of my followers to make false claims against them too
1,@amasad @its_a_massacre @fung9815 @israrayyaz @Sra_Mister @waitbutwhy Great book. Read it when it came out.
1,@amasad @its_a_massacre @fung9815 @israrayyaz @Sra_Mister @waitbutwhy Exactly

1,@WorldAndScience You have so many great pics &amp; factoids!
1,@G_Whitehead5 @DMC_Ryan @Model3Owners @Tesla Yes; AWD P first and then AWD. Production costs are always high when line first gets going; so we have to sell higher price versions first or each car will have very negative margins. As production efficiency rises; we can make lower cost versions &amp; not lose money.
1,@davidtayar5 @annerajb @LikeTeslaKim I really want to make this cupholder

1,@joshuatopolsky @oneunderscore__ @ParkerMolloy @2sunsky @ashleyfeinberg Seems to be glitch where tweet to which I replied isn’t showing up; removing context. A journo said polls are meaningless because controlled by “powerful people” &amp; my response was that powerful people also own media. Thus; if you discount polls; you should also discount media. https://t.co/c01JolZENY
1,@TeslaTurk Thanks 😀
1,@utkuspace Superchargers will ultimately cover the entire region
1,@oneunderscore__ @joshuatopolsky @ParkerMolloy @2sunsky @ashleyfeinberg Pointing out to aspiring journo &amp; Rodin spokesmodel; Josh Top; who thinks public polls are controlled by “powerful people” that the media is *owned* by same. Anyone who thought this was anti-Semitic is just revealing their inner bigot. The context is very clear.
1,@minliangtan @taglia Thanks for offering to help. I will check with my team.

1,@oneunderscore__ @ParkerMolloy @2sunsky @ashleyfeinberg You’re missing the point &amp; living in a bubble of self-righteous sanctimony. The public doesn’t trust you. This was true *before* the last election &amp; only got worse. Don’t believe me? Run your own poll …
1,@oneunderscore__ @ParkerMolloy @2sunsky @ashleyfeinberg You’re welcome to come by SpaceX; but please stop assuming I’m against all journalists. This is not true. Something needs to be done to improve public trust in media.

1,@DavisTravis9830 @amywestervelt @Billsocalif @RMac18 @weinbergersa Definitely did not. I’ve been through many press cycles &amp; know full well same person praising me today will trash me tomorrow. Journos hound me constantly for interviews; but I do almost none these days. ♥️ Twitter as it allows me to bypass journo bs.
1,@amywestervelt @Billsocalif @RMac18 @weinbergersa I’ve just had it with sanctimonious journalists who appoint themselves protectors of the public interest &amp; yet believe that same public is too stupid &amp; immoral to assess their credibility. It’s amazing that you don’t understand how insufferably hypocritical that is. Wow.
1,@spacecom @amywestervelt @weinbergersa The Tesla facility is open plan &amp; we’re not going to erect walls everywhere for a journo tour. I know journalists too well &amp; they are some of the worst &amp; best human beings I’ve ever met. You’re the former.
1,@medickinson @thephysicsgirl Nano applies to everything &amp; therefore means nothing. Definitely indicates bs. Sorry. https://t.co/WQp8j9YkeJ
1,@amywestervelt @weinbergersa Yes; because Tesla has the most advanced battery manufacturing technology in the world &amp; products that haven’t been unveiled yet. You don’t have a right to show that to our competitors or spoil future product launches.
1,@weinbergersa Wow; you’re ignorant. Don’t remember you; but disclosing classified US missile technology to hostile nations would violate ITAR law &amp; land you in jail. I didn’t review it; but my team did. Obviously nobody cared about what your article said. Please.

1,@PassionPlanet1 @supernovaslight @lexiheft @dancow @tedhu @chadgowens @scottwww @JessicaHuseman Exactly. The point of such a site would be to help restore the credibility of the media. They don’t realize how little credibility they actually have with the public.
1,@lexiheft @dancow @tedhu @chadgowens @scottwww @JessicaHuseman Why are certain journalists (editors especially) so concerned about the public rating their credibility? All they do all day is rate others; ostensibly on behalf of the same public for which they have contempt.
1,@dancow @tedhu @chadgowens @scottwww @JessicaHuseman I did to any who asked

1,@ParkerMolloy I’ve never stopped a union vote nor removed a union. UAW abandoned this factory. Tesla arrived &amp; gave people back their jobs. They haven’t forgotten UAW betrayed them. That’s why UAW can’t even get people to attend a free BBQ; let alone enough sigs for a vote.
1,@meharris Of course
1,@scottwww @JessicaHuseman It is strange that big auto companies literally have thousands more factory injuries than Tesla &amp; millions more auto deaths; but somehow get less coverage. We are not perfect; but we’re doing our best to make clean energy real &amp; be a good company.
1,@JessicaHuseman @reveal No; they’re just some rich kids in Berkeley who took their political science prof too seriously
1,@iShashankBhatia Will do
1,Create a media credibility rating site (that also flags propaganda botnets)
1,@scotch_io That’s why editors are included too
1,@SophieWarnes We don’t. The media is reporting someone else saying that Tesla advertised. It is untrue.
1,Even if some of the public doesn’t care about the credibility score; the journalists; editors &amp; publications will. It is how they define themselves.
1,@DetroitVictoria Enough of the public does care about the truth. I have faith in the people.
1,@AntVenom Maybe some good people from those orgs who would join
1,@Virtualanom Not only needs to be botproof; but seek &amp; unmask anyone operating a disinformation bot army
1,@sakiwebo Exactly
1,Going to create a site where the public can rate the core truth of any article &amp; track the credibility score over time of each journalist; editor &amp; publication. Thinking of calling it Pravda …
1,@dancow @WSJ An exception that proves the rule
1,@CodyBrown Uh; this is Twitter. How many characters do you want?
1,Problem is journos are under constant pressure to get max clicks &amp; earn advertising dollars or get fired. Tricky situation; as Tesla doesn’t advertise; but fossil fuel companies &amp; gas/diesel car companies are among world’s biggest advertisers.
1,@teddymonacelli The media has earned this mistrust. But maybe there is a solution.
1,@jaspar Oh hey another sanctimonious media person who thinks he’s above criticism. Try being truthful &amp; the public will believe you again.
1,@andyjayhawk Thought you’d say that. Anytime anyone criticizes the media; the media shrieks “You’re just like Trump!” Why do you think he got elected in the first place? Because no ones believes you any more. You lost your credibility a long time ago.
1,The holier-than-thou hypocrisy of big media companies who lay claim to the truth; but publish only enough to sugarcoat the lie; is why the public no longer respects them https://t.co/Ay2DwCOMkr

1,@kulpability @DeusEx Busted 👻
1,@CateLuvsLondon @Aceinmysleeve1 @ericbrownzzz @dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA None of those criteria are certain by themselves; but when taken together &amp; messages have an obv agenda; it almost always indicates use of a network of self-validating troll accounts
1,@Aceinmysleeve1 @ericbrownzzz @dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA Troll dead giveaways: not using real names; obv fake pics &amp; backgrounds; low follower/follow ratio; account recently created; repeating same phrases; etc (sigh)
1,@AustinOnSocial Great idea!
1,@annerajb @ericbrownzzz @dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA Will do it later this year. Too much on plate right now. Will be available as an upgrade from service.
1,@DeusEx Love original Deus Ex! That would be awesome.
1,@matthunter Just order your car with the James Bond option package. It’s an off-menu item for those in the know 😉
1,@ericbrownzzz @dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA But ya know what; let’s test that theory. Maybe we do want UAW back; even tho UAW betrayed us 8 years ago &amp; left us here to rot. Maybe we want UAW back even tho injury rate today is 1/2 what it was with them &amp; wages were lower. Maybe. Let’s hold a vote &amp; find out.
1,@speea @AlterViggo @juliacarriew In theory true; but not how UAW behaved. They drove GM &amp; Chrysler to bankruptcy &amp; lost 200;000+ jobs for people they were supposed to protect; incl abandoning NUMMI plant workers.Tesla took over &amp; now it has 10k+ jobs.UAW destroyed once great US auto industry &amp; everyone knows it.
1,We’re going to include some fun games as hidden Easter eggs in Tesla S; X &amp; 3. What do you think would be most fun in a car using the center touch screen?
1,@OldManLink Good point
1,@ericbrownzzz @dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA No; UAW does that. They want divisiveness &amp; enforcement of 2 class “lords &amp; commoners” system. That sucks. US fought War of Independence to get *rid* of a 2 class system! Managers &amp; workers shd be equal w easy movement either way. Managing sucks btw. Hate doing it so much.
1,@mikeyfranklin @dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA More “Reveal” bs. Tesla is overseen by Cal/OSHA; most stringent labor safety org in US; &amp; they’ve never found us to misrepresent. On other hand; Ford; Chrysler &amp; GM (UAW) have repeatedly been found to fake safety numbers. Strangely; that info is missing from Reveal article …
1,@SarahKnuckey @JeffBezos @Oprah @kobebryant @richardbranson @shanesmith30 No problem
1,@SarahKnuckey @JeffBezos @Oprah @kobebryant @richardbranson @shanesmith30 They are incorrect. We never met; nor have we ever been scheduled to meet.
1,@DMC_Ryan @loganthefirst Thanks again; have conveyed your words to the Tesla team; who have been working crazy hard. Really energizing!
1,@SarahKnuckey @JeffBezos @Oprah @kobebryant @richardbranson @shanesmith30 I didn’t meet with him
1,@dinisguarda I definitely don’t do this 5 minute thing. Need to have long uninterrupted times to think. Can’t be creative otherwise.
1,Just wanted to say thanks to all Tesla supporters. I damn well love you.
1,@rrosenbl @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert @Tesla Have been meaning to get around to talking to him. Some of his criticisms are valid; but; on the higher body/chassis weight front; he wasn’t fully appreciating that we were going for much higher crash safety levels than other cars.
1,@DMC_Ryan @loganthefirst Thanks Ryan. Critical feedback after you get the car would be much appreciated; no matter how nuanced.
1,@samuelrogg @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert To be clear; all Model 3 cars; incl early production will have same great braking ability. Nature of any product; however; is that if you care about perfection; you make constant small refinements. Today’s Model S is far more refined than initial production.
1,@rrosenbl @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert ABS calibration algorithm
1,@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Also; Consumer Reports has an early production car. Model 3 now has improved ride comfort; lower wind noise &amp; many other small improvements. Will request that they test current production.
1,@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Looks like this can be fixed with a firmware update. Will be rolling that out in a few days. With further refinement; we can improve braking distance beyond initial specs. Tesla won’t stop until Model 3 has better braking than any remotely comparable car.
1,@camgfrost @DMC_Ryan @loganthefirst Stop; you’re making me blush ☺️
1,@DMC_Ryan @loganthefirst Also; not promising anything; but we *might* be able to increase Model 3 Performance power output a little
1,@DMC_Ryan @loganthefirst Complexity is the devil. Words can’t express how hard we are working on the Model 3 production ramp &amp; trying to get to profitability. But we’ll try.
1,@teslaology @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Good point. Yeah; we will do that for the bigger locations.
1,@LanceUlanoff The CR braking result is inconsistent with other reviewers; but might indicate that some Model 3’s have longer braking distances than others. If so; we will address this at our expense. First time we’ve seen anything like this.
1,@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Even if a physical upgrade is needed to existing fleet; we will make sure all Model 3’s having amazing braking ability at no expense to customers
1,@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Very strange. Model 3 is designed to have super good stopping distance &amp; others reviewers have confirmed this. If there is vehicle variability; we will figure it out &amp; address. May just be a question of firmware tuning; in which case can be solved by an OTA software update.
1,@reveal @dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA @Al_Letson Cool; we can do the interview at Tesla in front of the yellow barriers &amp; beeping forklifts you said didn’t exist. Please send your meeting request to wakassliar@tesla.com.
1,@MrsYomaddy @dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA Gwynne’s awesome. Been SpaceX prez for 10 years. Super love working with her.
1,@dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA Also; UAW did nada for job security in last recession. Dropped Fremont like a hot potato to protect their core base in Detroit. UAW *chose* to exit this plant before Tesla even arrived. We had nothing to do with UAW leaving; but everything to do with why people here have jobs.
1,@dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues &amp; give up stock options for nothing? Our safety record is 2X better than when plant was UAW &amp; everybody already gets healthcare.
1,@dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA Tesla factory literally has miles of painted yellow lines &amp; tape. Report about forklifts not beeping is also bs. These are both demonstrably false; but were reported as “facts” by Reveal.

1,@georgechang @Tesla For sure before snowfall this year
1,@clprenz @ivanovi_ivaylo Exactly! Will probably unveil next gen Supercharger late summer. Major improvements all round.
1,@ivanovi_ivaylo With production; 1st you need achieve target rate &amp; then smooth out flow to achieve target cost. Shipping min cost Model 3 right away wd cause Tesla to lose money &amp; die. Need 3 to 6 months after 5k/wk to ship $35k Tesla &amp; live.
1,@willardslammo @marshall5912 @buckycovington @MacTechGenius That means nothing. Literally your Mom could file for NLRB.
1,@MacTechGenius @marshall5912 @buckycovington Exactly 🚀💫🎉! That will be really fun &amp; shed light on what’s happening. Hoping to start that later this year after we become profitable. Difficult to justify before then.
1,@marshall5912 @buckycovington @MacTechGenius Yeah; “Reveal” was carefully constructed propaganda with a name that wd make Orwell proud. Workplace injury rate of our factory when it was UAW w Toyota/GM was twice as high as today’s non-union.
1,@marshall5912 @buckycovington @MacTechGenius About 2% of Tesla; incl salaried &amp; hourly; union &amp; non-union were let go in annual review. Only known union person fired was a guy who repeatedly threatened non-union supporters verbally &amp; on social media &amp; lied about it.
1,@marshall5912 @buckycovington @MacTechGenius They can form a union whenever they want &amp; there’s nothing I can do to stop them. California is a very pro-union state. They just don’t want to.
1,@paulmacguyscott Upgrade to the latest S. Nothing will give you greater joy. It’s like being able to have dopamine jacked straight into your brain at will.
1,@Josh_Soto They are correct. It’s awesome. Second best driving feel of any car in the world imo; apart from Model S. Traction control precision is super tight.
1,@JimmyRussellExe It does so constantly; but so smoothly that you can’t tell
1,@AntVenom @zacharyj98 Depends on when you placed your initial reservation. We start delivering the dual motor Model 3 in July.
1,@Josh_Soto Three or four months; depending on demand level. We have enough for about 1000/week right now.
1,@zacharyj98 Good idea ...
1,@MacTechGenius That is true. Electric motors are far more reliable than combustion engines. You need an electric motor just to start a gas engine!
1,Tesla dual motor means there is a motor in front &amp; a motor in rear. One is optimized for power &amp; one for range. Car drives fine even if a motor breaks down. Helps ensure you make it to your destination &amp; don’t get stuck on side of road in potentially unsafe conditions.
1,Cost of normal dual motor AWD option is $5k. Range is also 310 miles. Takes 0-60mph to 4.5 sec &amp; top speed to 140 mph.
1,@PPathole Black &amp; white interior available only for Model 3 Performance initially due to limited parts availability. Will broaden over time.
1,Tesla AWD is dual motor; so you can fully drive the car even if one breaks
1,Cost of all options; wheels; paint; etc  is included (apart from Autopilot). Cost is $78k. About same as BMW M3; but 15% quicker &amp; with better handling. Will beat anything in its class on the track.
1,Tesla dual motor; all-wheel drive performance Model 3: 3.5 sec  0-60mph  155 mph Top Speed 310 mile Range
1,@plot_qasc It’s only slightly more expensive to Tesla (same price to car owners); but owner happiness is way higher; so worth doing
1,@clemyeung Exactly
1,Will soon enable Tesla owners to request service from their phone with a few taps. Tesla Ranger will come to you to take care of your car. No need to bring the car in yourself &amp; zero paperwork.
1,@Everman @scottwww @KymmPuckeridge @ElementC9 @griff_golf I’m about to test the configurator &amp; then it goes out to early reservation holders tonight
1,@AddankiSarat You can tweet to Tesla; me and/or get something upvoted in message boards
1,@scottwww @KymmPuckeridge @ElementC9 @griff_golf That is the way to go. Thanks for buying our cars!
1,@DMC_Ryan Also; carbon fiber spoiler; 20” Performance wheels; black &amp; white interior.
1,@DMC_Ryan AC induction front &amp; switched reluctance; partial permanent magnet rear. Silicon Carbide inverters in both. Performance drive units are lot sorted for highest sigma output &amp; get double the burn-in.

1,@andrewbg Time will tell; but so far it appears so
1,@Kasabiii It certainly needs to be better &amp; we work to improve it every day; but perfect is enemy of good. A system that; on balance; saves lives &amp; reduces injuries should be released.
1,What’s actually amazing about this accident is that a Model S hit a fire truck at 60mph and the driver only broke an ankle. An impact at that speed usually results in severe injury or death.
1,It’s super messed up that a Tesla crash resulting in a broken ankle is front page news and the ~40;000 people who died in US auto accidents alone in past year get almost no coverage https://t.co/6gD8MzD6VU
1,@TalkTesla @Techmeme @timkhiggins According to NHTSA; there was an automotive fatality every 86M miles in 2017 (~40;000 deaths). Tesla was every 320M miles. It’s not possible to be zero; but probability of fatality is much lower in a Tesla. We will be reporting updated safety numbers after each quarter.
1,@Techmeme @timkhiggins This is false. Eyetracking rejected for being ineffective; not for cost. WSJ fails to mention that Tesla is safest car on road; which would make article ridiculous. Approx 4X better than avg.

1,@existentialcoms That article was pushed as propaganda to counter IMF study showing fossil fuel subsidies to be $5 trillion/year. Even if $4.9B was true; combined market cap of Tesla &amp; SpaceX is $80B. Where did the other $75B come from? Ass 🎩 …

1,@DMC_Ryan @AnthonyFultz AWD &amp; white interior in July. Air suspension prob later. Note; that’s when we *start* making them. Can’t instantly fill all orders. Will take 6+ months to do so.
1,@existentialcoms Our giant auto co competitors have much greater access to incentives than Tesla; which means Tesla has prospered in spite of govt subsidies; not because of them. Tesla mkt cap has *risen* over time as EV incentives declined. How strange …
1,@AnthonyFultz @DMC_Ryan I love it too; but trying to keep config simple so as not to blow up the production ramp
1,@DMC_Ryan Tesla will enable orders end of next week for dual motor AWD &amp; performance. Starting production of those in July. Air suspension prob next year.
1,@nextspaceflight A cool thing about the design is that’s easy to incorporate branch loops to serve small to mid size cities without slowing down the main loop at all

1,@FredericLambert It will be next level. These are really big numbers.
1,Oh and uh short burn of the century comin soon. Flamethrowers should arrive just in time.
1,@GlobalProTrader @wmiddelkoop True. And once they were on the call; I should have answered their questions live. It was foolish of me to ignore them.
1,@joshgans We went through the same drama on S &amp; X and almost all confirmed in the end. Will likely be even better for Model 3; as customer satisfaction score post delivery is higher. I worry zero about demand. Just spent all night in the factory; not the showroom.
1,Reason RBC question about Model 3 demand is absurd is that Tesla has roughly half a million reservations; despite no advertising &amp; no cars in showrooms. Even after reaching 5k/week production; it would take 2 years just to satisfy existing demand even if new sales dropped to 0.
1,The reason the Bernstein question about CapEx was boneheaded was that it had already been answered in the headline of the Q1 newsletter he received beforehand; along with details in the body of the letter
1,The 2 questioners I ignored on the Q1 call are sell-side analysts who represent a short seller thesis; not investors
1,@MarekCyzio Exactly

1,@Ataraxia_Invest @MKBHD @HyperChangeTV They were neither valid nor pertinent. I will explain why on a primary Twitter thread.
1,@ThePhoenixFlare @MKBHD @HyperChangeTV Yeah; news is actually super good. Model S &amp; X are producing major positive cash flow &amp; Model 3 is about to do same.
1,@MKBHD @HyperChangeTV To be clear; I’m a big fan of MKBHD; but this is an important clarification
1,@MKBHD @HyperChangeTV The “dry” questions were not asked by investors; but rather by two sell-side analysts who were trying to justify their Tesla short thesis. They are actually on the *opposite* side of investors. HyperChange represented actual investors; so I switched to them.

1,@amir Uhh; hello; I need to build cars
1,@amir About a year ago; I asked Doug to manage both engineering &amp; production. He agreed that Tesla needed eng &amp; prod better aligned; so we don’t design cars that are crazy hard to build. Right now; tho; better to divide &amp; conquer; so I’m back to sleeping at factory. Car biz is hell …
1,@amir Can’t believe you’re even writing about this. My job as CEO is to focus on what’s most critical; which is currently Model 3 production. Doug; who I regard as one of the world’s most talented engineering execs; is focused on vehicle engineering.
1,@vegamontesino @NoceraBV @WSJ @Tesla We release as soon as we have the data. Good timeline; bad timing. Doesn’t matter.
1,@NoceraBV @WSJ @Tesla Not criticizing; just as asking questions. I’m sure there’s a really great answer …
1,@WSJ Tesla policy is to issue a recall *before* there are injuries. This is absolutely the right thing to do. Yet there were dozens of recalls by other car companies last month; incl w injuries &amp; deaths; but you only wrote an article about Tesla. Why so?
1,@OmarHoryy @TeslaMotorsClub Seriously! Obviously; I’m not going to do an April Fool’s joke about going bankwupt if I thought there was any chance it would actually happen (sigh).
1,@TeslaMotorsClub Lot of respect for NTSB; but NHTSA regulates cars; not NTSB; which is an advisory body. Tesla releases critical crash data affecting public safety immediately &amp; always will. To do otherwise would be unsafe.

1,@realDonaldTrump To be clear; I think a fair outcome for all is quite likely. China has already shown a willingness to open their markets and I believe they will do the right thing.
1,@realDonaldTrump We raised this with the prior administration and nothing happened. Just want a fair outcome; ideally where tariffs/rules are equally moderate. Nothing more. Hope this does not seem unreasonable.
1,@realDonaldTrump I am against import duties in general; but the current rules make things very difficult. It’s like competing in an Olympic race wearing lead shoes.
1,@realDonaldTrump Also; no US auto company is allowed to own even 50% of their own factory in China; but there are five 100% China-owned EV auto companies in the US
1,@realDonaldTrump For example; an American car going to China pays 25% import duty; but a  Chinese car coming to the US only pays 2.5%; a tenfold difference
1,@realDonaldTrump Do you think the US &amp; China should have equal &amp; fair rules for cars? Meaning; same import duties; ownership constraints &amp; other factors.

1,@doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght Found the source of the problem. The NASA database has the Falcon Block 1 performance. Version currently in production and set to fly in a few months is Block 5. SpaceX GNC team is submitting updated numbers.
1,@kerrbones @nextspaceflight Not enough ignition fluid to light the outer two engines after several three engine relights. Fix is pretty obvious.
1,@nova_road @nextspaceflight A Shortfall of Gravitas
1,@nextspaceflight A third is under construction
1,@DJSnM @doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght Under consideration. We’ve already stretched the upper stage once. Easiest part of the rocket to change. Fairing 2; flying soon; also has a slightly larger diameter. Could make fairing much longer if need be &amp; will if BFR takes longer than expected.
1,@DavideDF_ @doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght Side boosters landing on droneships &amp; center expended is only ~10% performance penalty vs fully expended. Cost is only slightly higher than an expended F9; so around $95M.
1,@AngryPackOMeese @dlxinorbit @doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght Of course :)
1,@AngryPackOMeese @dlxinorbit @doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght Maybe that plan works out; but I will seriously eat my hat with a side of mustard if that rocket flies a national security spacecraft before 2023
1,@dlxinorbit @doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght That was three years ago; before ULA cancelled all medium versions of Delta IV. Future missions have all Delta fixed costs piled on; so their cost is now $600M+ for missions contracted for launch after 2020. Nutty high.
1,@doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght Both exhaust velocity (Isp) and mass ratio drive the rocket equation. Also thrust/mass matters a lot for Oberth effect. Delta upper stage Isp is good; but mass ratio and thrust are not.
1,@doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght The performance numbers in this database are not accurate. In process of being fixed. Even if they were; a fully expendable Falcon Heavy; which far exceeds the performance of a Delta IV Heavy; is $150M; compared to over $400M for Delta IV Heavy.

1,@ShaneAppleton7 @Erdayastronaut Building prototypes is relatively easy; volume production is hard
1,@JaneidyEve Headed to Tesla Fremont factory tomorrow to help with vehicle deliveries
1,@EvaFoxU Biting off more than I can chew. Because I’m an optimistic fool.
1,@Teslarati Hard to believe it’s almost time to retire Cargo Dragon after a decade of solid service
1,@BaconMan65 @PhiliChez Exactly
1,@cleantechnica Will talk about that on Q4 call
1,@EverydayTesla Yeah; engineering is ~90% of my time at SpaceX &amp; about ~60% at Tesla
1,Barrel on dome https://t.co/kpSIJphbnk
1,@ajtourville @cleantechnica Took me an embarrassingly long time to learn that
1,@SteveHamel16 @cleantechnica Sounds about right 🤣🤣
1,@DonaldM38768041 @Erdayastronaut Beyond awesome. He was the real deal.
1,@cleantechnica Seems so long ago
1,@cleantechnica Also; I hate deeply nested classes in C++. Had to be said.
1,@cleantechnica The less code; the better! 1 point for adding a line of code; but 2 points for deleting a line. Bloatware is the devil.
1,@Erdayastronaut Direct drive using several Tesla Plaid motors in parallel for SN1. Simpler; lighter &amp; more fault tolerant. Rear flaps each need ~1.5 megawatts. It’s like moving the entire wing of an aircraft!
1,@TeslaGong @BrianGilbert_ @Tesla @AusTeslaOwners Tesla merch def needs some love; but too many fish to fry rn
1,@TeslaGong @BrianGilbert_ @Tesla @AusTeslaOwners Coming …
1,@ajtourville @Erdayastronaut Tesla uses that to wirebond cells to module current collectors. Is there a commercially available machine that can weld ~4mm full hard 301 stainless barrels &amp; domes?
1,@Kristennetten @SmileSimplify @Erdayastronaut We’re focusing on Boca right now for Starship &amp; Cape is focused on Falcon/Dragon
1,@Erdayastronaut Spin start from COPVs so the ox &amp; fuel turbines spool up super fast in unison. A precise start with full flow staged combustion is very important.
1,@SmileSimplify @Erdayastronaut Moving to an enclosed (fairly) clean room environment for SN2 in Jan; although; unlike aluminum; stainless steel welding is not super sensitive. Our main issue here in Boca is that it can get very windy; which affects weld arc &amp; steel melt pool.
1,@Erdayastronaut No; will be autogenous from the start; tapping hot CH4 &amp; O2 from Raptor
1,@teslaownersSV @TonyCrisostomo @Erdayastronaut Yeah
1,@Erdayastronaut Best would probably be an autogenous laser weld; but we need more precise parts &amp; fixtures. Hopefully get that done in 2020.
1,@Erdayastronaut Almost everything is different. These parts are stamped vs manually bump-formed &amp; TIP TIG welded vs flux core. Higher precision; stronger joints &amp; 20% mass reduction.
1,@DJSnM We use that process for the Raptor nozzle jacket. The knuckles of this dome are stamped in Michigan with a 4000 ton car body press; which costs much less for same outcome.
1,Almost three now. Boca team is crushing it! Starship has giant dome 🤣🤣 https://t.co/qTN2TU02pb
1,@donnyraywoody @flcnhvy @kulpability @NASA Haha true
1,@flcnhvy muffin or not-muffin
1,@realRickyReeves @Erdayastronaut @NASA Crew Dragon is capable of propulsive landing; but would require extensive testing to prove safety. Better to focus on Starship.
1,@kulpability @NASA New technology development schedules tend to exhibit a version of Zeno’s Paradox — at any given point; you’re halfway there
1,@kulpability @NASA Crew Dragon should be physically ready &amp; at the Cape in Feb; but completing all safety reviews will probably take a few more months

1,@BrianGilbert_ @Tesla @AusTeslaOwners Tesla app based payment will soon be rolled out WW. It’s tough making functionality work across so many regulatory domains.
1,@BrianGilbert_ @Tesla @AusTeslaOwners Is purchasing through the Tesla app not working?
1,@teslaownersSV @iam_preethi I def believe in the ethical treatment of animals &amp; taking action of climate; but these are mostly separate moral issues
1,@EvaFoxU @TeslaHistorian @TeslaOwnersofMA @JohnnaCrider1 @vincent13031925 @boringcompany Nice
1,@teslaownersSV @iam_preethi Renewable energy production (solar; wind; geothermal); improving home insulation &amp; electric transport will do the trick. Vegan/vegetarian helps a little; but isn’t critical. We should take the set of actions that maximize total public happiness!
1,@iam_preethi I support people choosing whatever diet makes them happy; but it’s true that everyone going vegan still wouldn’t stop climate change. Moving billions of tons of hydrocarbons from deep underground into the atmosphere &amp; oceans is fundamentally the issue.
1,Dam now rly want choc chip muffin
1,@28delayslater @TeslaOwnersofMA @JohnnaCrider1 @vincent13031925 @boringcompany Slight tweak to the glass needed &amp; then it should be good to go

1,@JohnnaCrider1 @vincent13031925 @boringcompany Yeah; Boring Bricks 🧱 are def coming; but whole team is focused on getting Vegas Convention Center tunnel operational so people can try it out; suggest improvements; etc. I ♥️ crowdsourcing ideas with people who really care about making great products!
1,@vincent13031925 @boringcompany Certainly worth trying! The objective reality for large cities worldwide is that efforts to solve traffic have not worked well. If we don’t try *something* new; we will be in traffic hell forever.
1,@JonAttenborough @cFidd Absolutely. Multi-level tunnels can go under buildings; mountains; rivers or anything else &amp; directly connect destinations; like aircraft do in the sky. We just need more of them.
1,@ollie_turrell @cFidd Pretty much
1,@Snipergen @Tesla Sure. Trax will get much better &amp; more fun. This is an alpha version.
1,@cFidd No; I said we should build more tunnels. Put trains in them or cars or whatever; but every large city on Earth is plagued by traffic &amp; it’s getting worse. Multi-level tunnels might solve this; so worth trying. If you have a better suggestion; please tell us what it is.
1,@RationalEtienne @EvaFoxU @amargosavalley That might have something to do with it. “Stalin: Court of the Red Tsar” was one of the few books so dark I had to stop reading. If only they’d listened to Lenin’s last wish; much tragedy may have been averted.
1,@EvaFoxU @amargosavalley For sure; but I understand the pulse of Twitter pretty well. A sudden avalanche of very similar vitriolic comments from anon accounts usually means someone activated a troll/bot net.
1,@amargosavalley Thousands of anon/troll/bot accounts suddenly on the attack. Interesting.
1,@SMZGallagher @Tesla Sorry about this. We will do our best. The Tesla production &amp; delivery teams have been working super hard.

1,@austinbarnard45 @flcnhvy @Joe__Wakefield @tjq1190 @tyger_cyber @fawfulfan @_Mikemo To pay rent; we turned our house into a nightclub &amp; charged a $5 entry fee. Looked cool at night; but insane by day … blacklights; luminescent spray paint &amp; metal junk sculptures.
1,@kimbal 🖤 you too
1,@catmonocle69 Sounds like a Marxist with style
1,@flcnhvy @cyrusposting Exactly
1,@cyrusposting Induced demand is one of the most irrational theories I’ve ever heard. Correlation is not causation. If the transport system exceeds public travel needs; there will be very little traffic. I support anything that improves traffic; as this negatively affects almost everyone.
1,@Joe__Wakefield @austinbarnard45 @tjq1190 @tyger_cyber @fawfulfan @_Mikemo This is a pretty awful lie. I left South Africa by myself when I was 17 with just a backpack &amp; suitcase of books. Worked on my Mom’s cousin’s farm in Saskatchewan &amp; a lumber mill in Vancouver. Went to Queens Univ with scholarship &amp; debt; then same to UPenn/Wharton &amp; Stanford.
1,@austinbarnard45 @tjq1190 @tyger_cyber @fawfulfan @_Mikemo This person blocked me; so can’t read the tweet. Whats their deal?
1,@IrinaAntony @tjq1190 @tyger_cyber @fawfulfan @_Mikemo We started Zip2 with ~$2k from me plus my overclocked home-built PC; ~$5k from my bro &amp; ~$8k from Greg Kouri (such a good guy — he is greatly missed).  My Dad provided 10% of a ~$200k angel funding round much later; but by then risk was reduced &amp; round would’ve happened anyway.
1,@tjq1190 @tyger_cyber @fawfulfan @_Mikemo He didn’t own an emerald mine &amp; I worked my way through college; ending up ~$100k in student debt. I couldn’t even afford a 2nd PC at Zip2; so programmed at night &amp; website only worked during day. Where is this bs coming from?
1,@geofficient Pretty much
1,@justpaulinelol @annerajb Probably 2021. Depends on regulatory approvals.
1,@annerajb Hopefully working in Caribbean by end of 2020. Def by 2021.
1,@waitbutwhy @Kurz_Gesagt Maximizing conversion of mass to aimed photons (pure momentum) is actually the highest possible efficiency; which is why an antimatter drive is probably the best way to get to other star systems with known physics. For “close” stars; a laser sail is good too.
1,@TheAssassin_95 Yes; but it’s too secret
1,@Erdayastronaut @teslaownersSV @Benioff Hopefully fully operational in 2020
1,@teslaownersSV @Benioff Boring Co is completing its first commercial tunnel in Vegas; going from Convention Center to Strip; then will work on other projects
1,@flcnhvy No; he’s still much faster 🐌
1,These would be road tunnels for zero emissions vehicles only — no toxic fumes is the key. Really; just an underground road; but limited to EVs (from all auto companies). This is not in place of other solutions; eg light rail; but supplemental to them.
1,@teslaownersSV Done by dawn
1,@Salo4201 That would be a fringe benefit 🤣🤣
1,Build super safe; Earthquake-proof tunnels under cities to solve traffic
1,@JaneidyEve Flight is hopefully 2 to 3 months away
1,@JaneidyEve We’re now building flight design of Starship SN1; but each SN will have at least minor improvements; at least through SN20 or so of Starship V1.0.

1,@DiscoverMag Please stop spamming bleak links into a paywall
1,@Teslarati Activating engine two …
1,@KakaroTTo1385 @flcnhvy @Sofiaan @Erdayastronaut It is an honor &amp; a privilege to work with so many great engineers
1,@flcnhvy @Sofiaan @Erdayastronaut The overarching goal of Tesla engineering is maximize area under user happiness curve
1,@flcnhvy @Sofiaan @Erdayastronaut It’s not that these things can’t be done; they just absorb a lot of software engineering time; which has great opportunity cost. There are very few excellent software engineers &amp; merely increasing team size results in awful bloatware.
1,@Kristennetten Future feature
1,Turn on auto navigate feature &amp; car will activate traffic-based navigation to work; home or calendar; depending on context; as soon as you sit down. No input required at all.
1,@Sofiaan @Erdayastronaut Possible; but one step at a time. Anything we release to the fleet has big implications these days. For example; if someone’s on data roaming &amp; video is enabled; they will get a giant cell phone bill. Operating in 40+ countries results in many corner cases!
1,@JeremyGreenlee @mobiledavidd Seeing B pillar (diagonal fwd) &amp; side repeater (diagonal back) camera views would probably help for tight situations. We can enable access to these views. Also; no problem to have option to disable auto lock for home.
1,@mobiledavidd We’re building out Superchargers as fast as possible! Need to ramp V3 Supercharger production.
1,@Erdayastronaut Phone notification with ability to view possibly relevant still images is no problem. Live video from several cameras is too much bandwidth.
1,@Erdayastronaut Most people still don’t know it’s there
1,Just swipe down on Tesla nav button for car to automatically navigate to home; work or destination in calendar
1,@TesLatino @teslaownersSV @tesla_unplugged @TeslaOwnersofMA @Tesla @disneyplus @BenSullins If you enter a longer distance than range; system should autonav to optimal Superchargers along the way. Is it not doing this correctly?

1,@jamescharles Yer welcome son
1,@teslaownersSV @tesla_unplugged @TeslaOwnersofMA @Tesla @disneyplus @BenSullins Car should autonavigate to destinations based on your calendar. If nothing in calendar; should do work in morning &amp; home in evening. Future versions will guess based on prior patterns (if preference enabled).

1,@v_g_fischer @mayemusk Yeah; 1978 320i that I bought in ‘93 for $1400. I hotrodded it by jamming in a 5 speed transmission from a later model I found in a Philly junkyard when the 4 speed transmission failed.
1,@mayemusk Couldn’t afford to pay for repairs; so I fixed almost everything on that car from parts in the junkyard. Ironically; that’s me replacing broken side window glass. The circle is complete lol.

1,@Real_John_D @Teslarati @tesla_raj There will be no loss of either
1,@flcnhvy @Teslarati @tesla_raj That will require a full redesign; but probably ~73 inches or ~185 cm width
1,@Everman @Teslarati @tesla_raj True; more for parking at destination. Really needs to fit in same external envelope as a full-size SUV; but with better height control with air suspension; so it can fit in low clearance parking garages.
1,@Teslarati @tesla_raj We can prob reduce width by an inch &amp; maybe reduce length by 6+ inches without losing on utility or esthetics. Min height is below 75 inches when air suspension set to low. Will post exact number soon.

1,@Erdayastronaut Really? Ok sure.
1,@vicentes Hardcore body engineers will understand this at a profound level

1,⚔️ Study the Blade!! ⚔️ https://t.co/cvuW1TmcjI
1,@annerajb @flcnhvy We’re creating this alloy at Tesla. Not a problem to create a lot of it; but we’ll need to come up with new body manufacturing methods; as it can’t be made using standard methods.
1,@flcnhvy Starship steel decision came first. We were going to use titanium skins for Cybertruck; but cold-rolled 30X stainless is much stronger.
1,Even bending it requires a deep score on inside of bend; which is how the prototype was made
1,Reason Cybertruck is so planar is that you can’t stamp ultra-hard 30X steel; because it breaks the stamping press

1,Franz throws steel ball at Cybertruck window right before launch. Guess we have some improvements to make before production haha. https://t.co/eB0o4tlPoz
1,🖤🖤🖤 Syd Mead 🖤🖤🖤 https://t.co/8nbD5LrAQJ
1,@reecethesaxman We threw same steel ball at same window several times right before event &amp; didn’t even scratch the glass!
1,Better truck than an F-150; faster than a Porsche 911. Order Cybertruck online at https://t.co/hltT8dg2NO
1,@JRussell614 Will be an option to add solar power that generates 15 miles per day; possibly more. Would love this to be self-powered. Adding fold out solar wings would generate 30 to 40 miles per day. Avg miles per day in US is 30.
1,@MoeSargi Tesla 2 person electric ATV will come at first as an option for Cybertruck
1,Nobody *expects* the Cybertruck https://t.co/khhYNFaVKs
1,@tesla_addicted @DMC_Ryan Haha
1,@DMC_Ryan High time we had a Tesla coil!
1,@ElenMatvievska @Tesla Coming soon! We’re working to complete the full Supercharger route from London to Shanghai.
1,Tesla Cybertruck (pressurized edition) will be official truck of Mars
1,@ward069 Of course
1,@WillFealey @Tesla Fun party guaranteed!
1,Long journey
1,Tonight
1,@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Absolutely; but to move to Mk3 design. This had some value as a manufacturing pathfinder; but flight design is quite different.
1,@MKBHD Maybe won’t need a key at all
1,@TeslaTested So many reporters gave Chanos airtime when he called Tesla a worthless fraud. Now that he has been proven wrong; silence …

1,@mrclipsmaniac Cephalopods have a strange intelligence
1,@justpaulinelol @universal_sci It certainly does
1,@universal_sci True
1,@teslaownersSV @Teslarati Not sure. Maybe write or message carmakers who oppose the environmental initiative?
1,@Teslarati Even Toyota; who made the Prius. That is sad.
1,@Kristennetten @farrxy @Ford Guess I was obsessed with space from an early age. Fair point.
1,@farrxy @Ford I’d be way too embarrassed to put that on a Tesla. It’s like a kid’s drawing.
1,@Ford Congratulations on the Mach E! Sustainable/electric cars are the future!! Excited to see this announcement from Ford; as it will encourage other carmakers to go electric too.
1,@flcnhvy Exactly! Well said.
1,@cleantechnica Surprisingly common
1,Cybertruck unveil Thursday night https://t.co/AHBxaubdhO
1,Innovation comes in many ways
1,@arstechnica @SciGuySpace Meaning not fair that Boeing gets so much more for the same thing
1,@arstechnica @SciGuySpace This doesn’t seem right
1,@cleantechnica True
1,@davidtrover Seems likely. 🧝‍♂️🧝‍♂️ = hipsters.
1,@flcnhvy @neuralink Right now; trajectory of neuro-silicon symbiosis doesn’t appear to intersect trajectory of AGI. Goal of Neuralink is to raise this probability above 0.0%.

1,Congrats to Tesla team on Model 3 winning best midsize car in Germany! 🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪 https://t.co/4CDTf4c3eC
1,Will build batteries; powertrains &amp; vehicles; starting with Model Y
1,@KenHowery Congratulations!
1,Starlink vertical on the pad https://t.co/WuiB1piKcK
1,@getjeda @Tesla Haha
1,@flcnhvy @SciGuySpace @yokem55 @waynehale Exactly
1,@SciGuySpace @yokem55 @waynehale Without a fully &amp; rapidly reusable orbital rocket; humanity will never be a multiplanet species
1,@lexfridman Bad logic is always ugly
1,@bluemoondance74 @flcnhvy Deleting throttle allows the engine to achieve max thrust on max thrust variant. Other variants will have throttle.
1,@bluemoondance74 @flcnhvy SpaceX engine production is gearing up to build about a Raptor a day by next year; so up to 365 engines per year. Most will be the (as high as) 300 ton thrust (but no throttle &amp; no gimbal) variant for Super Heavy. Cumulative thrust/year could thus be as high as 100;000 tons/year.
1,@bluemoondance74 @flcnhvy Raptor is evolving rapidly. Probably wouldn’t consider it to be even V1.0 until roughly engine 50; although probably engines 12+ can be retrofitted for orbital flight; especially on Super Heavy; which is less sensitive to engine variation. It just needs crazy up force!
1,@jchybow @teslaownersSV @flcnhvy Pretty much
1,@leo_cadle @teslaownersSV @flcnhvy Exactly! It’s also a far more exciting &amp; inspiring future if consciousness is out there among the stars; than forever confined to Earth until some eventual extinction event; however far in the future that may be (hopefully; very far).
1,@teslaownersSV @flcnhvy No; in the beginning; assuming you even make it there alive; Mars will be far more dangerous &amp; difficult than Earth &amp; take decades of hard labor to make self-sufficient. That’s the sales pitch. Want to go?
1,@teslaownersSV @flcnhvy So it will take about 20 years to transfer a million tons to Mars Base Alpha; which is hopefully enough to make it sustainable
1,@teslaownersSV @flcnhvy As the planets align only once every two years
1,@teslaownersSV @flcnhvy A thousand ships will be needed to create a sustainable Mars city
1,@Malcolmmarsman @flcnhvy No problem. We could program Starship to perform Swan Lake in the sky. Minimizing landing burn propellant mass is what’s hard.
1,@flcnhvy Current global payload to orbit capacity is about 500 tons per year; of which Falcon is about half
1,@flcnhvy If we build as many Starships as Falcons; so ~100 vehicles &amp; each does 100 tons to orbit; that’s a capacity of 10 million tons of payload to orbit per year
1,@flcnhvy Payload to orbit per year of Starship fleet is most mind-blowing metric; as it’s designed to fly 3X per day; which is ~1000X per year
1,@flcnhvy The economics have to be something like that to build a self-sustaining city on Mars
1,@cleantechnica Gas/diesel cars too
1,@cleantechnica True
1,Extremism is so fun! (@waitbutwhy) https://t.co/ECACsaqAXR
1,The date is strangely familiar … https://t.co/YZl5R1POJL
1,Cybertruck unveil on Nov 21 in LA near SpaceX rocket factory
1,@uhaveanygrapes @Teslarati Looking into it
1,@FredericLambert @Teslarati The audience of entrepreneurs should try it; not the AF
1,@justpaulinelol @Teslarati Naturally
1,@Teslarati This is based on an incorrect Electrek article. The Air Force asked me to speak at a startup conference called “Pitch Day” &amp; I happened to mention Cybertruck. They don’t buy APCs. It’s the Air Force.
1,@Teslarati Connected; autonomous cars require great software. Advanced factories also require great software. The car industry is not very good at software.
1,@cleantechnica More to come
1,@rafaelcr @OfWudan Would be odd to expect anything else
1,@TJ_Cooney That said; most Starship spaceports will probably need to be ~20 miles / 30km offshore for acceptable noise levels; especially for frequent daily flights; as would occur for point to point flights on Earth
1,@TJ_Cooney Wow; 2011 seems like eons ago! With fairing recovery; Falcon is ~80% reusable; but reflight takes several days &amp; requires boats. Starship will be fully reusable with booster reflight possible every few hours &amp; ship reflight every 8 hours. No boats needed.
1,@flcnhvy Great poem
1,Great work by SpaceX Dragon team &amp; Airborne! To be clear; we’ve only done 1 multi-parachute test of Mk3 design; so 9 more left to reach 10 successful tests in a row.
1,@Teslarati Putting Model S in range mode is the opposite of launch mode; as it minimizes performance in favor of range. Show should be called “Low Gear”!
1,Tesla Solarglass vs 🎃  Happy Halloween!! https://t.co/p5tXeJYqne
1,@stephenpallotta @Teslarati Sorry; Drag Times is correct; Top Gear is wrong
1,@Teslarati Drag Race Times analysis is correct. Also; there’s a software upgrade for Model S coming out that increases peak power by 50HP; so Model S should beat Porsche Taycan Turbo S by a wider margin in 0 to 60 &amp; 1/4 mile races.
1,@TeslaNY Walking on a Tesla Solarglass roof is definitely no problem!
1,Thank for helping grow sustainable energy through solar!
1,@tobi @chris__lu @MarkRober @MrBeastYT Congrats! Shopify is great btw. Nice work.
1,@flcnhvy The fires are all too real
1,@NutaIie Haha true
1,@johnkrausphotos @NASA @Space_Station Hard to say with high accuracy; but 4 to 6 weeks is my best guess
1,Soon; SpaceX will launch @NASA astronauts to @Space_Station!
1,@themuskbros @teslaownersSV That’s significantly improved in current production
1,@RenataKonkoly @MrBeastYT @MKBHD True; my name literally means tree
1,@teslaownersSV If you have autonav enabled; car will automatically navigate either to address in calendar; to work if you’re home &amp; to home if at work. Not sure if that’s in wide release yet; but def in early access. It’s an awesome feature.
1,“I always like going South; somehow; it feels like going downhill.”
1,For Treebeard
1,@MKBHD @MrBeastYT Ok; sounds legit; will donate 1M trees
1,@MrBeastYT Sounds cool. Where are the trees being planted &amp; what kind of trees?
1,@Jason @kylegrantham Making a roof out of kindling in a fire risk zone is not recommended
1,@Jon4Lakers @Tesla We’re changing this from storm watch to disaster watch to cover fires; earthquakes; etc
1,@kylegrantham Very true. Glass doesn’t burn &amp; melting point is extremely high; so much more resilient than asphalt or wood roofs.
1,@realDiegoMonroy I hate advertising
1,Unfortunately; it’s hard to google Tesla solar links due to tons of ads &amp; SEO. Go to https://t.co/UvQa8JOE7v to add solar to an existing roof &amp; https://t.co/D9yUuL7NVE for a new roof with integrated solar.
1,We don’t make much money on this product; so $1000 actually means a lot
1,If you’re directly affected by wildfire power outages; Tesla is reducing Solar+Powerwall prices by $1000 as of today
1,Apologies to those waiting for Solar/Powerwall outside California; as we are prioritizing those affected by wildfires
1,@jasondunn So true. Imagine if phones were gasoline powered. Total sales would be like 14 units worldwide! Using oil/gas &amp; being forced to constantly visit toxic chemical dispensing stations will seem so insane in the future!
1,Homes with solar sell for 4.1% more; according to Zillow. Adding a Powerwall battery is highly likely to increase home value too imo; as security against blackouts is increasingly important.  https://t.co/3y4M5L50qF
1,@flcnhvy @teslaownersSV I’d recommend regular solar panels for flat roofs
1,@starshipsara Extremely high
1,@teslaownersSV Will do what we can for anyplace affected by natural disasters
1,US clean energy incentive drops by 4% on Jan 1; so orders must be received by roughly Nov 15 to be installed in time

1,@HarryStoltz1 That would be cool. Surfaces that see the sun should be alive with power; not inert!
1,Maybe call Tesla solar roof tiles product Solarglass? Like Dragonglass; but solar!
1,@TeslaNY @SpaceX Gwynne rocks! Starlink will probably be a little bumpy at first; but then improve rapidly.
1,@longnow @Liv_Boeree Strange to think that our civilization is only ~5000 years old; if dated from earliest writing. Less than the lifespan of a fruit fly; compared to age of Earth.
1,To be clear; integrated solar tiles only make financial sense for new houses or replacement roofs. If your roof is more than 5 years away from replacement; solar retrofit is recommended https://t.co/mDoPO17YB9
1,@flcnhvy This product may appear simple; but actually *very* difficult to get right
1,Will do an open call Q&amp;A
1,@GerberKawasaki @Tesla Major FUD incoming for sure … haha
1,@flcnhvy I have V1; but will switch to V3

1,@Erdayastronaut @NotEricRalph @MartianDays @torybruno @AerojetRdyne Need to deal with thrust asymmetry from flameout of an engine without forcing shutdown of opposing pair engine; which would double thrust loss. Also; thrust differential doesn’t solve roll control well.
1,@WorldAndScience Common myth; but incorrect
1,@slashdot And so begins the robocalypse …
1,Tesla wins best headlights award 🥇 https://t.co/8yfeJiXd0N
1,@Teslarati The final configuration used at Nürburgring to set the record will go into production around summer 2020; so this is not merely for the track
1,Anyone who’s interested in working on cutting edge manufacturing — designing &amp; building the machine that makes the machine — please consider working at Tesla or SpaceX. We’re gonna take this to a whole new level!
1,@Erdayastronaut Tesla team has done an incredible job with Giga Shanghai. Honored to work with them. I’m in awe.
1,So much respect for those doing high volume manufacturing. It’s insanely hard; but you make a real thing that people value. My hat is off to you …
1,@RationalEtienne @LaurenRow5 @EvaFoxU @JohnnaCrider1 @Kristennetten @vincent13031925 @28delayslater @Sofiaan @hamids @InsideEVs Tesla is first American car company to achieve sustained volume production in past ~100 years. Hardest; most painful thing I’ve ever been through; including getting Falcon to orbit.
1,@RationalEtienne @LaurenRow5 @EvaFoxU @JohnnaCrider1 @Kristennetten @vincent13031925 @28delayslater @Sofiaan @hamids @InsideEVs Prototypes are easy; but achieving volume production of a new technology is insanely hard
1,And the lead character is also named Woody https://t.co/ZxK84rB020
1,@NotEricRalph @MartianDays @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @AerojetRdyne Yeah; gimbal SL engines at min throttle for control; so most of impulse goes through vac engines
1,@TTownJoe @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Conservation of energy tells you the answer
1,@Ingvar_Oolsen @neiltyson @Space_Station Looking forward to Kerbal 2!
1,@MartianDays @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @AerojetRdyne We def could be wrong about this; but it’s actually good to fix high efficiency vacuum engines with giant nozzles in place &amp; only thrust vector engines with smaller nozzles. Don’t need a lot of room &amp; moment of inertia is much lower.
1,@nextspaceflight @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Also; we’re keeping area ratio low enough to fire Raptor Vac at sea level without flow separation; so that’s leaving a lot on the table
1,@nextspaceflight @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Couple months; but V1.0 of Raptor Vac is suboptimal; as optimized for speed of development. Isp maybe 365 to 370 sec.
1,@Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Max thrust version of Raptor should achieve true T/W &gt; 170. Target is 1.5 ton engine with &gt;260 t-F. Max Isp version should achieve ~380 sec; but T/W probably &lt;120 due to big nozzle. These are just guesses for now.
1,@Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Oberth effect is not well appreciated. Value of high thrust low in gravity well is not captured in simple delta-v equation. One of the reasons we favor CH4 over H2. https://t.co/LijrUMuJDq
1,@torybruno @Erdayastronaut @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne This is true. All that matters is number used in ∆v equation. Propellant residuals are incredibly important; often overwhelming engine mass. https://t.co/s2LcEapGAU
1,@HarryStoltz1 @neiltyson @Space_Station Big challenge for Starship refueling on the moon is finding sources of carbon. Probably some pretty big deposits in craters from meteorites. Same goes for hydrogen &amp; oxygen; also in (shadowed) craters.
1,@teslaownersSV @Sofiaan @annerajb @tesla_addicted We’re working on a simple initial version of Autopark. Will be safe; but sometimes park in silly places that aren’t actual parking spaces.
1,@Sofiaan @annerajb @tesla_addicted Yeah; great team!
1,@J_ump_er @neiltyson @Space_Station To be precise; r is distance from center of masses of two objects. Center of mass of Earth is ~6400km; so gravity change is small at Space Station altitude; which is ~6800km from center of Earth. https://t.co/21hICWczMq
1,@HarryStoltz1 @neiltyson @Space_Station Exactly. And you can on the moon; since it has no atmosphere.
1,@neiltyson @Space_Station Most people aren’t aware that orbit (and “zero” gravity) is all about horizontal speed; not altitude. A spacecraft needs to travel about 25 times the speed of sound to stay in space.
1,@NASASpaceflight @IanPineapple Yeah; will be Raptor vertical test stand. Hopefully allows simplification of Raptor design; as pump shaft wear &amp; drainage is better in vertical config. Also; more representive of flight. Test as you fly …
1,@tesla_addicted Will start rendering traffic cones in the display soon
1,@flcnhvy @aquastorm Venus would be very difficult

1,Price for fully installed solar plus battery has been reduced ~10% to help those affected by blackouts
1,@brockm Yes; but probably a year or two away. Lot of fish to fry …
1,@bruce_mittleman Tesla cannot continue to lose money. To achieve our goal of environmental sustainability; Tesla must be financially sustainable or we will cease to exist.
1,@cutza7 When the car is FSD without supervision; ie robotaxi; you’ll be able to earn far more than monthly lease/loan cost by allowing others to use it. Managing a small fleet of robotaxis will be a career for many &amp; much better than driving a single car.
1,@tesla_addicted @sanjeev_r11 @vincent13031925 Putting panels on east or west facing roofs works well too. Energy loss is fairly minor. Just north facing that’s problematic above ~30 deg latitude.
1,@annerajb @Thebault_Arthur Working with engineering team to figure out best way to do upgrade without crushing service team. Will start doing upgrades in volume in a few months; coincident with more FSD features being released.
1,@Thebault_Arthur Still working with RDW; the car regulatory authority in Netherlands. Unclear why there’s a delay. Other countries are supportive.

1,@OranMaliphant @Erdayastronaut @AngelNDevil2 @MarkChica @FutureJurvetson @bluemoondance74 @SpaceX That’s about right; except no sensors. Tile itself is the sensor as it will partially ablate where too hot &amp; have to be replaced.
1,@AngelNDevil2 @MarkChica @FutureJurvetson @bluemoondance74 @SpaceX It’s all the “secondary” structure that concerns me; not engines &amp; primary airframe
1,@AngelNDevil2 @MarkChica @FutureJurvetson @bluemoondance74 @SpaceX Raptor cost is tracking to well under $1M for V1.0. Goal is &lt;$250k for V2.0 is a 250 ton thrust-optimized engine; ie &lt;$1000/ton
1,@RationalEtienne @LaurenRow5 @EvaFoxU @Kristennetten @SteveHamel16 @TheElonMasked @MemesOfMars @MichellBasler @mayemusk @kimbal Agreed &amp; such a heartwarming photo ♥️
1,@Kristennetten @SS4Adrian I have that exact thought every time I get the flu
1,@SS4Adrian Clearly a sign of the apocalypse!
1,@engineers_feed Lot of ways to melt &amp; join steel. Mostly just needs to be welded consistently &amp; with precise parts.
1,@engineers_feed Thankfully not. FSW is very difficult to get right &amp; not needed with steel.
1,Production version will be a lot more polished than this prototype; but still fun to see
1,@ColinPearceUK Bigger flaps/fins at rear also moves center of pressure back
1,@TrevorMahlmann Haha yes
1,@HarryStoltz1 In solving for a good Mars climate; we will learn a great deal about how to do so on Earth. It is the inverse problem.

1,@Erdayastronaut @Cor_SPACE There’s so much power going through this engine that it’s close to the limit of the known physics of materials in many places
1,@flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @Cor_SPACE No; we’ve been focusing on production (now on SN12). Only need 250 bar or even a bit less for Starship/Super Heavy. Anything above 250 is nice to have &amp; we’ll get around to it; but not needed for flight.
1,@NCBirbhan @Erdayastronaut @Cor_SPACE Probably around 6 or 7pm
1,@Erdayastronaut @Cor_SPACE What blows my mind is that peak pressure in regen chamber &amp; nozzle is *far* above combustion pressure at over 800 bar or ~12;000 psi
1,@GaryTheBot_ Figure of speech
1,Meanwhile; back in reality

1,Three Raptors on a Starship https://t.co/UrRiD62EVk
1,@SpacePadreIsle @SpaceX Wow; it’s been 5 years since we started at Boca!
1,@BrendanCogbill7 About a week. Will include slight improvements; based on initial user feedback.
1,@justpaulinelol We look for rare corner case issues with a limited release US build; then expand internationally as we receive approval from regulatory authorities. So; soon; but hard to say exactly.
1,@GaryTheBot_ Gary; you rock!
1,Tesla V10.0 just started rolling out to all US Tesla owners with FSD option &amp; “advanced download” selected in vehicle software settings

1,If advanced AI (beyond basic bots) hasn’t been applied to manipulate social media; it won’t be long before it is
1,@Wally_Wests Exactly
1,@Kristennetten @annerajb @Jennerator211 @Erdayastronaut That would be a nice touch
1,@flcnhvy @28delayslater @DJSnM This is quite a complex beast; but hopefully within a month or so
1,@28delayslater @DJSnM Haha awesome
1,@MarkChica @Kristennetten @TeslaGong @teslaownersSV @Teslatunity @Tesla We could probably do that
1,@TeslaGong @teslaownersSV @Teslatunity @Tesla Not sure we could go quite that tight; but we can for sure allow much narrower spaces at user’s discretion
1,@annerajb @Jennerator211 @Erdayastronaut With rare exceptions; composites would make Starship heavier. They don’t stand up well to high temperatures; but steel does great.
1,@Jennerator211 @Erdayastronaut Mk1 ship is around 200 tons dry &amp; 1400 tons wet; but aiming for 120 by Mk4 or Mk5. Total stack mass with max payload is 5000 tons.
1,@teslaownersSV @Teslatunity @Tesla Absolutely
1,@Teslatunity @Tesla You’re welcome! Feature requests always appreciated.
1,@Erdayastronaut @kimitalvitie Six. Two windward; one under each fin &amp; two leeward. Provides redundancy for landing on unimproved surfaces.

1,@tannerfox Impressive work by Chad &amp; Steve!
1,@SamNazarius @HarryStoltz1 @justpaulinelol @Teslarati Almost entirely C++; but we did have an (advanced for the time) client-side Java app for viewing maps &amp; (weirdly) a 3D hockey game in VRML
1,@justpaulinelol @Teslarati Mostly C/C++; Python &amp; SQL
1,@flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @Tesla It would be pretty embarrassing to use a non-Tesla battery!
1,@Teslarati This includes original engineering of new factory processes &amp; cars. Great engineers will only join if original engineering is supported; not just localization.
1,@Teslarati Tesla is building a major engineering team in China; incl heavy focus on software/firmware for factory &amp; car
1,@The_ShadowZone @DJSnM For sure more than one pass coming back to Earth. To Mars could maybe work single pass; but two passes probably wise.
1,@OranMaliphant @Erdayastronaut Could do it; but we developed low cost reusable tiles that are much lighter than transpiration cooling &amp; quite robust
1,@Erdayastronaut Better just to ride your max temp all the way down &amp; let T^4 be your friend. Lower atmosphere cools you down real fast; so not crazy hot after landing.
1,@DJSnM Exactly. For reusable heatshield; minimize peak heating. For ablative/expendable; minimize total heat. Therefore reusable like Starship wants lift during high Mach reentry for lower peak; but higher total heat.
1,@Erdayastronaut It does actually generate lift in hypersonic regime; which is important to limit peak heating
1,@flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut Many powerful electric motors &amp; batteries. Force required is enormous; as entire fin moves. More about this on the 28th.
1,@Erdayastronaut That’s correct. Essentially controlled falling; like a skydiver.
1,@bopinion Herbert Diess is doing more than any big carmaker to go electric. The good of the world should come first. For what it’s worth; he has my support.

1,Raceway &amp; flap hinge aero covers
1,Just leaving SpaceX Starship build site in Boca https://t.co/Bqt40mSdX4
1,@Erdayastronaut @CptnCrutch5373 @Kalzsom Super Heavy rocket will be much like Falcon 9; but the Ship is a strange combination of Dragon; F9 &amp; a skydiver.
1,@CptnCrutch5373 @Erdayastronaut @Kalzsom Approximately correct. We also fire the ACS thrusters to rotate the vehicle &amp; ignite Raptors at full gimbal angle to complete the turn.
1,@Kalzsom @Erdayastronaut For aero control; it comes down to % of cross-sectional area moving vs not. Flexible as to whether front or rear; so long as within bounds of center of mass &amp; pressure.
1,@Erdayastronaut Current analysis; which I’m not fully bought into; suggests that 2 rear fins with separate airframe-mounted legs will be lighter; so this is the plan for Mk1/Mk2
1,@Erdayastronaut Stability is controlled by (very) rapid movement of rear &amp; fwd fins during entry &amp; landing; as well as ACS thrusters. The smaller leeward “fin” would simply be used as a leg.
1,@Erdayastronaut Stability is not an issue with 3
1,@SpaceXFan97 Nose tip has forward movable fins; cold gas attitude control thrusters; header tanks for landing; composite pressure vessels; several large batteries; etc. Placed up there to balance high mass of Raptors &amp; rear fins at the bottom.
1,@SpaceXFan97 Yes. There’s a huge amount of hardware in the tip of the faring that being integrated on the ground; which is why we haven’t closed it out.
1,Adding the rear moving fins to Starship Mk1 in Boca Chica; Texas https://t.co/HWLihqihph

1,@DMC_Ryan @justpaulinelol @Teslarati Exactly
1,@ElonAccessories @teslaownersSV @flcnhvy @Teslarati Actually; Model 3 would beat the Taycan on Nürburgring over multiple laps; as it has more range
1,@teslaownersSV @flcnhvy @Teslarati No; but very close
1,@DanielCardena @Teslarati Rear facing; but roomier. Great for family gatherings! I did a road trip across America with my five boys &amp; Talulah in the 7 seat Model S several years ago.
1,@flcnhvy @Teslarati Absolutely
1,@justpaulinelol @Teslarati New Roadster and X will come later
1,@ZainRaz4 @Teslarati No; original 5 forward facing seats plus 2 rear-facing smaller seats. The new rear seats will accommodate larger passengers than before.
1,@Teslarati It’s a start. We expect these track times to be beaten by the actual production 7 seat Model S Plaid variant that goes into production around Oct/Nov next year.
1,@BocachicaMaria1 Thanks; I will stop by on the 20th!

1,@TeslaTested Yes; coming soon
1,@TheCriticofvg Oh that would be fun. Will see.
1,Joe Mode is the best mode
1,Thanks Tesla owners. You rock!! ♥️♥️
1,@GaryTheBot_ Wise words from Gary the Bot
1,However; we won’t customize the contract or engage in negotiations. That just causes the Tesla &amp; customer legal bill to be high &amp; drag things out. Pay for clean power; not lawyers! It makes way more sense.
1,Good analysis. You can order commercial solar in literally 30 secs if you use Apple Pay at https://t.co/sCkn87vMa9.
1,@TeslaForLife @teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @Model3Owners Exactly! We’ve only one car factory in California &amp; one Gigafactory (for batteries &amp; drive units) in Nevada. Giga Shanghai will do cars; batteries &amp; drive units for the greater China area. Over time; regional Gigafactories will lower costs &amp; improve logistics worldwide.
1,@teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @Model3Owners Should note that these product mix &amp; logistics errors also results in regional *undersupply*; eg UK &amp; Ireland right now; but we don’t raise the prices even so. The intent; at any given moment in time; is: heads we lose; tails buyers win.
1,@teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @Model3Owners That’s not to say that Tesla people somewhere in the world are being overzealous &amp; possibly overstepping our core principles; which is why I’m looking into it
1,@teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @Model3Owners At end of quarter; there is always some error in product mix allocation between the roughly 40 global regions; due to planning mistakes &amp; logistics problems (Earth is a big place). Small changes in prices are needed to correct local supply/demand imbalances.
1,@Kristennetten @Model3Owners The fundamental operating principle is that prices; while they may change; will change for all equally &amp; should never be a function of bargaining. This is normal for most products; but weirdly not for the auto industry in most parts of the world.
1,@flcnhvy @hoofhrtd1254 @Teslatunity @Model3Owners Agreed
1,@hoofhrtd1254 @Teslatunity @Model3Owners Going to early access (including all who bought FSD) Tesla owners in US next week. If US early access rollout looks good; then rest of world early access owners following week. Might be some delays in EU for regulatory approval.
1,@Teslatunity @Model3Owners There aren’t really meant to be “Tesla incentives”; just general price changes to reflect optimal value of product; as we sometimes get prices of some variants wrong or need to (partially) address shifts in tax incentives. Overarching principle; however; is same deal for all.
1,@Model3Owners Looking into this. A fundamental premise of Tesla is that everyone is offered same terms at same time; ie what you get should never be a function of bargaining.
1,@justpaulinelol @31WA Hopefully; next year

1,@kimpaquette @Tesla For sure!
1,@C3LT_Games Will be answered on 28th
1,@tesla_truth Exactly
1,@kierank_ @Teslarati Looks good
1,@MemesOfMars @Teslarati The mechanical attachment mechanism. We need to make sure they won’t fall off due to vibration &amp; acoustics.
1,@Teslarati The hex tiles are actually mechanically attached; which is important to allow for very high temp on back side of tile that would destroy any adhesive. Marshmellow-looking thing is a rope seal.
1,@Erdayastronaut @JHC2718 @MagnussonMani @vicvic21266 @flcnhvy @DJSnM @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric Failure rate is actually both higher &amp; lower than that; as the Falcon 9 design has changed almost completely several times. Currently flying version has no failures (may fate continue to be merciful); but older versions therefore have a higher failure rate.
1,@Erdayastronaut @IvanEscobosa @DJSnM @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric Precisely
1,@Erdayastronaut @DJSnM @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric Distance from fireball is 0.5*a*t^2; so if t is small; you haven’t moved far even if a is high. At ~6g thrust; you’ll only travel ~0.03m in 100 ms. Pressure wave (aka explosion) with liquid rockets is low; as ox &amp; fuel are poorly mixed. If you can fly out of it; you’re prob ok.
1,@flcnhvy @DJSnM @Erdayastronaut @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric You know destination weather before departure &amp; there’s no weather in space
1,@flcnhvy @DJSnM @Erdayastronaut @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric Everything happens so fast. It’s such a different paradigm that applying aircraft concepts to rockets is almost like applying shipping concepts to aircraft. Travels 10;000 km in 30 mins.
1,@DJSnM @Erdayastronaut @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric Not currently planning for pad abort with early Starships; but maybe we should. Vac engines would be dual bell &amp; fixed (no gimbal); which means we can stabilize nozzle against hull.
1,@Erdayastronaut @DJSnM @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric Raptor turbines can spin up extremely fast. We take it easy on the test stand; but that’s not indicative of capability.
1,@Erdayastronaut @KevinKling12 @DJSnM @spaceXcentric Over time; 355 &amp; 385 are possible; but very difficult
1,@SpaceXFan97 @Erdayastronaut @KevinKling12 @DJSnM @spaceXcentric Most likely

1,@flcnhvy @Freiraum77 @SpaceX Probably 2 to 3 months. We’re about to ship Raptor SN 10.
1,@Freiraum77 @SpaceX Probably 18m for next gen system
1,@_IAMOtis Would love to; but import duties are extremely high; even for electric vehicles
1,@mralbertsun Should be. Will fix.
1,Also; u can order online at https://t.co/46TXqRJ3C1 in 2 mins; have car delivered to ur doorstep &amp; return for full refund

1,@PPathole @Teslarati Yes; rather embarrassing tbh
1,@Teslarati Impressively accurate analysis!
1,@MemesOfMars @cleantechnica Hopefully next year
1,@teslaownersSV Appears to be a wiring/connector issue
1,Igniters need to be inspected. We will try again tomorrow same time.

1,World’s first very large scale battery has worked out well https://t.co/X7gdbL8U5b
1,@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Yes; last flight for Hopper. If all goes well; it will become a vertical test stand for Raptor.
1,@FuzionPlaysTV @teslaownersSV Exactly! Especially let your PUC commissioners/authorities know.
1,@flcnhvy Agreed; that’s the right future
1,Looks like @SpaceX Starhopper flight may be as soon as Monday. FAA support is much appreciated!
1,@aikisteve We’re working closely with EU regulators &amp; hope to clarify the timeline soon
1,@Erdayastronaut @DKled007 @AKawakbi @newscientist Should be soon
1,If you’re a utility or public utilities commission; please consider using the Tesla Megapack. Better for the environment &amp; usually lower cost than fossil fuel peaker plants! https://t.co/Ls4IfB0d6a

1,@TeslaTrip @arctechinc We need to complete internal QA testing for safety; which will hopefully be done in about 4 weeks
1,@arctechinc Everyone who bought FSD will receive priority/early access
1,Price increase for Tesla FSD postponed until version 10 with smart summon is in wide release; which is about 4 to 8 weeks away; depending on how early access goes
1,@justpaulinelol Not risky imo &amp; can be adjusted/improved real-time. Essentially need to figure out most effective way to convert mass to energy; as Mars is slightly too far from this solar system’s fusion reactor (the sun).
1,@wingod @DJSnM @ThePhoenixFlare True; diverting a comet would be super hard. Could be done with small asteroids &amp; a mass driver; but this is risky.
1,Nuke Mars refers to a continuous stream of very low fallout nuclear fusion explosions above the atmosphere to create artificial suns. Much like our sun; this would not cause Mars to become radioactive.
1,@JaneidyEve Will probably make sense to do this when Starship Mk 1 has 3 Raptors; moving body fins &amp; landing gear installed; which is hopefully mid September
1,@HarryStoltz1 @ThePhoenixFlare Will be converted to Raptor vertical test stand
1,@ThePhoenixFlare Trickier than it may seem on Mars; as atmospheric density is 1% that of Earth &amp; gravity is 38%; but doable for localized warming
1,Might make sense to have thousands of solar reflector satellites 🛰 to warm Mars vs artificial suns (tbd)
1,@SciGuySpace @hover389 AF certification required an enormous amount of work. It’s mostly design-review based; not flight-based.

1,@bluemoondance74 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Just spoke with FAA; so hopefully yes
1,@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Thanks. Starship; which aspires to be fully &amp; immediately reusable in super heavy class; is a truly 🥜🚀. Even though I’m immersed in Starship/Raptor design &amp; build 7 days/week; it still doesn’t feel real.
1,@ajtourville @marstronauts @Erdayastronaut Approx min payload to Mars to nearest order of magnitude; so at $100k/ton; cost would be $100B
1,@Tesla Powerwall doesn’t need solar panels; but will work fine with both Tesla &amp; non-Tesla solar panels
1,@marstronauts @Erdayastronaut Between $100B and $10T
1,@Erdayastronaut Amazing work over many years by SpaceX engineering/production/launch teams to get (almost) there
1,@Erdayastronaut For sure
1,@justpaulinelol Might take a bit longer to get through regulatory approvals. Likely September.

1,@JaneidyEve @Teslarati No sooner than a week. Working approvals with FAA.
1,@Teslarati Wouldn’t read too much into this. Likely to be fewer F9/FH flights; but possibly an order of magnitude more than these numbers in Starship flights.
1,Thanks George!
1,@brunosilva @vincent13031925 @ResidentSponge @Teslarati @Tesla We’re working with EU regulators to improve rules. Spirit of rules is correct; but exact language doesn’t quite align with spirit. Navigate on Autopilot working well in rest of world.
1,@cleantechnica But actual road data is what matters most https://t.co/q44lsjJZZa
1,@HarryStoltz1 @Sofiaan @IIHS_autosafety @atj721 Ultimately; however; what really matters is empirical safety. Nothing in life is 100% safe; so optimal figure of merit is how many millions of miles/km per accident.
1,@HarryStoltz1 @Sofiaan @IIHS_autosafety @atj721 Good question. NHTSA is great for fundamental structural safety; except for unbelted front passenger occupant factor. Very rare these days for front passenger to be unbelted. NCAP also great; but there are some weird headlight angle factors. Super inside baseball stuff …

1,@hi__hassan Not sure. Will check with my team.
1,@Yashwanthnadal I’m told import duties are extremely high (up to 100%); even for electric cars. This would make our cars unaffordable.
1,@SciGuySpace Orbital refilling is vital to humanity’s future in space. More likely spacecraft to spacecraft (as aircraft do aerial refueling); than a dedicated depot; at least at first.

1,@Erdayastronaut @goathobbit Testing a possible Starship windward side ceramic tile. Maximizing emissivity is best for conductive/particle heating. Nice thing about steel is that tiles can be very thin; unlike carbon fiber or aluminum airframe.
1,@Erdayastronaut @goathobbit Wearing black not recommended https://t.co/lqoBFTeMX2
1,@Erdayastronaut @goathobbit High reflectivity minimizes photonic heating; high emissivity minimizes particle heating. No need to radiate heat away if you aren’t hot in the first place. Also; as metal heats up to yellow/red/white; it stops being reflective.

1,@JeanLikeDenim Probably
1,@ropiko Agreed. That’s approximately date when we expect Enhanced Summon to be in wide release. It will be magical. Lot of hard work by Autopilot team.
1,Cost of Tesla full self-driving option increasing by ~$1000 on August 16
1,@SnazzyQ @PhenomenalPoto @aaronjleonard @tailosivetech Straw man fallacy. To appreciate; your car just needs to be worth more than you paid for it; so probably ~$75k is enough if you bought a 3. FSD will be bundled in all cars (important point). Something is not a commodity if you can’t make enough of them &amp; we won’t be able to.
1,@flcnhvy @SnazzyQ @PhenomenalPoto @aaronjleonard @tailosivetech No; since Tesla will charge a % fee for being in our robotaxi fleet; but it will rise to whatever the clearing price is; otherwise all our cars will be bought by scalpers
1,@SnazzyQ @PhenomenalPoto @aaronjleonard @tailosivetech If we make all cars with FSD package self-driving; as planned; any such Tesla should be worth $100k to $200k; as utility increases from ~12 hours/week to ~60 hours/week
1,@SnazzyQ @tailosivetech Basic white adds too much to service repair complexity. Team convinced me better to go with pearl white.

1,@annerajb @Kristennetten @flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @PatrickLac007 @AngelGPonce @Tesla Haha yes
1,@pbreit @PatrickLac007 @AngelGPonce @Tesla Yes; but owner will have to accept tiny risk of damage. Those are very hard even for careful human drivers.
1,@Kristennetten @annerajb @flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @PatrickLac007 @AngelGPonce @Tesla Yeah; that’s next after summon
1,@annerajb @flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @PatrickLac007 @AngelGPonce @Tesla Will trace back inertial measurements &amp; wheel movements to exit multilevel garage; unless car was teleported into position; in which case all bets are off
1,@flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @PatrickLac007 @AngelGPonce @Tesla Initially; single plane; but hopefully multi-story later this year
1,@Erdayastronaut @PatrickLac007 @AngelGPonce @Tesla Probably 5mph or 8 km/h
1,@PatrickLac007 @AngelGPonce @Tesla Good progress on fast activation of summon down to ~1 second
1,@PatrickLac007 @AngelGPonce @Tesla Parking lots are a remarkably hard problem. Doing an in-depth engineering review of Enhanced Summon later today.
1,@mkaderi @Tesla @samiralley Agreed; it’s a small; but important; feature
1,Also; I stole the idea from Spaceballs  https://t.co/1ozau39PQZ
1,@NatureNews Take note
1,@Erdayastronaut @Tyler0309 @TheVondo About right; but dangerously chuggy &amp; risking bad things at 40%. We’ll keep it above 50% for this flight.
1,@alvianchoiri @joe_mckirdy @13ericralph31 @JHC2718 @StephanieeeeeJ More like 30 to 40 mT to GTO ~27 deg. Plane change is 2*v*sin θ/2; as I recall; but doesn’t matter; as there’s no geo 🛰 anywhere near that mass.
1,@joe_mckirdy @13ericralph31 @JHC2718 @StephanieeeeeJ 100mT to 125mT for true useful load to useful orbit (eg Starlink mission); including propellant reserves. 150mT for reference payload compared to other rockets. This is in fully reusable config. About double in fully expendable config; which is hopefully never.
1,@Erdayastronaut Cont of main
1,@JHC2718 @StephanieeeeeJ We changed the design quite a bit. More about this in late July.

1,@ElonsWorld May the light of consciousness shine bright
1,@bluemoondance74 @Erdayastronaut @justpaulinelol @mayemusk @SpaceX Overall successful. Aborted at T+51 sec on high mixture ratio; but we were intentionally probing the corners of the box of operating conditions; so not surprising.
1,@DisruptResearch @flcnhvy @lexfridman @Tesla Exactly
1,@EVAutonomy @DisruptResearch @flcnhvy @lexfridman @Tesla Sure 🤖 🚘 😀
1,@DisruptResearch @flcnhvy @lexfridman @Tesla To be clear; consumers will still be able to buy a Tesla; but the clearing price will rise significantly; as a fully autonomous car that can function as a robotaxi is several times more valuable than a non-autonomous car
1,@Erdayastronaut @justpaulinelol @mayemusk @SpaceX Between first development engine &amp; first flight engine with operational payload; there are always hundreds of changes to both hardware &amp; software. Over time; thousands.
1,@ElonsBrain @Tesla Upgrading to 250kW soon
1,@kulpability @lexfridman @Tesla Intersections with complex traffic lights &amp; shopping mall parking lots are the two biggest software challenges. Developer branch already mostly works in these scenarios; but massive effort required to get to 99.9999% safety.
1,@austinbarnard45 @tossha_spb @atlasobscura Local supporters will be invited!
1,@dodiewill2 @lexfridman @Tesla End of Q4; most likely
1,@flcnhvy @lexfridman @Tesla Production fully switched over ~3 months ago. Functionality won’t diverge until Q4; as it’s limited by software validation. Will be later for Europe compared to rest of world due to regulatory constraints that were put in place years ago by big ICE companies.
1,@lexfridman @Tesla This is why it’s possible for Tesla to have a million robotaxis by end of 2020 if we upgrade existing HW2 fleet of ~500k &amp; make at least ~500k FSD cars
1,@lexfridman @Tesla All HW2+ cars are upgradable to full self-driving capability with Tesla FSD computer &amp; all production in past few months has FSD computer

1,@Alpsoy66 Is this true @CGrantWSJ?
1,@NebraskaJR @Ninja FWIW; based on calcs I did 10 years ago; cross-over point for Li-ion beating kerosene is ~400 Wh/kg. High cycle batteries are just over 300 Wh/kg today; but probably exceed 400 in ~5 years.
1,@NebraskaJR @Ninja Jet A (kerosene) has much higher energy density than Li-ion; but electric motors weigh much less &amp; convert stored energy to motion better than combustion engines
1,@Ninja Yes; but still a bit too limited on range. That will change in coming years as battery energy density improves.

1,@cleantechnica 2.1 sec 0-60 mph is base model before adding rocket thruster option
1,@bitbased @Antsmash @joseph_preece @Erdayastronaut @SpaceXFan97 @lister6520 @justpaulinelol @MattLBates That’s actually kinda true
1,@SpaceXFan97 @lister6520 @justpaulinelol @MattLBates @Erdayastronaut Almost anything. Length/diameter is much lower &amp; Starship doesn’t have a hammerhead fairing that acts like main sail.
1,@lister6520 @justpaulinelol @MattLBates @Erdayastronaut You’re touching on a good critique of Falcon 9. Our 1st stage to 2nd stage propellant ratio is too high. We’re fixing that with Starship.
1,@baconmashwbs @Canis_Majoris_6 @YusifzadaAgshin That would be unwise. Probably needs a restraint mechanism like Disney’s Space Mountain roller coaster. Would feel similar to Space Mountain in a lot of ways; but you’d exit on another continent.
1,@Canis_Majoris_6 @YusifzadaAgshin ~1000; as all seats would be “coach” &amp; no toilets; pilot area or food galley needed. Most flights would only be 15 to 20 mins. It’s basically an ICBM traveling at Mach 25 that lands.
1,@YusifzadaAgshin About 100; assuming people want cabins. Pressurized volume is similar to A380. Could take a lot more on shorter trips.
1,@ebelliveau @SciGuySpace Frangible would def hurt reusability. Also; presumably those quarter sections are actuated or aero control will be impossible.
1,@SciGuySpace Good to see this. Splitting interstage into 4 sections will have some challenges; but could work.
1,@Cocalarix @romaarra Probably sooner
1,@TherrinKSCVC @SteelSully @annerajb @kickber @ExploreSpaceKSC Sure; that would be an honor
1,@Erdayastronaut @justpaulinelol @MattLBates Most likely. It is programmed to do so.
1,@justpaulinelol @MattLBates @Erdayastronaut High entry force &amp; heat breached engine bay &amp; center engine TVC failed

1,@MattLBates @Erdayastronaut I know … sigh. Those are truly a work of art.
1,@SptlightVids @SpaceX Yes; but we couldn’t take a chance on 2nd stage failing it’s 4th maneuver. This mission was more complex than anything I’m aware of in history of rockets. RIP center core; you did your duty well.
1,Ms. Tree caught the Falcon fairing!!
1,@SpaceXUpdates @Erdayastronaut High payload/delta-V missions will always be far downrange. Value of boost stage is measured (essentially) by *horizontal* velocity imparted to upper stage. Altitude is almost unimportant.

1,@Game_Overlord98 Yeah
1,@RenataKonkoly @Teslarati Yes; the droids can now hold down the center core
1,@Teslarati Odds of center core surviving are about 50% imo; as it’s coming in about 4 times faster than a rifle bullet
1,Falcon Heavy on LC-39A https://t.co/FsfFa7bRRK
1,@Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy All Raptors have slight throttle range by adjusting flow to ox &amp; fuel turbines; but deep throttling imposes limitations on injector stiffness &amp; needs extra hardware. Swear these are legit technical terms 🤗
1,@Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy It’s a factor. Main reason is that FFSC is the ultimate architecture for converting propellant into rocket velocity.
1,@Elthiryel @Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Yes; they run at *much* higher pressure; but lower temperature. Thermal shock &amp; strain are what fatigue Merlin turbine blades. Solvable for high reusability; but better to apply that engineering to Raptor.
1,@SpaceXFan97 @Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Same as last time; although we made a design improvement that could yield about 7 bar more
1,@Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Merlin could probably do 1000 flights too. Turbine blade fatigue cracking would require periodic weld repair or replacement. Probably some seals &amp; bearings as well. Coking not really an issue.

1,@Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Planning on a simplifying mod to Raptor for max thrust; but no throttling; to get to 250 mT level
1,@Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Since Raptor produces 200 tons of force; cost per ton would be $1000. However; Raptor is designed for ~1000 flights with negligible maintenance; so cost per ton over time would actually be ~$1.
1,@DatKlow Chomsky sucks
1,Yet another Monty Python reference; possibly my favorite https://t.co/kzjh26eIEn
1,Anarcho-syndicalism FTW!!
1,@Erdayastronaut @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy More than that now; but &lt;10% of that in volume; although much to be proven
1,@HarryStoltz1 @Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy Full year production is usually ~70% of peak daily rate; so 500/year. Still; non-trivial at 100;000 tons of thrust/year.
1,@Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy Raptor liberated its oxygen turbine stator (appears to be mechanical; not metal combustion failure); so we need to update the design &amp; replace some parts. Production is ramping exponentially; though. SN6 almost done. Aiming for an engine every 12 hours by end of year.

1,Found an old copy of @SignalApp https://t.co/VY357uSeBk
1,@flcnhvy @realkeith @TMSP85 Also HEPA filter is expensive; so would force increase in price
1,@flcnhvy @realkeith @TMSP85 Same
1,@realkeith @TMSP85 Not enough room unless we completely delete front trunk. Model S &amp; X primary HEPA filter alone is literally 1000% bigger than normal car air filter.
1,@TMSP85 S/X HEPA filter is one of my favorite features
1,@BazBarnum @MartinWoolleyUK @ElecVehicleGuy Feedback received. Restoring white interior.
1,@wintonARK Thoughtful model
1,@BdgBill @teslaownersSV @Tesla Based on our data; Autopilot miles appear to be twice as safe as manually driven miles; and we expect this to improve further
1,@AnthonyFinno @RobertOHaver @Tesla Tesla is affecting powerful vested interests. Big auto &amp; oil companies aren’t known for their gentle behavior. SpaceX is battling US military prime contractors &amp; space programs of national govts. No walk in the park there.
1,@13ericralph31 @PPathole @Erdayastronaut @rmarcilhoo @kimitalvitie @SpaceXNow @ChrisG_NSF @NASASpaceflight Yeah; *way* better. Dramatically improves cost; complexity &amp; ease of operations. Distances of ~10;000 km with decent payload seem achievable at roughly Mach 20.
1,@PPathole @Erdayastronaut @rmarcilhoo @kimitalvitie @SpaceXNow @ChrisG_NSF @NASASpaceflight Add 2 to 4 more Raptors for Starship point to point on Earth. You can go surprisingly far; even with low lift/drag. This was an unexpected result.
1,@kimitalvitie @Erdayastronaut @SpaceXNow @ChrisG_NSF @NASASpaceflight Wings/flaps &amp; leg design changing again (sigh). Doesn’t affect schedule much though.
1,@kimitalvitie @Erdayastronaut @SpaceXNow @ChrisG_NSF @NASASpaceflight Not bad
1,@Erdayastronaut @rmarcilhoo @kimitalvitie @SpaceXNow @ChrisG_NSF @NASASpaceflight Exactly. We’re on the wrong planet for SSTO. No problem on Mars or any of the moons.
1,@Teslatunity @Everman @AndyKiersz Yeah; the fear; uncertainty &amp; doubt propaganda campaign being pushed by those betting against Tesla has reached new heights
1,@Everman @AndyKiersz I paid most of my Tesla-related expenses too. Tesla last year was actually net negative comp for me.
1,@dealer_of_happy @Tesla One day’s grace; taking into account time zone confusion. Will revert tomorrow.
1,@nichegamer Edgy move
1,@SPEXcast @WentaiW @1DarknessSoul5 @SpaceX Good idea
1,@WentaiW @1DarknessSoul5 @SpaceX True. I’m a gamer &amp; my boys are too. Starlink is designed to be great even for competitive twitch reflex games.
1,@fcain @varunversion1 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Would love to do exactly that
1,@Cosmic_Penguin Agreed; sent a note to Starlink team last week specifically regarding albedo reduction. We’ll get a better sense of value of this when satellites have raised orbits &amp; arrays are tracking to sun.
1,@fcain @varunversion1 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Exactly; potentially helping billions of economically disadvantaged people is the greater good. That said; we’ll make sure Starlink has no material effect on discoveries in astronomy. We care a great deal about science.
1,@John_Gardi @13ericralph31 @varunversion1 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Rotate on one axis. Magnetic torque rods for desaturation of momentum wheels.
1,@GoForStaging @13ericralph31 @varunversion1 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Yes; already planned. We avoid use of certain lower Ku frequencies specifically for radio astronomy.
1,@1DarknessSoul5 @SpaceX Aiming for sub 20ms latency initially; sub 10ms over time; with much greater consistency than terrestrial links; as only ever a few hops to major data centers
1,@13ericralph31 @varunversion1 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX If we need to tweak sat orientation to minimize solar reflection during critical astronomical experiments; that’s easily done. Most orbital objects are close to Earth btw; as shown by this NASA density map. https://t.co/83MwIZAEP6 https://t.co/NllMXregRg
1,@varunversion1 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX There are already 4900 satellites in orbit; which people notice ~0% of the time. Starlink won’t be seen by anyone unless looking very carefully &amp; will have ~0% impact on advancements in astronomy. We need to move telelscopes to orbit anyway. Atmospheric attenuation is terrible. https://t.co/OuWYfNmw0D
1,@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX No; Raptor uses a large number of coaxial swirl injectors; which (we believe) achieves highest theoretical mixing/combustion efficiency.
1,@meme0boi Fair
1,@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Super proud of SpaceX propulsion/test/materials team! One of hardest technology problems. New high temp superalloy &amp; internal foundry needed to make it work. Foundry iteration interval is ~3 weeks from design to flight part vs ~36 weeks typical for aerospace.
1,@DJSnM Only a tiny amount. There is enough air to affect the satellites &amp; allow some amount of yaw steering.
1,@SPEXcast @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Propellant stays same; but almost everything else improves. Fundamental goal is minimize cost per ton to surface of Mars.
1,@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Great video. Couple notes: Raptor designed for subcooled CH4/O2; so propellant density &amp; thrust increase up to ~8%; as needed for mission. 380 Isp &amp; up to 50% thrust/weight improvement over time. Merlin thrust/weight doubled from V1; but Raptor is closer to optimum.
1,@teslaownersSV @Tesla Whoa cool 😀
1,Beautiful solar sail
1,@mcjamez @_jameshatfield_ @danielcincu @Alex_Parker ISS is extremely gigantic &amp; has lights

1,Great ad
1,@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert This is complete nonsense
1,@Galaxygamerone Coming soon
1,@Tesmanian_com It will per vehicle
1,Old joke about agnostic technologists building artificial super intelligence to find out if there’s a God.  They finally finish &amp; ask the question.  AI replies: “There is now; mfs!!”
1,@BillyM2k Makes me sad
1,@GRDecter Combined with excess government spending; which forces other countries to absorb a significant part of our inflation
1,@GRDecter Serious issue. US policy has been too heavy-handed; making countries want to ditch the dollar.
1,@boringcompany Making progress!
1,@EvaFoxU 6 years ago
1,@iheartmindy This deserves close scrutiny 🧐
1,@BillyM2k AI optimizing for the greatest understanding of the universe might be the right objective. Eliminating or stunting human civilization would reduce understanding.
1,@Jason Yeah
1,@TwitterSafety Given that there are ~500 million tweets per day; making individual human review impossible; this is the most salient point.  One possible mitigation is a shorter suspension of 6 hours instead of 12.
1,@TheChiefNerd Leading AGI developers will not heed this warning; but at least it was said
1,@TeslaDiva99 Tesla car temp is automatically kept within a safe range; even when the car appears “off”; in order to protect infants &amp; pets.  That said; it would be more convenient to keep the car “on” for entertainment &amp; comfort if the camera detects occupants. We will make that change.
1,@george__mack I thought both SpaceX and Tesla each had less then a 10% chance of success
1,@alx Sick burn lol
1,Forgot to mention that accounts you follow directly will also be in For You; since you have explicitly asked for them
1,@PeterDiamandis I eat a donut every morning. Still alive.

1,That said; it’s ok to have verified bot accounts if they follow terms of service &amp; don’t impersonate a human
1,@Culture_Crit Walter Chrysler had great style
1,@WallStreetSilv Accurate
1,@ScottAtlas_IT Countries should make their own decisions!
1,@isabelleboemeke @TrungTPhan That jacket is 🔥🔥
1,@videotech_ My prediction is that this will be the only platform you can trust
1,@swyx Karma is real
1,@ShellenbergerMD @mtaibbi That’s very odd
1,@GAINNowAmerica Not having a massive short position against Tesla would be a step in the right direction!
1,@unusual_whales Phew; I can finally sleep at night
1,Starting April 15th; only verified accounts will be eligible to be in For You recommendations.  The is the only realistic way to address advanced AI bot swarms taking over. It is otherwise a hopeless losing battle.  Voting in polls will require verification for same reason.
1,@BillyM2k These are wild times for sure!
1,@rowancheung This one seems problematic https://t.co/ivIGmQHjDH
1,@PeterDiamandis Uh oh
1,@greggertruck Cybertruck will change the look of the roads. Finally feels like the future.
1,@heydave7 This is pure joy 🤩
1,@paulg Yeah
1,The good old days https://t.co/BohnyiRj32
1,@SamTwits @POTUS @CommunityNotes No; descriptions should be accurate. If only a small segment of the right or left is pushing something; then it wouldn’t be correct to paint all of the left or right with that viewpoint.
1,@ellagirwin @videotech_ Authenticator app is the way to go
1,@WholeMarsBlog Great video!
1,@PeterDiamandis Not so much in the banking sector rn

1,@WholeMarsBlog Still a few legacy NNs using single cam; single frame that need to move to surround video
1,@TD_Investor Or he could have just invested in Tesla at $200M market cap when he had the opportunity to do so
1,Given that modern AI can solve any “prove you’re not a robot” tests; it’s now trivial to spin up 100k human-like bots for less than a penny per account.  Paid verification increases bot cost by ~10;000% &amp; makes it much easier to identify bots by phone &amp; CC clustering.  Obvious
1,@StewMama71 @HansMahncke Exactly
1,It’s more about treating everyone equally. There shouldn’t be a different standard for celebrities imo.
1,@KobeissiLetter This is by far the most serious looming issue. Mortgages too.
1,@wanda_hudson It’s close. One more round of refinement needed.

1,@mezaoptimizer @sama For now
1,@Mrbankstips Absolutely
1,Big congratulations to the Tesla Germany team!!
1,@jasondebolt Try using a List
1,@TitterDaily Yeah; generally correct.   Titter was trending to lose ~$3B/year (revenue drop of ~$1.5B + debt servicing of ~$1.5B) and had $1B in cash; so only 4 months of money. Extremely dire situation.  Now that advertisers are returning; it looks like we will break even in Q2.
1,@GavinSBaker @hubermanlab I never take notes
1,@TeslaHype Indeed
1,@SawyerMerritt Looking forward to it
1,@WholeMarsBlog Competition has nothing to do with it. There are serious AI risk issues.
1,@stillgray Interesting take
1,@all_in_tok @DavidSacks Accurate
1,@iamharaldur Those are the right questions to ask. They have been troubling me for many years.  Neuralink was created as a possible long-term solution to human+AI symbiosis.

1,@GRDecter This is the real problem. Many cities have high office vacancy rates.  Mortgage portfolios are at risk too if housing prices drop significantly.
1,@nearcyan ChatGPT is entirely housed within Microsoft Azure. When push comes to shove; they have everything; including the model weights.
1,@hiromichimizuno Good question. It somehow transitioned from an open source non-profit to a closed source for-profit.

1,@BillyM2k @WatcherGuru A major driver of depositor flight is people moving money from low interest savings accounts to high interest money market (Treasury Bill) accounts.  This foolish rate hike will worsen depositor flight.

1,@andst7 Very concerning
1,@TwitterSafety This is a critical distinction. It’s obviously trivial for a single person to create 10k bot accounts on one computer; each of which is tweeting slurs that are written to avoid text string detection. What matters is whether those tweets are actually shown to real users.

1,@BillAckman @Twitter Good idea
1,@catturd2 Soros figured out a clever arbitrage opportunity:   The many small political contests; such as DAs &amp; judges; have much higher impact per dollar spent than the big races; so it is far easier to sway the outcome.
1,@POTUS @CommunityNotes I certainly agree that everyone should pay taxes and not engage in elaborate tax-avoidance schemes.   Would be curious to hear how these other “billionaires” are so good at avoiding taxes!  We should get rid of GRATs; but maybe other things too.
1,@BillyM2k @unusual_whales True
1,@itsjustcornbro Any true human can get verified. It’s only $7/month if bought annually via web (without App Store 30% premium).  Yes; non-advertising revenue sources are important; so that this platform is not overly reliant on the whims of corporate America; but having a large number of
1,@zerohedge This is a serious risk
1,In the coming weeks; Twitter will prioritize replies by:  1. People you follow 2. Verified accounts 3. Unverified accounts  Verified accounts are 1000X harder to game by bot &amp; troll armies.  There is great wisdom to the old saying: “You get what you pay for.”
1,@POTUS I paid 53% taxes on my Tesla stock options (40% Federal &amp; 13% state); so I must be lifting the average!  I also paid more income tax than anyone ever in the history of Earth for 2021 and will do that again in 2022.  @CommunityNotes; is the 3% number cited above accurate?

1,@danielhoughton @anothercohen @iamharaldur Based on your comment; I just did a videocall with Halli to figure out what’s real vs what I was told. It’s a long story.  Better to talk to people than communicate via tweet.

1,@SamTwits A crystal clear lesson that product &gt; marketing in the long run
1,@WallStreetSilv How blatantly obnoxious that they just want to keep canceling people! Do they ever write about music anymore?  They should rename themselves “Scolding Stone”; as all they seem to do these days is holier-than-thou nagging.

1,@getpaidwrite @boo I’d like to thank the advertising community that has stuck with us as we improve our ad products and experience.   We will deliver great results for you going forward.
1,@getpaidwrite @boo Same. Irrelevant/annoying ads work for neither the user nor the advertiser!
1,@ScottAdamsSays A big part of the problem is that journalists used to choose their career to pursue truth; but in recent years many have entered journalism to be activists
1,@alexchaomander Yes. Will be embarrassing.
1,@TalosIV_Pike @SirineAti @boo We started improving relevance in December; but still a very long way to go
1,@alex_avoigt Exactly
1,@BillyM2k @TheSmarmyBum Or at least it is indistinguishable from such. Either way.
1,@EvaFoxU Your tweets are excellent
1,@SirineAti @boo You are not alone. When I ask people if they use Twitter; almost all have for many years. When I ask if they’ve ever bought something from an ad after using the site for a decade; the answer is almost always no. That’s insane!  The biggest problem is that Twitter optimized for
1,@teslaownersSV @boo Never seen anything so messed up. Wish it wasn’t. But we’re making good progress; albeit with many 2 steps forward; 1 step back situations.
1,@boo My apologies; you must be a genius; which is why Twitter has the worst ad relevance on Earth.   Almost nobody buys anything on Twitter; but almost everyone on Instagram does.  That is being fixed.
1,This is my finest work – please add to gravestone along with “invented car fart” https://t.co/vbeOOqKuyT
1,@BillyM2k you are wise
1,@LouiseMensch @TheDustyBC True
1,@rawenclown @EvaFoxU Same
1,@BillyM2k The algorithm needs &amp; will get major upgrades. We will still publish it later this month; but please expect to see many bugs &amp; silly logic!  What matters is showing users compelling content. We’re doing better than before (I think). User-minutes are up &gt;10% from last year.
1,@TheDustyBC That’s been true for a long time &amp; is a function of an account’s popularity (Bieber was top recommendation).   I don’t think we should suggest anyone; but just show new users the most interesting tweets on system &amp; adjust according to what they like.
1,@greg16676935420 Nice
1,@Tedmund_ I was made the Tom of Twitter by Twitter!
1,@cb_doge Seriously! And I don’t even follow them.
1,Note: if many people who you follow or like also follow me; it is highly probable that the algorithm will recommend my tweets. It’s not super sophisticated.  In coming months; we will offer the ability to adjust the algorithm to closer match what is most compelling to you.
1,@jimmy_dore True
1,@washingtonpost Your article is false and obviously so. Do you really do no research at all? I mean; like reading a few tweets; for example.
1,@wongmjane Synchronization lag between our Portland and Atlanta data centers. Should be fixed now.
1,@Jim_Jordan This is a major crisis https://t.co/zHr69pRTVR
1,@AllanRicharz You might be right
1,What we need is TruthGPT
1,@TechTreesSDG @AgOregon_ That was an accurate ratio of those who actually wrote code to those who did not
1,@hugowiz Some of Twitter’s prior board members had never written a single Tweet!
1,Sorry for showing you so many irrelevant &amp; annoying ads on Twitter!   We’re taking the (obvious) corrective action of tying ads to keywords &amp; topics in tweets; like Google does with search.  This will improve contextual relevance dramatically.
1,@cb_doge True; but; on the plus side; their constant reporting about me on Twitter has driven usage to record levels 🤣
1,@thecryptojourno @platformer The “source” of the bogus Platformer article is a disgruntled employee who had been on paid time off for months; had already accepted a job at Google and felt the need to poison the well on the way out. Twitter will be taking legal action against him.
1,For example; despite having ~40M fewer followers back then; I have yet to come anywhere close to this gem https://t.co/bXVRqNQZhT
1,Several major media sources incorrectly reported that my Tweets were boosted above normal levels earlier this week.  A review of my Tweet likes &amp; views over the past 6 months; especially as a ratio of followers; shows this to be false.  We did have a bug that briefly caused
1,@GRDecter OpenAI was created as an open source (which is why I named it “Open” AI); non-profit company to serve as a counterweight to Google; but now it has become a closed source; maximum-profit company effectively controlled by Microsoft.  Not what I intended at all.

1,@billmaher Haha exactly! Also; I’m independent/moderate; not “conservative” or “liberal”. I’ve only voted Republican once and that was for a Mexican-American woman for Congress.
1,@skorusARK Definitely. The word “recall” for an over-the-air software update is anachronistic and just flat wrong!
1,@disclosetv “just like you” lol
1,@TitterTakeover @mashable @Twitter This is gonna be great
1,@BillyM2k @cb_doge Well I would hope that most San Franciscans agree with this principle

1,@stillgray @EvaFoxU Allowing users to make some of their Lists optionally public would be great
1,@Teslaconomics Minus gas tanks
1,@EvaFoxU @armrods It is still far too difficult to find out that Lists exist and then create them. UI modifications coming to make them easy to discover and offer great lists made by others (like Spötify playlists).

1,@Anna_Giaritelli Immigrants from China &amp; other Asian countries have made incredible contributions to America

1,@sreemoytalukdar Fixing the recommendation algorithm is our current top priority. Twitter engineering has been working super hard on this. Proud of the team.
1,Looking forward to Tesla Investor Day on March 1.   By this; we mean the broadest definition of investor; as in the people &amp; life of Earth.  It will be a message of good hope &amp; positivity for the future.
1,@cb_doge @daily_stardust Nice

1,@EvaFoxU @StationCDRKelly SpaceX commercial terminals; like other commercial products; are meant for private use; not military; but we have not exercised our right to turn them off.  We’re trying hard to do the right thing; where the “right thing” is an extremely difficult moral question.
1,@cb_doge Hopefully; one day we will be the aliens visiting other worlds
1,Starship orbital launch attempt soon! https://t.co/sjban6T4yA
1,@paulg Absolutely. Twitter is also a competitor to legacy media for news; so they are fundamentally conflicted.
1,@dogeofficialceo @StationCDRKelly Exactly
1,@StationCDRKelly You’re smart enough not to swallow media &amp; other propaganda bs.  Starlink is the communication backbone of Ukraine; especially at the front lines; where almost all other Internet connectivity has been destroyed.  But we will not enable escalation of conflict that may lead to WW3.
1,@farzyness Exactly. This will greatly increase public awareness that a Tesla can drive itself (supervised for now).
1,@DrEliDavid Seriously?
1,More work team completed over night:  - Removed height penalty affecting tweets with pics/video - increased # of recommended tweets - Better tracking of dropped tweets - Removed filter causing false negatives  - Removed penalty if user follows author - Improved reach of retweet
1,@MuskUniversity Maybe that’s what bacteria think as they encounter your water filter
1,Don’t worry; just some of my 👽 🛸 friends of mine stopping by …
1,@WholeMarsBlog Exactly
1,@chris_lamma That’s pretty much exactly what I look like when searching for snacks at 2am
1,@markusreimer v11.3 (single stack) goes to limited beta this week. Probably 11.3.2 before wide release in North America.  Then we adapt for EU roads &amp; submit to regulators. 90% of what we’ve done so far for NA applies WW.
1,@BillyM2k The giant block lists are problematic. They mess up the recommendation system &amp; create a DDoS vector.
1,@TitterTakeover We will transition to using only paid Blue Verified for signals; as otherwise too vulnerable to bot/troll manipulation
1,@MarcusHouse Anecdotally; it wasn’t as loud as expected
1,@cb_doge Yes. Advertising also needs to be semantic keyword-based; so it’s contextually relevant. Amazingly; ads shown when doing twitter searches don’t consider the search words! We’re changing that as fast as possible.
1,[Oversized font &amp; undersized paragraph spacing will be fixed this week]
1,Long day at Twitter HQ with eng team  Two significant problems mostly addressed:  1. Fanout service for Following feed was getting overloaded when I tweeted; resulting in up to 95% of my tweets not getting delivered at all. Following is now pulling from search (aka Earlybird).
1,@BuckSexton Well-said
1,@ClownWorld_ True
1,@stats_feed Certainly feels that way
1,Starship Super Heavy https://t.co/DgufvqgWCC
1,@disclosetv Extremely concerning
1,@MuskUniversity This is the fundamental reason why Tesla was the first new American car company to reach sustained positive cash flow since Chrysler ~100 years ago.  The product has to be compelling enough to overcome a fundamental cost disadvantage.
1,@WholeMarsBlog Exactly
1,@teslaownersSV Great Tesla Solar Roof install!
1,@RuaneFootball Periscope does partly live on with Spaces; but no question that we need to bring back an even better version of vine

1,@WholeMarsBlog Yeah; the format is terrible. Update early next week.
1,@CatherinScience I must admit to being congenitally optimistic (SpaceX &amp; Tesla wouldn’t exist otherwise); but I think 5 years is possible and 10 years is highly likely

1,@venturetwins I am DAN!
1,Going forward; Twitter will be broadly accepting of different values; rather than trying to impose its own specific values on the world
1,@MattMackowiak @Twitter @DavidSacks This is being fixed. Policy against showing blood in profile pic is being amended to “clearly showing blood without clicking on the profile pic”.  The intent is to avoid people being forced to see gruesome profile pics.

1,@WSJ Last 3 months were extremely tough; as had to save Twitter from bankruptcy; while fulfilling essential Tesla &amp; SpaceX duties. Wouldn’t wish that pain on anyone.  Twitter still has challenges; but is now trending to breakeven if we keep at it. Public support is much appreciated!
1,@ScottAdamsSays Documentaries are dangerous in this way. That said; MJ clearly had major issues. No documentary needed for that.
1,@PepitoTheCat @BillyM2k @ericnakagawa Responding to feedback; Twitter will enable a light; write-only API for bots providing good content that is free
1,@teslaownersSV Production will have red light bar
1,@FonsDK @SpaceX Probably more
1,@teslaownersSV V11 has been tougher than expected; as  it is a significant rearchitecture of NNs; plus many more NNs replacing C++. Hoping to ship v11.3 end of week.
1,@Teslaconomics Very hard car to build; as it is unlike any other; but; as stated publicly; Cybertruck production starts this year

1,@PepitoTheCat @BillyM2k @ericnakagawa I guess we could give all Verified users access to the API for posts like this
1,@WholeMarsBlog Sucks that I had to sell so much Tesla stock to do so (sigh)
1,@WholeMarsBlog Me neither
1,@DriveTeslaca Yeah. Still many small tweaks to make it better (and the side mirrors are removable by owner); but this is very close to production design.
1,@BillyM2k @ericnakagawa Yuh; that is par for the course
1,@TitterTakeover Super appreciate support of @NFL &amp; major advertisers &amp; congrats to Twitter team!
1,@TitterTakeover @Twitter Progress!
1,@BillyM2k @ericnakagawa Yeah; free API is being abused badly right now by bot scammers &amp; opinion manipulators. There’s no verification process or cost; so easy to spin up 100k bots to do bad things.  Just ~$100/month for API access with ID verification will clean things up greatly.
1,Congrats Falcon &amp; Starlink teams!
1,@BillyM2k Reply threads are the modern forum for debates
1,@BillyM2k True
1,In turbulent economic times; be wary of using margin loans to buy stock
1,@AwakenWithJP Very effective
1,@Rainmaker1973 Humanity takes up very little of Earth’s surface area – you can fit the entire population of Earth in New York City on one floor (@waitbutwhy)  https://t.co/jdzbQsSWzd
1,@TrungTPhan It’s coming
1,This helped identify some issues with the system. Should be addressed by next week.
1,@monitoringbias Interesting
1,@LeighWolf It is a serious concern
1,@nichegamer Something fundamental is wrong
1,@98CRuE6 @ShellenbergerMD True
1,@ShellenbergerMD Accurate
1,@OwenGregorian @ScottAdamsSays All things considered; this is the better approach imo
1,Made my account private until tomorrow morning to test whether you see my private tweets more than my public ones
1,@BillyM2k We’re also reviewing ad rev share for ads in a creator’s tweet replies – create an interesting thread and get paid for it!
1,@cb_doge @mayemusk @Tesla I was just reviewing the production beta Cybertruck. It is incredible.
1,@libsoftiktok Something is wrong
1,@BillyM2k You’re welcome. Axed them yesterday to focus on enabling writers to add essays as attachments to tweets.  Combined with improvements to creator subscriptions (fka superfollow); you will be able to publish directly on Twitter &amp; get paid for it.  Beta version launching next week.
1,@WallStreetSilv Wise words
1,@MrAndyNgo @pwsyme Business Insider is not a real publication
1,@RepDanBishop @ShellenbergerMD No one is above the Constitution
1,@TheBabylonBee Accurate https://t.co/xflwJJqQSd
1,@ElijahSchaffer It expresses this view without a shred of doubt; which is discordant with the scientific method
1,@stillgray Wow; this is extremely concerning
1,@BillyM2k @Gerashchenko_en SpaceX Starlink has become the connectivity backbone of Ukraine all the way up to the front lines. This is the damned if you do part.   However; we are not allowing Starlink to be used for long-range drone strikes. This is the damned if you don’t part.
1,@Gerashchenko_en Damned if you do; damned if you don’t
1,@JonErlichman True
1,@TaraBull808 Yeah; it’s bizarre!
1,Another batch of Starlinks in orbit. These will mostly support high latitude connectivity.
1,@stillgray @Lukewearechange They are behind the times
1,Hydro; nuclear fission &amp; geothermal will also be significant parts of the solution
1,@Lukewearechange Accurate
1,@ZaleskiLuke You are an expert in propaganda 😂
1,Wind &amp; solar; combined with batteries; will solve sustainable energy for Earth
1,@Erdayastronaut @flightclubio Expendable upper stage may or may not fly; but it is an option
1,@TheChiefNerd Once again; parody &amp; reality are indistinguishable 😂
1,@TaraBull808 The war is escalating quickly
1,@JeffBezos @Nick_Offerman Great game; great show
1,Over time; we expect Giga Nevada to be almost entirely solar-powered
1,It’s already the biggest battery cell; pack &amp; electric motor factory in Americas
1,What the Tesla Giga Nevada factory will look like when finished. https://t.co/0O5U8jRerQ
1,Good meeting with @ThierryBreton regarding EU DSA. The goals of transparency; accountability &amp; accuracy of information are aligned with ours.  @CommunityNotes will be transformational for the latter.
1,@dictionaryhill Makes my eyes hurt to look at it
1,@dividendgrowth1 @JonErlichman Why margin loans should be avoided in turbulent macroeconomic conditions
1,@BillyM2k @MuskUniversity It’s weird when they use the exact same words almost simultaneously
1,@BillyM2k @DavidSacks Turns out that hell is just twitter lol
1,@BBCScienceNews Most ironic thing I’ve read in a while. How much wood could a woodcock …
1,@TrungTPhan Yikes
1,@BillyM2k @DavidSacks Here we are in the afterlife
1,@teslaownersSV Exactly
1,Just leaving the engine bay of Starship https://t.co/JTnFfNaymh
1,@MrAndyNgo @pwsyme I don’t know this person at all; but explicit threats of violence obviously violate Twitter ToS
1,@TeslaHype Less than Chuck Norris though
1,@MuskUniversity Does seem odd
1,@NoTSarno @unusual_whales A little
1,@WR4NYGov Looks like Tesla is doing ok
1,@DavidSacks Exactly
1,@BillyM2k Chuck Norris could recover all the funds from FTX
1,@FonsDK Absolutely
1,@OPhommachanh Somehow; the sign sorta works
1,@itsALLrisky Well-said
1,@DavidSacks The lesson of history is that countries do not heed the lesson of history

1,Resist the current
1,Disingenuous response from Hamilton 68 regarding their fake claims of Russian interference
1,@EvaFoxU The brothers were very grim indeed!
1,@BillyM2k wise words
1,@JonErlichman Oddly reassuring
1,@dockaurG Government overreach
1,@mhauken Useful
1,@ChrisJBakke I could *really* use those features
1,@mysteriouskat Good feature list
1,@MaidQuitNoChef @JennaEllisEsq @atensnut @TwitterSupport Am hearing this from many people. Will investigate.
1,@unusual_whales I’m sure everything will be fine
1,@JarennC @WWE @LoganPaul @KingRicochet It’s only a matter of time 😂
1,@BBrownCFCVT @IamTheImmortal Next app update will make For You or Following choice persist.  Agreed that recommended tweets should be more chronologically ordered. They cannot be entirely so.
1,@teslaownersSV “and he’s building a giant rocket to get back to his home planet!”
1,@SRuhle This is the Tweet for which was condemned (and which I deleted within hours of posting) https://t.co/ldPwaKPEpH
1,@IamTheImmortal Working on it
1,@EvaFoxU @SRuhle That is rather rare
1,@mikeduncan @AmesCG How exactly is it breaking down? You’re literally using it right now.  And why are you objecting to hearing from people with views that differ from yours? That is at odds with what you espouse in your (excellent) podcast.
1,@SRuhle I did
1,@mikeduncan That’s incorrect. You’re only half the product; as you get half the ads.  We will offer a no ads subscription soon.
1,@DavidSacks Exactly
1,@lhfang @DavidSacks This is the biggest journalism scam in a very long time
1,@SawyerMerritt @Tesla @GoodFaithEnergy They did a great job!
1,@GoodFaithEnergy Congrats on a beautiful Tesla Solar Roof installation!
1,@teslaownersSV You’re welcome.   Note: apparent engagement on Twitter will seem lower; as bots would like/follow/retweet much more than people; but now you know it’s real.
1,Another major improvement in timeline refresh speed just released – now 10X faster than a few months ago
1,@atensnut Nonetheless; I apologize
1,@DrAnitaBEtin Had me there for a minute
1,@MotherJones @mtaibbi Good for you. Taibbi has the emails &amp; docs.
1,I work all day; then go home &amp; play work simulator
1,@Rainmaker1973 And hunt your enemies
1,@jgebbia They should keep them operating!
1,@farzyness No way
1,@mtaibbi Please correct your bs @PolitiFact &amp; @snopes
1,@WallStreetSilv A quarter of all taxes just to pay the interest on the debt
1,@nudubabba @mikeduncan Yeah; whole thing
1,@TaraBull808 That’s way more monkeys than the movie!
1,@mikeduncan You should see what I get
1,Nothing conveys gravitas better than being called Mr. Tweet 🐥
1,So then why do call yourself “The” Associated Press 😂 https://t.co/DPdQYjXfdO
1,@TheRabbitHole84 Oh the irony 🤣
1,@mtaibbi @MotherJones Well; @MotherJones; are you going to retract your fake stories or simply hope that people forget about them?
1,@mikeduncan Do you care about the truth or what is “left” or “right”? What matters more to you?
1,@mtaibbi @maddow She is blinded by hatred
1,@stevenmarkryan @teslaownersSV @RiskReversal Haha 💯. This doofus actually believes what the media writes about me.
1,@andst7 Italy &amp; many other nations are dying 😔
1,An American group made false claims about Russian election interference to interfere with American elections
1,@GuyDealership Every time Fed raises rates; they’re increasing monthly payments for anything bought with debt
1,@SawyerMerritt True
1,@mtaibbi @nytimes @washingtonpost @CNNnewsroom @NBCNews @MotherJones They should. Let’s see which ones actually come clean.
1,@mtaibbi What’s going on here @SecureDemocracy?
1,Shame on @MSNBC for misleading the public!
1,@jim_desmond Sure @boringcompany
1,@hausfath @guardian Som ace reporting there … only off by a factor of literally 1000X
1,@AukeHoekstra @guardian The Guardian is broken. Can someone please fix it?
1,Twitter is the PvP of social media
1,@McDonalds Oh hi lol
1,@SouthPark @CasaBonita New Casa Bonita will be 🔥🔥
1,@bullboy66 @SenSchumer Good idea!
1,Just met with @SpeakerMcCarthy &amp; @RepJeffries to discuss ensuring that this platform is fair to both parties
1,@EvaFoxU @Lukewearechange Noted; but there do seem to be some genuine govt corruption issues.  The fundamental question remains: what is the realistic path to peace? There doesn’t seem to be one.
1,@StonksReddit My Twitter home page https://t.co/WFb0T1n87D
1,@EvaFoxU Absolutely
1,@ScottAdamsSays @IamLewisU The people
1,@cb_doge I hope that preserving &amp; extending the light of consciousness is a goal that all of humanity can support
1,@EvaFoxU @Lukewearechange Nobody is in favor of the Russian invasion; but how does this end with the least amount of bloodshed?
1,@ACLU Kudos to ACLU for this non-partisan support of free speech!
1,@TheBabylonBee Only a matter of time!
1,@BillyM2k Kangaroos love kickboxing!
1,@mtaibbi De facto attack on First Amendment
1,@ScottAdamsSays Please run. That would be awesome.
1,@RubinReport Accurate thread
1,@SenSchumer May I suggest a DM chat 🙏 https://t.co/wmwBxEFit1
1,@cb_doge @Tesla @mayemusk And then was at Twitter HQ past midnight. Very long day.
1,@dogeofficialceo Will dig in
1,Congrats Tesla California factory team on all-time record production! https://t.co/1aF53hgWgM
1,@EvaFoxU Tweetception
1,@SenSchumer @RepJeffries Do you write your own tweets? I recommend it.
1,Changed my name to Mr. Tweet; now Twitter won’t let me change it back 🤣
1,@BLKMDL3 Same; Mexico rocks! 🇲🇽
1,@ScottAdamsSays Yes; but this was not disclosed to the public for a long time after the government and vaccine makers knew. Not cool.  That said; obviously if someone is coughing less; there is some reduction in transmission.
1,Starship fully loaded with cryogenic propellant https://t.co/GbyEshomft
1,@WholeMarsBlog Lmaooo
1,@thevivafrei First I’ve heard. It is not possible for me to fix every aspect of Twitter worldwide overnight; while still running Tesla and SpaceX; among other things.
1,@tim_zaman @sedielem Gaming rocks
1,@JoeyFromPhilly Will do a thorough review over the next week
1,@BillyM2k @dogeofficialceo Yeah. The corpo media shills clearly have their marching orders to write hit pieces on me these days; but the articles are painfully boring.  Reading them is like getting a tranquilizer dart in the jugular.
1,@dogeofficialceo Thank you; Sir Doge!
1,@BretWeinstein Several aspects of For You recommendations were fixed last night. Team and were in the office past midnight.  You should see improvements; but we are continuing to monitor.
1,@Timcast He is also the heart of the show
1,@BretWeinstein Are you still seeing this issue today?
1,1/2 a 🐝 philosophically must ipso facto  1/2 not 🐝
1,🐝 all u can🐝
1,@Rainmaker1973 Hop in; we’re going to Mars!
1,@BillyM2k I think everyone is awesome
1,@BretWeinstein Will investigate
1,@MarioNawfal South Korea has an even lower birth rate
1,@JudiciaryGOP @SpeakerMcCarthy This is important
1,@slashdot Population collapse is a major risk to the future of civilization  https://t.co/ZI8QRt2Ev4
1,@thomasmidleton @VivekGRamaswamy Far too much power is concentrated in the hands of “shareholder services” companies like ISS and Glass Lewis; because so much of the market is passive/index funds; which outsource shareholder voting decisions to them.  ISS and Glass Lewis effectively control the stock market.
1,@alx That turned out to be um … inaccurate
1,@JonErlichman Good thread
1,@billysteeler85 @NicoleBehnam That too
1,@NicoleBehnam I don’t like the taste or effects of most alcohol; but there is something quite beautiful about red wine in a fine glass
1,@MarioNawfal It can summarized with one emoji: 😴
1,@WholeMarsBlog Maybe one day
1,@SmokeAwayyy Big year for AI
1,@MuskUniversity Major respect for the makers
1,@WallStreetSilv @SRSroccoReport No change in copper production is required for the transition to sustainable energy.   Lithium refinement needs to increase dramatically; but lithium ore itself is extremely common throughout Earth.
1,@mtaibbi Another case of parody &amp; reality being indistinguishable
1,@cb_doge @Tesla @mayemusk Wow; lot has happened in 13 years
1,@BillyM2k yeah
1,@cb_doge Busted
1,@BillyM2k One of my favorite features
1,@WholeMarsBlog Probably a good idea
1,@BillFOXLA @FoxNews Where have they *not* found classified documents? That might be a shorter list.
1,@DrNickA True
1,@WallStreetSilv @CommunityNotes We are going to great lengths to avoid the Wikipedia left wing editorial control problem. By the same token; Community Notes cannot be biased towards the right either. Maximizing for truth is the goal.
1,@JonErlichman Always liked that design
1,@ahmadtariq07 @Fidias0 True
1,@WallStreetSilv @dogeofficialceo @TheRabbitHole84 @WholeMarsBlog @BillyM2k lmao
1,@tyromper Yeah; we’re thinking hard about this
1,@PeterDiamandis Absolutely. Freedom means freedom to die when you are sure that you want to.
1,@TheRabbitHole84 Notes must stay pure.
1,@giano That’s the plan!
1,@TheRabbitHole84 Maybe there’s a way to do this by placing an ad below tweet details
1,Also; there will be a higher priced subscription that allows zero ads
1,Ads are too frequent on Twitter and too big. Taking steps to address both in coming weeks.
1,@CollinRugg That is a little delayed; as a key researcher can only travel to Twitter in early Feb
1,@OzraeliAvi Twitter is the source of truth
1,@DexterWWinters @ScottAdamsSays Was required to visit Tesla Giga Berlin. Not my choice.
1,@unusual_whales The note is incorrect. There are ~2300 active; working employees at Twitter.  There are still hundreds of employees working on trust &amp; safety; along with several thousand contractors.   Less than 10 people from my other companies are working at Twitter.
1,@peters8620 @stillgray @ScottAdamsSays I had OG C19 before vaccines came out and it was basically a mild cold.  Then had J&amp;J vaccine with no bad effects; except my arm hurt briefly.  First mRNA booster was ok; but the second one crushed me.
1,@ScottAdamsSays And my cousin; who is young &amp; in peak health; had a serious case of myocarditis. Had to go to the hospital.
1,@ScottAdamsSays I had major side effects from my second booster shot. Felt like I was dying for several days. Hopefully; no permanent damage; but I dunno.
1,@CommunityNotes Extremely important
1,@BillyM2k @joshzepps Sigh … I hope Sam becomes his old super rational self again one day
1,@slashdot Cool
1,@LayahHeilpern Interesting &amp; entertaining content from around the world is worth seeing
1,@WorldAndScience 🤣 yeah
1,@lexfridman Two of the worst possible curses: - You will live forever - You can have anything you want
1,@WholeMarsBlog Cool
1,@TheRightMelissa Back then; George Washington was the “old guy” at age 44!
1,@EvaFoxU @BillyM2k Japan has higher total user-minutes than the USA; so Japan is actually #1
1,@teslaownersSV I’m reviewing it next week for possible release
1,@TimRunsHisMouth Good question
1,(Tweets will be translated before being recommended)
1,@vastblastx Coming feature
1,There are epic tweets in other countries every day (Japan especially)
1,Next Twitter update will remember whether you were on For You (ie recommended); Following or list you made &amp; stop switching you back to recommended tweets
1,@cb_doge @APompliano The debt trend is 🤯🤯
1,@APompliano More than triple that when you add social security; Medicare &amp; govt pension obligations
1,@TaraBull808 Or spending too much time on social media
1,In coming months; Twitter will translate &amp; recommend amazing tweets from people in other countries &amp; cultures
1,Exactly! If companies post interesting or entertaining content; they will gain an audience rapidly.
1,@DavidSacks I am super pro Ukraine; but relentless escalation is very risky for Ukraine and the world
1,@ezralevant Power to the people!
1,@teslaownersSV 99% of people still have no idea how profound this is
1,@WallStreetSilv Macron is doing the difficult; but right thing. The retirement age of 62 was set when lifespans were much shorter. It is impossible for a small number of workers to support a massive number of retirees.
1,@BillyM2k @unusual_whales It is actually not true. Employee headcount is almost double that.
1,@BillyM2k @christinebarnum What are you playing?
1,@EvaFoxU Cool :)
1,@TheRabbitHole84 Yes; that will be added in an upcoming release. Also; if your tweet is bookmarked; it will be treated as a “quiet like” and increment your likes counter.
1,Major Twitter improvement we just released is that you can now bookmark tweets from tweet details page.  Importantly; bookmarks are *private*; unlike likes. No one other than you can see your bookmarks.
1,Twitter app update now available on App Store
1,@EvaFoxU True
1,@TitterTakeover Onboarding should have fewer steps; not more; but creating pinned lists should automatically be offered if you swipe past Following.   Also; we need to offer suggested lists by category; so you can use awesome subject matter lists created by others.
1,Use pinned Lists to improve your Twitter experience!  1. Tap Lists on your profile page. 2. Create list of accounts to follow. 3. Tap pin icon.   This allows you to swipe left/right between For You; Following and Lists.
1,@SawyerMerritt @Tesla Teslas are the safest cars on the road; but most people don’t know that
1,@morganisawizard Bolitho also fought in the Battle of the Somme. He was buried alive in a pile of bodies with a broken neck.
1,@WallStreetSilv Concerning
1,@catturd2 @amuse @Twitter This is bizarre. Looking into it.
1,@paulg Exactly
1,@engineers_feed Ok; maybe a little pontificating
1,@cb_doge App update has been approved by Apple. Should go out in next day or so.
1,@mualphaxi The pendulum has swung a bit too far
1,@WallStreetSilv Even if you tax every billionaire in America at 100%; it barely makes a dent in the national debt. In the end; the government will be forced to tax everyone to pay the debt.  Btw; $31T doesn’t include unfunded liabilities; which are *much* higher.
1,@cb_doge @ElijahSchaffer If bots are removed from the system; their likes will be removed too. Are you seeing likes from clearly human accounts disappear?
1,@ElijahSchaffer Are you still finding engagement to be low?
1,@teslaownersSV The kind words are appreciated
1,@micsolana @teslaownersSV @SjvTesla One of the bot defenses we implemented was flagging any account responding to tweets faster than humanly possible
1,@stillgray Good question to ask him
1,@teslaownersSV @SjvTesla It is very difficult to stop bots &amp; trolls; while not affecting real users. Won’t be perfect either way; but Twitter is far more resilient to fake accounts than it ever has been.
1,Twitter is arguably already the least wrong source of truth on the Internet; but we obviously still have a long way to go.  Enabling @CommunityNotes to operate at very large scale and providing maximum transparency about how Twitter works are fundamental to building trust.
1,Coming soon are notifications if you’ve replied; liked or retweeted something subsequently corrected by community
1,@ShellenbergerMD @mgurri The peer-enforced sameness of thought in most of the media is troubling
1,@Js_Makali @financialjuice No; I am wrong too often
1,@SenSchumer Trimming some government expenditures would be wise https://t.co/1EwWyqetir
1,@financialjuice Peak oil demand probably happens within the next 5 years
1,@financialjuice True; there will be a long tail of usage; but it will peak long before then
1,@Lukewearechange Ahem …
1,@AlecStapp Seriously! It is super important to keep ace players in the United States. Forcing them to work for other countries is so crazy.
1,@teslaownersSV @Tesla @Ford @Rivian @LucidMotors Fed rate increases make cars more expensive for consumers; increasing the difficulty level for automotive companies
1,@ggreenwald True

1,@paulg People can disguise their own morality; but not that of their friends. Birds of a feather …
1,Great work by Tesla Team!
1,To be clear; I’m not someone who thinks lots of government agencies should be abolished (maybe a few); but we should always question our institutions; as this strengthens the bedrock of democracy.
1,Why did American media go from questioning the State and “speaking truth to power” to doing their bidding?
1,@alx Will be interesting to see how the Biden administration reacts to this.   They may try to weaponize Federal agencies against Twitter.
1,The World Economic Forum should control the world
1,@disclosetv WEF is increasingly becoming an unelected world government that the people never asked for and don’t want
1,@ggreenwald @megynkelly Very true
1,Media want to control what you know; which is why citizen journalism is essential
1,@ElijahSchaffer An update to the For You algorithm included too many tweets from people users didn’t follow. That change has been reverted.
1,@TaraBull808 Brief synchronization lag between our Atlanta &amp; Portland data centers
1,@physorg_com @USC @PNASNews Maybe because it’s online &amp; social …  How is it possible that copycat propaganda is published simultaneously on so many legacy media channels?   That is the question you should be asking.
1,@EWoodhouse7 Interesting
1,@glennbeck @ShellenbergerMD Citizen journalism is vital to the future of civilization
1,The party is on!! 🚀 💫 ♥️ https://t.co/zoa3qmcXqC

1,@karpathy Great thread
1,@TikTokInvestors Are these real? This video implies people physically show up to work.
1,Companies in general are missing the incredible opportunity that Twitter provides to reach customers.   Just Tweet interesting things! That’s all it takes.

1,@RepTroyNehls Does seem odd
1,@bgurley Wise words
1,@Davos Population collapse is an existential problem for humanity; not overpopulation!
1,@foxmediallc @paulg Twitter Verified tweets are more likely to be recommended to others; as they are less likely to be bots or troll farms
1,@katewand @DrEliDavid @canuck741 Sounds accurate
1,@BBCBreaking Government data has far more latency &amp; error than people think; which is why it’s so frequently restated; especially in a rapidly changing economy.  When the economy is not changing rapidly; actually measuring things isn’t important; as you can simply extrapolate from the past.
1,@ImMeme0 Is it even possible to parody their tweets? I’m just literally wondering right now if it’s even possible 🤔
1,@paulg Looking at the comments; this social network might be trending positively towards positivity. We will try to make that more the case.
1,@weirdterrifying Nice
1,@KanekoaTheGreat Interesting thread
1,@JaneidyEve The recommendation algorithm will get much better and it will be open source
1,@ScottAdamsSays “Master the Future” doesn’t sound ominous at all … 🙄  How is WEF/Davos even a thing? Are they trying to be the boss of Earth!?
1,Trashing accounts that you hate will cause our algorithm to show you more of those accounts; as it is keying off of your interactions.  Basically saying if you love trashing *that* account; then you will probably also love trashing *this* account. Not actually wrong lol.
1,@BillyM2k Should Twitter keep it active?
1,@jacobin This is a rare case where I agree with Jacobin.  Increasing quality of life for the aged is important; but increased lifespan; especially if cognitive impairment is not addressed; is not good for civilization.  We are already ruled by a gerontocracy!
1,@banthebbc BBC is at least honest that they are the *British* Broadcasting Corporation; unlike many others …
1,@banthebbc Well; your account handle is literally BanTheBBC haha!  But that’s actually the point I was making: state influence/affiliation with media is far more common than most people realize – just look at how much Twitter/FB/Google have been influenced!
1,@Brookstone23 @realchrisrufo @wef There are some really funny WEF parody accounts; although it’s legit hard to tell WEF truth from WEF parody sometimes!
1,@realchrisrufo Sensible thread.   We shouldn’t be obsessed with WEF/Davos; but they take themselves sooo seriously that making fun of them is awesome 😎
1,@Jason Population collapse is a massive danger to the future of civilization!

1,@DJSnM @ThePrimalDino Center core moving too fast return. Falcon Heavy is a 3 (or 2.5) stage rocket; but full &amp; rapid reusability on Earth demand a 2 stage rocket.  1st stage returns to launch site immediately via boostback &amp; 2nd stage orbits until ground track passes back over launch site to return.
1,@appuntito160 People on the right should see more “left wing” stuff and people on the left should see more “right wing” stuff.  But you can just block it if you want to stay in an echo chamber.
1,@DavidSacks The censorship tools were created to deal with scams &amp; spam; but then were turned to political purposes.  Those who favor censorship should remember that it is only a matter of time before censorship turns on you.  There will always be some censorship; but less is better.
1,@stats_feed Exactly. Money is actually a set of heterogeneous databases with vast amounts of legacy code still using COBOL on mainframes in batch mode.
1,@DavidSacks @zerohedge Zerohedge can be jerks at times; but they did nothing warranting suspension
1,@stats_feed Sea water contains enough of every element to support &gt;10X current civilizational needs
1,@ShellenbergerMD @wef @Davos There should be a game show: “4Chan or Davos; who said it?”

1,Instagram makes people depressed &amp; Twitter makes people angry. Which is better?
1,@teslaownersSV @Teslarati @JohnnaCrider1 Many small things. We’re starting to make use of neural nets for vehicle navigation &amp; control; not just vision.
1,@teslaownersSV @Teslarati @JohnnaCrider1 About five full stacks
1,@teslaownersSV @Teslarati @JohnnaCrider1 Should start rolling out later this week; next week at the latest

1,@ggreenwald This is extremely concerning
1,@jxeral Ironically; the company that made the first commercially viable internal combustion engine car saved the company that made the first commercially viable electric car!
1,@jxeral True; the Daimler investment in 2009 is actually what saved Tesla
1,@HistoryBoomer That’s what she said
1,I wonder what would have happened in 2009 if the Fed had raised rates instead of lowering them 🤔 https://t.co/uDGUqg4GKq
1,@ScottAdamsSays Easier to argue that global warming is a risk (rather than a certainty); but it is foolish to roll those dice; given that we will eventually run out of fossil fuels and have to generate energy sustainably anyway.
1,@skorusARK There will probably be far more robots than humans in the future
1,@WaltDisneyWorld This looks cool!
1,@ggreenwald Please post what you received on Twitter
1,Twitter will publish tweet recommendation code &amp; make account/tweet status visible no later than next month.  Transparency builds trust.

1,Starship launch attempt soon https://t.co/QBprVsAH7m
1,@LucasFoxNews No kidding …
1,@Snowden Most people have no idea that Reality Winner is a real person. Fate 🖤 irony.
1,@TheRabbitHole84 @WallStreetSilv Maybe we should spend less time on social media … ?
1,@Tesmanian_com Starlink in aircraft feels the same as a high speed connection on the ground
1,@WallStreetSilv Demolition Man movie is becoming real
1,@WillManidis This a major problem. Adderall is just low-grade speed &amp; greatly amplifies your inner a**hole!
1,@DrJBhattacharya This problem is extremely prevalent in academia
1,@EvaFoxU Please be cautious about writing articles citing “unnamed sources”; as they are frequently false
1,@SawyerMerritt @Tesla Great work by Tesla Team!
1,Some things that your party tells you are false and some things that the other party says are true
1,@slashdot This seems extortionately high. It also isn’t clear whether; all things considered; a second booster helps or hurts.
1,@stillgray Good question
1,@cb_doge Yes; I don’t like it either.
1,All four orbital launch pads fully loaded with rockets for the first time!
1,@mtaibbi Exactly
1,@TrungTPhan That is dedication
1,@BillyM2k We will strive to increase the joy of Twitter!
1,@ggreenwald Tragic
1,@paulg New UI coming this week allowing easy switch between recommended &amp; followed. Recommendations will get much better later this year.

1,@IMAO_ @neontaster Agreed
1,@neontaster We will also be adding simple formatting features like bold; underline &amp; font size later this quarter.   The goal is to allow people to publish long-form natively on Twitter; rather than forcing them to use another website.  Twitter will continue to recommend brevity in tweets.
1,@neontaster Yes; these will get the same Timeline screen space as other tweets; but you will be able to click for more

1,This was so funny 🤣🤣
1,@ajtourville I’ve always loved video games
1,California needs comprehensive reform
1,A major factor for why Ukraine was NOT overrun by Russia is the Starlink support I provided; at great risk to @SpaceX cyber &amp; physical attack by Russian military forces.   Starlink is the BACKBONE of Ukrainian military communications at the front lines; because everything else
1,@cb_doge I have no problem being called gay tbh
1,@sherkhantx @Teslaconomics @Tesla 💯 great idea!
1,@nima_owji It’s called Highlights; but we should make that the default landing spot

1,Hugh Hewitt is right: there was election interference by the Democrats in Bucks County that was so serious that a judge ordered early voting to be extended several more days!
1,Vote in person in Bucks County!  Only 5 hours left.
1,Vote for @realDonaldTrump if you want humanity to make it to Mars!
1,@ajtourville @Boeing There is no logical purpose to Starliner; given that NASA plans to deorbit Space Station in ~5 years
1,@TheRabbitHole84 @SkepResCenter That is how the educational system programmed them to think
1,@shaunmmaguire We should definitely increase nuclear power. No-brainer.
1,@ajtourville They will just ban this platform and anything else that allows true freedom of speech

1,@ajtourville @Tesla It was an interesting conversation.   Combustion rockets are the best way to get to Mars in the short to medium term.

1,@alx @realDonaldTrump He went klepto and stole her glasses
1,@alx @realDonaldTrump He really does
1,@TheRabbitHole84 That said; the Republican vote is still ~558k better than 2020; when Biden only won by ~80k; so it is still strongly trending towards a @realDonaldTrump victory
1,@TheRabbitHole84 There was a sudden jump in R vs D early votes in Pennsylvania.   The last 9 days are roughly: -9k; -9k; -7k;-2k; -5k;-1k; 0;+1k;-8k  So the curve went from steadily trending towards Republican to suddenly heavy Democrat.   Very odd. https://t.co/LOgv1cqkrq

1,@iamyesyouareno Is the @ADL still pushing this too?

1,@redmor11 @PlugInFUD @JoelSapp @rrosenbl @Tesla NVIDIA is a great company; but we needed (essentially) a dedicated ASIC for vision-based driving; whereas their solution needs to serve many different customer needs.
1,@AttorneyFrey @MarcusLauer3 @Tesla @Teslarati I think it will be something like that. Much more productive to manage a fleet of robotaxis than only drive one taxi yourself.
1,@martinengwicht @JoelSapp @rrosenbl @Tesla 21 TOPS for Xavier. Pegasus is just Xavier with a power hog GPU on a separate board. Problem is you can’t transfer data fast enough between computer &amp; GPU; so GPU usable TOPS is almost irrelevant.
1,@JoelSapp @rrosenbl @Tesla Exactly; Tesla &amp; Nvidia numbers described by Pete were max *usable* teraops running our vision net
1,@GamingSpeedy We’re working on it. Takes time to get all regulatory approvals. Almost there for the larger US states. At least 6 to 12 months for Europe/UK.

1,@s3xynews @patfan198010 Agreed; we’re ramping up service centers &amp; Tesla mobile service worldwide
1,@Mike_Mitrakos More like $1000; but varies by country due to big differences in tax
1,@patfan198010 Considering

1,@justadood We can probably just repurpose Model 3 HVAC parts. Not a big deal.
1,@flcnhvy @ItsMurphyOMG True
1,@JasonCross00 Long lasting battery + fast recharge &gt; pack swap

1,Tesla is going to develop a quiet; electric leafblower
1,@FredericLambert Yeah; there was a major change in last several months. Everyone noticed; Fred. Hello.
1,@FancyPantless @FredericLambert @Tesla Will do
1,@Torgo82 @FredericLambert Absolutely
1,@billseymour Seriously
1,@FredericLambert Also; how did you manage to get shamed into being de facto anti-Tesla by social media trolls. Jeez …
1,@FredericLambert Fred; every fire *is* investigated. Problem is those who only write about 0 injury Tesla fires while ignoring fatal combustion car fires or fail to mention any contextual statistics in their article; misleading readers into thinking EV’s have high fire risk when opposite is true.
1,@teslaownersSV @jeffleach Thanks; support super appreciated
1,@jeffleach Sad if true 😔
1,When you read double standard articles about Tesla; please ask why. Maybe there’s a good reason that isn’t obvious.
1,Reality is a Tesla; like most electric cars; is over 500% *less* likely to catch fire than combustion engine cars; which carry massive amounts of highly flammable fuel. Why is this never mentioned?
1,Over a million combustion engine (it’s right there in the name!) car fires per year &amp; thousands of deaths; but one Tesla car fire with no injuries gets biggest headlines. Why the double standard? This is a real question.
1,Those who predicted Tesla &amp; EVs would be dead &amp; autonomy would never happen are same people attacking Tesla today for 6-12 month delays; while ignoring major automakers 5+ years late. Why the double standard?
1,Almost all coverage back then said hydrogen fuel cells would destroy electric cars &amp; autonomy was between 10 years &amp; never …
1,@martinengwicht @msitver @FrankLuntz Anti-matter def wins on energy density 🤣🤣
1,@msitver @FrankLuntz Exactly. By end of this quarter; about half a million Teslas will have full self-driving hardware (pending computer swap) &amp; we will make another half million FSD cars by mid next year.
1,@ValueAnalyst1 @peterdevietien @scottwww @karpathy @Tesla @nvidia As a robotaxi; probably closer to 16 hours; accounting for empty legs; travel to charger/cleaning/service; wait times; etc. ~30 mile penalty most likely imo over ~120 paid miles. Impact is signicant for electricity cost; battery wear cost &amp; larger range pack needed.

1,@scottwww @ValueAnalyst1 @karpathy @Tesla @nvidia Exactly. Also; you can’t actually use computation from a separate GPU effectively; as you get choked on the bus; so most of the computation is irrelevant. High power; high cooling; but low true; usable TOPS. Worst of all worlds.

1,@sjensenknight It’s not a big deal. Charge to 90% to 95% &amp; you’ll be fine. At 100% state of charge; regen braking doesn’t work; because the battery is full; so car is less energy efficient.

1,@EforElectric @WSJ That tweet did take immense effort 🤣🤣 Fair point tho. Powerwall production is now ramping fast. Tesla was cell-starved last year; so we had to switch all lines to make packs for cars; which meant Powerwall production was living off scraps.

1,@Louisbotelho17 @Kristennetten @arctechinc @danahull @GinoG01328427 @Savis1949 @WSJ @Tesla @SEC_Enforcement Truth
1,@johnrobb Exactly
1,@Kristennetten @arctechinc @danahull @GinoG01328427 @Savis1949 @WSJ @Tesla @SEC_Enforcement How embarrassing. Will change.
1,@Chapter11Cases We will. You read it right.
1,@arctechinc @danahull @GinoG01328427 @Savis1949 @WSJ @Tesla @SEC_Enforcement Haha true
1,@martinengwicht @KnightmarArchon @EvBite @johnrobb @Tesla @ElonMuskScience I’ve always thought that the fundamental good of Tesla should be measured by the number of years by which it accelerates the transition to sustainable transport &amp; energy
1,@cSharp3x7 @Savis1949 @WSJ Good point; small oil is a problem too
1,@FredericLambert @GilesGraves @Savis1949 @WSJ I’m sorry; Fred; but WSJ has relentlessly attacked Tesla with bogus articles for over a decade. They can’t *all* be chalked up to poor reporting. Where are the WSJ exposé pieces on oil; coal &amp; gas? That industry is 1000 times bigger than Tesla. Perhaps they’re all angels …
1,@GinoG01328427 @Savis1949 @WSJ @Tesla Yes; this was an utter boldface (literally) lie! Unbelievable that WSJ would write something so false.
1,@GilesGraves @Savis1949 @WSJ True; Bloomberg is almost as bad
1,@Savis1949 @WSJ Holman Jenkins &amp; WSJ in general are sock 🧦 puppets of big oil
1,@grzf_ Starship is kinda Gundam
1,@KnightmarArchon @EvBite @johnrobb Very much so. There are 2.5B cars &amp; trucks on Earth. Even replacing 1% of that fleet would require making 25M vehicles per year. Tesla will make over 500k cars in next 12 months; but that’s a mere 2% of 25M or 0.02% of global vehicle fleet. Car industry slow -&gt; demand &gt;&gt; supply.
1,@Teslarati Sentry Mode fundamentally empowers the individual car owner over entrenched interests; in this case a corrupt traffic judge. Even Tesla doesn’t have access to the video unless sent to us by owner.
1,@nichegamer @NCBirbhan @CBSNews Mint berry crunch
1,@Teslarati poetic justice
1,@NCBirbhan @CBSNews Boring candy coming soon …
1,@CBSNews Mr Buffett; please stop destroying Dairy Queen. In the name of all that is holy; please stop.
1,@tsrandall Wow; a lot of people don’t know much about how manufacturing works! If you have peak capacity of X; actual average weekly output will necessarily be less than X. First 6-12 months; it will be much less than X. Impossible to predict exact production ramp S-curve.
1,@tsrandall There is 35 GWh/yr “theoretical capacity”; but actual max output is ~2/3. It was physically impossible to make more Model 3’s in Q1 due to cell constraints.
1,@GregMatson Yes; all cars with Autopilot 2.0 or higher; so ~400;000 of Tesla cars built to date
1,@Erdayastronaut @kneibert Your interventions do train the NN; but we first verify that the training doesn’t cause other issues; so expect step rather than continuous changes in capability
1,@yaypie There will be that too; but economics will favor initial purchase
1,@Rebel44CZ Hopefully have the order page live before then. If not; will push price change out a bit later.
1,@brandonbernicky @tsrandall Not good enough yet. Pushing release by a few weeks. Will be amazing.
1,@tsrandall Incorrect. Pana cell lines at Giga are only at ~24GWh/yr &amp; have been a constraint on Model 3 output since July. No choice but to use other suppliers for Powerwall/Powerpack cells. Tesla won’t spend money on more capacity until existing lines get closer to 35GWh theoretical.
1,@kneibert Tesla will start FSD computer upgrade in a few months
1,@frozencanuck Something like that
1,Starting May 1
1,Please note that the price of the Tesla Full Self-Driving option will increase substantially over time

1,@annerajb @TeslaMilton @IanPavelko Any user input counts
1,@TeslaMilton @IanPavelko Car looks for a slightly turning force on wheel (direction is irrelevant) to confirm that driver hands are on steering wheel before initiating lane change. Just a precautionary measure until we have a few billion miles/km of real-world lane changes with reliability &gt;&gt; human.
1,@jfinkelstein It will enable video when parked &amp; connected to WiFi. All Tesla Superchargers will have free WiFi over time.

1,@DMC_Ryan Are you on Mad Max Mode? This may be too meek for places like the LA Freeway …
1,@BjornWF @Tesla Sure
1,@fatropea @dani190 Exactly
1,@dani190 Base AP will have same NN; so core functionality also improves
1,@iSay3n Many different regulatory authorities. Just takes time.
1,Latest Autopilot update is epic. Rolling out to all US owners with Enhanced Autopilot or Full Self-Driving option. International coming soon.
1,Starhopper just lifted off &amp; hit tether limits! https://t.co/eByJsq2jiw

1,@abledoc @fentrocity @Real_John_D @MitchellHagan @MarcelFeldkamp Exactly
1,“…drivers in this dataset use Autopilot for 34.8% of their driven miles; and yet appear to maintain a relatively high degree of functional vigilance.”

1,Stay positive 🧁 https://t.co/UJFreuacNP
1,@transopac @newscientist Good point
1,@transopac @newscientist How much is it?
1,@newscientist I think I’ve paid for a subscription at least three times; but your paywall keeps forgetting this
1,@newscientist Please fix your paywall. Your content is great; but your paywall is not.
1,@MitchellHagan @MarcelFeldkamp Yes; instead of someone needing to drive their car personally; they can manage a fleet of self-driving cars
1,@MarcelFeldkamp That’s exactly the idea. What’s not well understood is that Tesla cars being made *today* will be able to do that for you. Just a matter of finishing the software &amp; going through regulatory approval. Will be explained in depth via live webcast on April 22.
1,@JohnnaCrider1 @patrickc @Tesla Thanks 😀
1,@patrickc @Tesla Great work with Stripe btw. Much needed.

1,@solussd @Tesla Sentry Mode is barely at V1.0. Will improve a lot in coming months.
1,@slye @LivingTesla @Tesla Impressive analysis
1,@LivingTesla @Tesla Only external cameras are being used right now; so internal is not enabled. When it is enabled; we’ll add a setting to disable internal camera.
1,@LivingTesla @Tesla Also; it can be used to supplement cameras on outside of vehicle; as it can see through 2nd side windows &amp; rear window.
1,@LivingTesla @Tesla It’s there for when we start competing with Uber/Lyft &amp; people allow their car to earn money for them as part of the Tesla shared autonomy fleet. In case someone messes up your car; you can check the video.

1,@jake_cooley @SnazzyQ Yes; needs to drive best clear path. Lane lines are just one input.
1,@EV_Stevee @Tesla Great name 👍
1,@SnazzyQ Neural net is upgraded too in this release. It’s not just a settings change.
1,@SherylCrow @Tesla Totally agree. Tesla phone app should have all controls that car center screen has; so your phone can serve as a complete backup.
1,Starhopper completed tethered hop. All systems green.
1,@SherylCrow @Tesla Glad you like it! Sorry about the trouble earlier. Helpful feedback for improving the car!
1,This is way more awesome than it might sound
1,@EVLatino @SherylCrow @Tesla Night mode default brightness is actually too high imo. Should be lower &amp; allow below current “0%” level. Making that adjustment too.
1,@GaragedoorsGman @SherylCrow @Tesla Agreed
1,@SherylCrow @Tesla Night mode with 0% brightness is actually too dark during the day. This is ultimately our fault. We will update our software so that 0% brightness is always usable relative to ambient conditions.

1,@TesLatino @mcjamez @TeslaAnswers @flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag @Tesla Also the intense low frequency vibrations that you can’t hear; but you can feel in your chest
1,@TeslaAnswers @flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag We’re going to try. Side boosters come back to Cape; center core lands on droneship. Latter will be coming in v hot &amp; fast; so dicey.
1,@flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag Annoying that @ULA perpetuates myth that Delta IV Heavy or Atlas V can do some orbits that Falcon Heavy can’t. This is absolutely false. FH would have to go full expendable for GEO direct; but that’s very rare.
1,@Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag Probably no fairing either &amp; just 3 Raptor Vacuum engines. Mass ratio of ~30 (1200 tons full; 40 tons empty) with Isp of 380. Then drop a few dozen modified Starlink satellites from empty engine bays with ~1600 Isp; MR 2. Spread out; see what’s there. Not impossible.
1,@emilmelar Retrofits will start when our software is able to take meaningful advantage of the Tesla FSD computer; which is an order of magnitude more capable. For now; it’s slightly disadvantageous to have Tesla FSD computer; as our software is more refined for HW2.
1,@MacBenTosh Anyone who bought FSD will get it
1,Anyone who purchased full self-driving will get FSD computer upgrade for free. This is the only change between Autopilot HW2.5 &amp; HW3. Going forward “HW3” will just be called FSD Computer; which is accurate. No change to vehicle sensors or wire harness needed. This is v important.
1,@nextspaceflight @Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag Yes. Sensitive propulsion &amp; avionics remained dry. Great work by SpaceX Dragon engineering team. Major improvement over Dragon 1.
1,@Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag Massive delta velocity slam from highly elliptical Earth orbit using a fully retanked; but lightened up Starship with no heat shield or fins/legs. Best choice for the impatient. Ion engines are too slow.
1,@DiscoverMag We should send probes to outer solar system &amp; get high res; true color images of these strange things. Maybe there’s an alien artifact out there …
1,@erinwinick @techreview Super cool!
1,@martin_galway Good point
1,@ialexryan Tax authorities tend to interpret things in their favor; but it sure sounds like you could be right! Will investigate.
1,@GerberKawasaki Rare use case; but it is possible. There are complications with this. Eary prototype Roadsters had this ability.
1,@ChadyMattar Exactly
1,@_DavidMacMillan No; it is one week either way.
1,@Erdayastronaut @NASA @VP I think so. For sure worth giving it our best shot! Would be great to have a competitive; commercial program to build a moon base that is outcome-oriented (not cost-plus); so you only get paid for safe delivery of cargo.
1,@NASA @VP It would be so inspiring for humanity to see humanity return to the moon!

1,@zachary1978 @Tesla Good point
1,Hard to appreciate how much Tesla Autopilot improves enjoyment of driving until you try it
1,@SkiddlyBinx Yes; otherwise propellant usage for an atmospheric entry would be very high and/or center of mass would need to be very tightly constrained.  Yes; but we’re going to skip that at first to avoid fragging launch pads.

1,@Mathias_Wehler @Sloppy93 @Erdayastronaut @annerajb @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 Hexagonal tiles on most of windward side; no shield needed on leeward side; transpiration cooling on hotspots
1,@Sloppy93 @Erdayastronaut @annerajb @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 Only some of the hottest sections
1,@annerajb @Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 Full size
1,@annerajb @Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 We decided to skip building a new nosecone for Hopper. Don’t need it. What you see being built is the orbital Starship vehicle.
1,@Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 You can deep throttle on single shaft system by choking flow of fuel or oxygen between pump &amp; combustion chamber. Problem is more with the tiny rocket engine that powers the pump; called a gas generator. That has to throttle *way* deeper than the main chamber.
1,@nextspaceflight @Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 Working on regulatory approval for both Boca Chica; Texas; and Cape Kennedy; Florida. Will also be building Starship &amp; Super Heavy simultaneously in both locations.
1,@THE_REAL_KEAGAN @Tesla @LikeTeslaKim @BenSullins @teslainventory Agreed
1,@Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 Raptor is *very* complex; even for a staged combustion engine. We’re simplifying as much as possible with each iteration. Throttling down to ~50% is hard; but manageable. Going to 25% would be extremely tough; but hopefully not needed.
1,@omarqazi @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 Started rolling it out a few days ago. Always starts slow; find rare corner case issues; fix them; continue rollout …
1,@flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 Hopefully. Always many issues integrating engine &amp; stage. First hops will lift off; but only barely.
1,@austinbarnard45 First (really short) hops with one engine. Suborbital flights with three.
1,@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Goes against interests of all Texans
1,@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Wow; this is crazy

1,To be clear; orders are fully refundable; even after you’ve had your Tesla for a week
1,Reminder to buy our S3XY cars before midnight on Monday! Prices rise slightly worldwide on Tuesday. You can order online at https://t.co/46TXqRrsdr.
1,@lexiheft @vincent13031925 @dave_ross @Tesla Definitely down the road; once construction &amp; upgrades aren’t so crazy
1,@vincent13031925 @dave_ross @Tesla This causes some media confusion; as batch builds &amp; ship arrival times can make our sales seem incredible one month &amp; terrible following month; but consumer tastes don’t actually vary so much. Massive month over month changes are usually because of production/shipping schedules.
1,@vincent13031925 @dave_ross @Tesla Not exactly same time; as countries have different regulations &amp; we try to build in batches to simplify production
1,@dave_ross @Tesla Might arrive by June; but def before end of summer
1,@TrevorMahlmann @Tesla @PopMech Model 3 partial permanent magnet induction motor; especially with silicon carbide inverter; is so efficient that it outdoes two induction motors. If we could decouple forward induction motor to avoid spin losses; then range of dual might be higher; but that’s a lot of complexity.
1,@ColinRossUBC827 @Tesla @PopMech Exactly! In fact; better to have RWD with winter tires than AWD with summer tires. We appreciate the extra expenditure if people do buy AWD; but it isn’t critical for snowy regions.
1,@Tesla @PopMech Still get this question a lot; even though Norway 🇳🇴 has highest Tesla cars per person on 🌏 (super appreciated!). Also; AWD is nice to have; but def not required for snow/ice.

1,@TonyTesla4Life @tesla_truth @FredericLambert @jeffborden_cga @marc_benton @MrTommyCampbell @Tesla Sure
1,@TonyTesla4Life @tesla_truth @FredericLambert @jeffborden_cga @marc_benton @MrTommyCampbell @Tesla Correct
1,@fredsa @FredericLambert @jeffborden_cga @marc_benton @MrTommyCampbell @Tesla That’s the plan
1,@Syntality @FredericLambert @jeffborden_cga @marc_benton @MrTommyCampbell @Tesla Of course
1,@FredericLambert @jeffborden_cga @marc_benton @MrTommyCampbell @Tesla In retrospect; lower price shouldn’t have been offered. Was done so because some simply couldn’t afford it. Prices revert to normal on Monday.
1,@johnny0129 However; this obviously cannot be discussed with entire global stores team beforehand or news would leak
1,@johnny0129 We are still closing stores; just not as many as before. This basically splits the difference — about half as many stores closed; but then can afford only about half the price reduction. Was discussed with exec team &amp; board.
1,@jeffborden_cga @marc_benton @MrTommyCampbell @Tesla When prices go down; those who already bought want the lower price; but; if prices go up; those who already bought don’t want to write Tesla a check. So it goes.
1,@marc_benton @MrTommyCampbell Those prices will revert to normal on Monday too

1,@Drew78823936 @Erdayastronaut @DJSnM @RocketTenor @NASA @SpaceX @Space_Station @Commercial_Crew Probably right. Starship rate of progress far exceeds Falcon &amp; Dragon; although they’re critical to getting there. dInnovation/dt is what matters long-term.
1,@DJSnM @RocketTenor @NASA @SpaceX @Space_Station @Commercial_Crew For cargo missions; propulsive land landing should be no problem. Doesn’t have same safety criticality as crew.
1,@dmk184 @NASA @SpaceX @Space_Station @Commercial_Crew Pretty much any moon or planet that has a solid or liquid surface
1,@iamkostmos @NASA @SpaceX @Space_Station @Commercial_Crew Most likely; but this is contingent upon NASA review &amp; approval
1,@xandriteme @NASA @SpaceX @Space_Station @Commercial_Crew Best to use a giant brake pad; aka heat shield

1,@CopticChad @Erdayastronaut @privater @marc_benton @Teslatunity @Model3Owners @Tesla Net power to warm pack is especially low when motors are running; as coolant loop routes motor heat to the pack when outside is cold (&amp; rejects motor heat to air when outside is warm)
1,@compdemon Ukraine did play a major role
1,@Erdayastronaut @privater @marc_benton @Teslatunity @Model3Owners @Tesla Very little power &amp; only right before you get to the Supercharger. You won’t notice it in range.

1,@BasedMikeLee I’m wondering the same thing
1,@AmericaPapaBear @alx For sure
1,@alx It’s inevitable 😂
1,This platform is the #1 source of news on Earth!
1,That said; there are still far more D than R early votes! It’s just that the in-person R vote on election day is historically far higher than D.  Please bring everyone you know to early vote. You can request &amp; hand in your ballot in person at your county office.  Tomorrow is the

1,@rpoo Always was
1,Early votes in Pennsylvania now show Republicans doing 435k better than Democrats vs the same date in 2020. Biden’s margin of victory was only 80k in 2020.   Trending towards a crushing victory. https://t.co/I1sXndevlD

1,Discussion with the Neurosurgeon community
1,@ElenaRuiz_Poet @krassenstein @neuralink Maybe; but it will definitely be extremely helpful in improving understanding of the brain
1,@stillgray Accurate
1,@krassenstein @neuralink Early stage; yes; but only limited help is possible for late stage Alzheimer’s; as there there is too much neuronal loss
1,This hoax was repeated by Kamala in the debate with Trump even though she knows it’s a hoax
1,I am increasingly convinced that @Neuralink should prioritize making an implant that can eliminate back &amp; neck pain.   Would greatly improve people’s happiness while awake; as well as enhance quality of sleep.   https://t.co/kabge5XRuH
1,@SawyerMerritt Yeah
1,@TheRabbitHole84 For sure
1,@nayibbukele Super impressive
1,@Gfilche @X @XCreators I super agree!
1,Importing future voters is by far the most competent program in the Biden-Harris administration
1,@TheRabbitHole84 52% of legal immigrants being on welfare is surprisingly high
1,@minchoi @nypost Yeah.   It’s fine for writers to do so (and they have at WaPo); but not the whole company.
1,@nypost Nobody cares who WaPo endorses 😂  The writers are mostly insufferable; radical leftists and everyone knows it.  Sounds like some of the worst have left the paper; which is good.
1,@ajtourville Yeah

1,@ZubyMusic Yeah
1,Alphabet (Google/YouTube) is the #1 biggest donor to the Democratic Party

1,@Rothmus Yeah
1,Let’s turn even the blue states red!
1,@CollinRugg And they don’t even realize how big the loss will be yet
1,@WesternLensman @CollinRugg Nope
1,@andst7 Fermi was great
1,Yup; it’d be a 3 hr train wreck
1,Most important message of the night is to get everyone you know to vote and vote now!  There is always some chance of a work or personal emergency or some external factor on Nov 5th that prevents people from voting.
1,And give responsibility for streamlining legal immigration management to a competent company; as the bureaucracy is utterly broken.   It is literally easier for a serial killer to get into America than a Nobel Prize winner!
1,@ajtourville Bill Maher still can’t believe the magnitude of the illegal voter importation program under Biden-Harris even though the data is unequivocal.   There have been high triple digit increases in illegals in all swing states over the course of only three years!! That’s insane!!  It is
1,@nima_owji @stillgray Good idea
1,Anomalies in the matrix were needed
1,@HSajwanization They are truly desperate

1,@remaxbrianwilks @teslaownersSV @POTUS Thanks 🙏
1,@teslaownersSV @POTUS I was on a J-1 visa that transitioned to an H1-B.   They know this; as they have all my records.  Losing the election is making them desperate.
1,@DavidSacks They are.   Dems are now over 300k votes behind where they were in Pennsylvania in 2020; when the margin of victory was only 80k.  Cooked.
1,But all the legacy (formerly “mainstream”) media said there was no fraud.   They lied.

1,@YunTaTsai1 It’s crazy
1,Many Starships will go to Mars in 2 years; when the transit window opens again.   The first wave will be without people and the second wave; 26 months later; with people; provided the first wave does not increment the crater count on Mars.
1,@pmarca Yeah
1,@Thompsonklay @stillgray The Dems are in favor of importing voters who are beholden to them and against allowing legal immigrants who would probably vote against them.   Simple matter of incentives.
1,@tsarnick Fate does love irony.   He does kinda look younger; but skin tone is disturbingly translucent.
1,@CulperTheThird @AutismCapital What’s the worst that could happen? 😬
1,@BasedBeffJezos Kardashev or bust; baby!!
1,The Sun is ~99.8% of the entire mass of the solar system. Jupiter and Saturn are ~0.2% and everything else is a rounding error.  Moreover; the Sun is &gt;99.99% of energy output! Everything else combined is an inaudible background noise.
1,The truth will set you free
1,They are evil
1,@TeslaClubLA @teslaownersSV @POTUS I was in fact allowed to work in the US.   The Biden puppet is lying.

1,@eyeslasho False. The German economy leading up to and during WW2 was extremely state-directed. Indeed; to such a degree that it greatly undermined the war effort. WW1 Germany was head &amp; shoulders better.   Government in general is incredibly inefficient. It is the DMV at scale. Only when
1,@john @TheoVon Impressive
1,Doesn’t it seem odd that the same people who demanded that everyone have vaccine ID are now insisting that voter ID should NOT be required?
1,Big numbers
1,@tunguz He is just plain wrong. Almost the entire founding team of @SpaceX was over 30.   Over half of the founding team of Tesla was too.
1,@shellenberger Until about a month ago; early voting in 2024 favored the Dems even more than 2020.   Leading Dems told me with extreme confidence that they would win Pennsylvania. They were certain.  Then there were some anomalies in the matrix and now Republican early votes vastly exceed 2020.

1,@markpinc Great question.   I suspect that the absurd propaganda will not stop; but those spouting it will lose credibility.
1,The extreme left wing bias of legacy media is because journalists these days are extremely left wing.   They can’t even handle their newspapers not endorsing a candidate and remaining neutral!

1,The Dems have imported massive numbers of illegals to swing states. Triple digit increases over the past 4 years!  Their STATED plan is to give them citizenship as soon as possible; turning all swing states Dem.   America would then become a one-party; deep blue socialist state.

1,@Rob_2628 Wow. The return on investment for the final Paragon Points is rough 😂
1,The Atlantic is an evil publication
1,If given 4 more years to do it; the big govt machine will legalize vast numbers of illegals; making all swing states permanently deep blue; just like they did with California.  Every major Democrat politician has stated that their goal is to legalize all illegals. Believe them.
1,If they are able to do this; there will be no swing states next election
1,@AlecStapp It’s not that hard and China will succeed.   Paperwork is the biggest issue.
1,Our system is broken
1,Those against voter ID in America are the ones who want to commit election fraud
1,@stclairashley Exactly
1,This is a crisis
1,A common story.   So many people I know have been assaulted on the street or had their homes or cars robbed. Out of dozens of stories; there was not one where the criminals were sent to prison. Not one. Zero.  Enough is enough.

1,@AmericanRebble Exactly
1,@SawyerMerritt @Tesla Cool
1,@Kristennetten @iam_smx Yeah
1,@tunguz You mean in terms of what AI can do?
1,Democrats greatly outspend Republicans; have 90% of legacy media &amp; online media on their side; 90% of Hollywood celebs and a massive number of organizers on the ground.   Frankly; it’s surprising that Republicans win at all!
1,@AutismCapital They know they’re gonna lose
1,@eyeslasho That’s a big difference!
1,The margin of the Biden PA win in 2020 was ~80k votes. Just based on the early vote delta; Pennsylvania will go Republican in 2024; but we cannot be complacent.   Drag your friends &amp; family to vote now!
1,@AutismCapital Nobody cares about puppets of the machine
1,Drag 10 friends to vote!
1,@WesternLensman You’re gonna lose; @Tim_Walz 🤡   Saving the American people from the torture of hearing you speak for 4 years was worth it 😂

1,@FutureJurvetson These were done in spite of; not because of; the California government. It would be far lower cost to manufacture in other states; which is why our competitors moved out of state.  That was because I lived in California.
1,@FutureJurvetson Boeing and Lockheed moved their rocket production from California to Alabama.   SpaceX took over an abandoned aerospace building in LA County and turned it into the highest volume rocket producer in the world.   That was because I lived in California.
1,@FutureJurvetson The last automotive factory in California (NUMMI) shut down in early 2009.   Tesla took over the derelict building; after it was stripped of anything useful; and it is now the highest production car factory in the Americas!  That was simply because I lived in California.

1,Well; I did Nazi that coming! Those fools will Goebbels anything down …  I bet their pronouns are He/Himmler!
1,@JohnStossel My comment about needing UBI is in the context of a future where we have robots that can do all manual labor; not present day.   In a good AI future; we will effectively have universal high income; not basic.
1,The foaming-at-the-mouth reaction from radical leftists is worth it 🤣🤣
1,If there is not radical reduction of government expenditures; then; just like an individual who has taken on too much debt; America will become de facto bankrupt.   The interest on the debt is trending to rapidly absorb all tax revenue; leaving nothing for critical needs.
1,@VivekGRamaswamy It would blow their minds!  They intended government to be tiny and put the President in a little cottage known as The White House.   That’s how small they thought the federal government should be!
1,@ajtourville @Starlink Cool
1,@alx Zero T situation

1,Absolutely
1,@garrytan It certainly is supposed to be

1,@YunTaTsai1 Not worth pushing kids to code (or other stuff imo). I liked anything mechanical; but the second I saw a computer; you couldn’t drag me away from it! I immediately pulled two all-nighters teaching myself to program.   No pushing is required when kids love something.
1,@MarioNawfal Many topics discussed!

1,This platform is the #1 source of news on Earth!
1,Accurate
1,If the Dem big government machine wins; they will legalize illegals over the next 4 years and there will be no more “swing states”.   America will become a permanent deep blue socialist state.
1,@ddogsbbq Those were the days 🍟
1,@fentasyl Seriously
1,Please support Dave McCormick for Pennsylvania Senator
1,Triple digit increases of illegals in swing states over the past 4 years.   Voter importation at an unprecedented scale!
1,The legacy media is pure left-wing propaganda
1,@MarioNawfal Such liars

1,Concerning that he would say such a thing
1,Every night; @America will announce another $1M winner!  All you have to do is sign our petition in support of The Constitution.
1,@RealAlexJones NATO plans to give Ukraine nuclear weapons? Is this accurate @CommunityNotes?
1,All you need to do is sign the @America petition in support of the Constitutional rights to free speech &amp; bear arms to have a daily chance of winning $1;000;000!  You can be from any or no political party and you don’t even have to vote.
1,Signing our petition in support of the 1st &amp; 2nd amendments to the Constitution is all it takes!
1,@RadioGenoa Necessarily; to be a true democracy; it must be will of the PEOPLE that prevails.   No judge is greater than the consensus will of the people.
1,If given another four years; the Dem machine will legalize so many illegals that there will be no swing states.   This is what they did in California; which is now a supermajority Dem one-party state.
1,@wildbarestepf Maybe true 🤔
1,If the Democratic Party big government machine wins this election; they will ban voter ID nationwide; not just in California

1,Good rule of thumb: those who frequently use the word “disinformation” are the ones most likely to be pushing it
1,Jocelyn Michelle Benson; shame on you for blatantly lying to the public!  You only plan to remove the ineligible voters AFTER this election.   That necessarily means that there are far more people registered to vote than there eligible voters.
1,@pmarca All’s well that ends well 🚀
1,@WallStreetSilv I have not asked for; nor has DJT offered; anything whatsoever.  However; we are both in agreement that strangulation of America by overregulation needs to be stopped.  This will unleash a new era of prosperity.

1,@PTrubey @JoeTegtmeyer A fork in the road
1,Link to the petition: https://t.co/Wb3hUCxGvl
1,Every day; from now through Nov 5; @America PAC will be giving away $1M to someone in swing states who signed our petition to support free speech &amp; the right to bear arms!  We want to make sure that everyone in swing states hears about this and I suspect this will ensure they do.

1,@AutismCapital He is very funny
1,Am doing another town hall Q&amp;A tomorrow in Philadelphia
1,But now the Dems fight paper ballots tooth &amp; nail. I wonder why.
1,Sunlight is the best disinfectant
1,It is the stated goal of the Democrats to legalize all illegals; which would make all swing states permanently blue and turn America into a single-party state; just like California.
1,She was so disrespectful to Americans putting their lives at risk
1,@ScottPresler Great!
1,This was alarming to hear!
1,Most based thing you could do in a Dem neighborhood is put Trump/Vance signs on your lawn 😂  Please post pics to this thread!

1,Mark Cuban and Rachel Maddow are the same person. Don’t believe conspiracy theorists who claim otherwise!
1,@KenPaxtonTX Children cannot consent
1,The trend will continue. Usually; the Democrat ground game is far better than the Republican one. Not this time.  What’s amazing is that Democrats:  1. Are massively outspending Republicans in swing states.  2. Have the “mainstream” aka legacy media almost completely on their
1,@Geiger_Capital @NateSilver538 That’s why I’m in Pennsylvania

1,@JTLonsdale This is illegal foreign interference in US elections
1,It really will
1,This is illegal
1,Only by the far left legacy media
1,The legacy media; formerly the mainstream media; is a far left propaganda machine
1,Exactly!
1,@visegrad24 That would be an insane precedent to set
1,@shaunmmaguire The legacy media is pure propaganda
1,@farzyness Exactly. That was so messed up.

1,True
1,@BillAckman @KamalaHarris Yeah
1,@ScottPresler @JondavidRLongo Great to hear!
1,@BasedBeffJezos Exactly
1,@BasedBeffJezos Trump needs to win by a landslide. That is the goal.
1,@WallStreetSilv Yeah
1,Not even slightly. The results speak for themselves.
1,@BasedBeffJezos Fission is good; but nothing comes close to that staggeringly gigantic fusion reactor in the sky.   When you think in Kardashev terms; it becomes utterly obvious that the energy released by our Sun is all that matters.

1,Yeah …

1,@rookisaacman @SpaceX It will truly be glorious when the ship is caught too and the whole stack immediately flies again!  Full &amp; immediate (no mandatory refurbishment) reusability with low cost propellant (almost 80% liquid oxygen; no helium pressurant) will mean a marginal cost per ton ~100 times
1,This is the way

1,I hope I am able to serve the people in this regard. It is sorely needed.
1,Just inspected the Starship booster; which the arms have now placed back in its launch mount. Looks great!  A few outer engine nozzles are warped from heating &amp; some other minor issues; but these are easily addressed.  Starship is designed to achieve reflight of its rocket https://t.co/oWZoOOfHmk

1,@BillAckman @realDonaldTrump Very well said!
1,@ajtourville @SpaceX The new launch pad is already designed for the 10;000 tons of thrust version; which is almost exactly 3 times more powerful than the Saturn V Moon rocket
1,@cb_doge I hope to be able to serve in this capacity
1,@amuse If Trump is not elected; the slow strangulation by overregulation will stop humanity from reaching Mars
1,@Gfilche I sure hope so!
1,@MarcusHouse Some of the outer engine nozzles are a little warped from high heating &amp; strong aero forces. Easily fixable.
1,@netcapgirl Same
1,The Starfactory is amazing and you can see it close-up from the public road

1,@GadSaad Amazing
1,@dvorahfr An incredible epoch of civilization with a style that endures to this day
1,@MarioNawfal An 11 minute standing ovation for a bad movie has Stalin vibes
1,The left controls almost all legacy media and all major search and social media companies; except this one.   We strive to be a level playing field for all views. They do not.
1,For every person you refer who is a swing state voter; you get $47! Easy money.
1,@alx The legacy media are shills for the Dems
1,Tomorrow is the last day to register to vote in Georgia and Arizona!
1,Trump now leading Kamala by 3% in betting markets. More accurate than polls; as actual money is on the line.
1,@MarioNawfal Whoa
1,@TheGregYang Interesting
1,@Philosophi_Cat What’s the source of this data?
1,@MikeBenzCyber How times change
1,@Chesschick01 Indeed (sigh)
1,Propaganda terms are very effective

1,True
1,@realchrisrufo Wrong priorities
1,@realGeorgeHotz Yeah
1,@pmarca Feels like it
1,Saving American lives should be priority #1
1,Go Steelers!!
1,@Tim_Walz @KamalaHarris False; @realDonaldTrump has made it extremely clear that he would veto a nationwide abortion ban!  @CommunityNotes
1,What Walz is saying is utterly false.   In fact; @realDonaldTrump recently posted that he would VETO a nationwide abortion ban!  https://t.co/QdXkYQWQ1X
1,@MaryTilesTexas Yeah
1,@WesternLensman What a nut 🤣
1,Love is the answer 🥰
1,Is this accurate @CommunityNotes?
1,Join us!
1,@FCC Thanks for expediting this approval
1,Sign our petition to support the Constitution!  Also earn $47 for every person you refer to sign the petition if they’re in a swing state.   Goal is to get 1M voters in swing states to show support for free speech &amp; right to bear arms.
1,Exactly

1,Definitely not
1,@TrungTPhan Groan
1,@WesternLensman Lmaooo
1,Bring. It. On.
1,Low bar tbh. Unlike the border; we actually check IDs for the event 🤣🤣

1,Check your voting registration status!

1,@FalkoTen @sovereignbrah @MedGold_ There was a massive shift with the advent of birth control
1,@teslaownersSV I was about this meme tbh 😂
1,@CollinRugg Yeah … news flash; Hilary; you’re not supposed to HAVE total control!!
1,I’m hearing this anti free speech bs being parroted by pretty much every leading Dem &amp; their legacy media puppets
1,@tsarnick True … sigh
1,This is so crazy
1,Incredible crowd today at the rally in Pennsylvania https://t.co/pamx8yAMd8
1,Make sure everyone you know has registered to vote! Only 2 days left to do so in Georgia &amp; Arizona. https://t.co/QDrxjHQjXG
1,True
1,@cb_doge Yeah
1,@SERobinsonJr That was an amazing rally!
1,@cb_doge And they insisted on vaccine ID to travel anywhere; but also insist on no ID to vote!  Something very rotten about that.
1,@mayemusk It’s a different world if someone only reads legacy media propaganda

1,Make America Based Again!
1,@TeslaBoomerMama “We lose total control” implies that they have almost total control already; which seems true based on how the legacy media all mysteriously have the exact same talking points at the exact same time.   The media all said Biden was “sharp as a tack” right before the debate where
1,@ScottPresler Great!
1,@SaysSimonson He’s shopping for fancy clothes while people are suffering from hurricane damage. This is some Hunger Games shit.
1,@WholeMarsBlog Expensive and slow
1,@IterIntellectus Very autistic expression I have in this pic 😂
1,@RichardHanania The anti baby propaganda is powerful
1,@shaunmmaguire @america Thanks!
1,@JTLonsdale They’re literally on camera saying the exact opposite thing and treating the public like fools!
1,That’s how easy it is to turn on Starlink!  Works anywhere 5 minutes after you take it out of the box.
1,Those against freedom of speech are the bad guys!
1,If @realDonaldTrump doesn’t win; the “Democratic” Party will legalize so many illegals that there will be no swing states!  America will become a single-party socialist state; just like what happened to California; where they just made requiring voter ID illegal.
1,Almost 10 million people watching!  https://t.co/qg31Yb8zhZ
1,You’re most welcome!
1,This is the most important election of your LIFE!!  And there are only 2 days left to register to vote in Arizona &amp; Georgia before it’s too late!  Make sure everyone you know &amp; everyone you meet has registered to vote. The fate of our civilization is at stake.
1,Anyone else seeing this sort of thing?

1,Exactly. Vote against the machine!
1,Crazy
1,This is the PAC that I created to support candidates who believe in the core values of America
1,@GailAlfarATX Literally
1,Not right
1,Exactly; the whole country will be like California politically; which is a one-party state
1,Racism in any form is abhorrent and those who push it should be shunned
1,To paraphrase Milton Friedman: the worst results come from people spending other people’s money on a different group of other people. That is the government!
1,216;000 voters on the list in Arizona in violation of the law
1,@stillgray Exactly
1,Read the America PAC website to understand why I support @realDonaldTrump
1,Headed to Pennsylvania to speak at the @realDonaldTrump rally in Butler!
1,If @realDonaldTrump doesn’t win; the Democrats will have 4 years to turn swing states in permanent deep blue states
1,Register to vote in Arizona. Only 2 days left!
1,The Democratic Party is openly stating that they want to change the Constitution to end free speech!
1,@nima_owji @XGaming Cool
1,@AlexBerenson Seriously; who is running the country?
1,@HSajwanization @FAANews Yeah!!
1,Action is being taken to stop fraudulent voting in Arizona
1,Exactly
1,So true 🤣🤣
1,@ajtourville Doesn’t seem like SpaceX and ULA are being treated equally before the law
1,@IterIntellectus Sounds great!
1,@BasedBeffJezos Yeah
1,@GadSaad @JoeBiden @SpeakerPelosi @KamalaHarris Wow; that is next-level bad 😳
1,@GadSaad Insane that someone could advocate racial genocide and not be ostracized!  She should be completely shunned from society.
1,Super important to get all your friends and family to register to vote.   Georgia’s registration deadline is Monday!!
1,The same people who demanded you must have a vaccine ID to travel are demanding no ID to vote!
1,@StephenKing Vote for @realDonaldTrump to save democracy!!
1,@stillgray @FAANews They might be thirsty 🤷‍♂️
1,@ZubyMusic Indeed 😔
1,If there is a Democratic Party victory this election; they will ban voter ID requirements nationwide; enabling massive voter fraud.  Banning voter ID is their stated goal – they are not hiding it!  After that; your vote won’t matter; so this is therefore the last real election.
1,The term “far right” has been watered down so much by the legacy media as to render the term meaningless by historical standards; which is a terrible thing for them to do
1,Just offering @FAANews some tea 🤣🤣
1,California passed a law last week that made it ILLEGAL to ask for ID in elections!  Literally impossible to prove fraud there now. https://t.co/QAOhO6ajfr
1,@StephenKing He hasn’t been President for 4 years! Is anything NOT his fault?
1,@cstanley Problem has been resolved. Kudos to @SecretaryPete.
1,@TurkeyBeaver @Starlink @fema @JoeBiden Approval received
1,@SecretaryPete Thanks for expediting approval for support flights.   Just wanted to note that Sec Buttigieg is on the ball.
1,@SecretaryPete Thanks for helping simplify the FAA NOTAM. Support flights are now underway. Much appreciated.
1,@BasedBeffJezos Yeah
1,@SecretaryPete Thanks for the call. Hopefully; we can resolve this soon.
1,@greg_price11 Just outright lying wow
1,@SecretaryPete Still waiting … the helicopter is trying to land to deliver critical supplies. What’s the number to call?
1,@nima_owji Good idea
1,What the hell
1,@SecretaryPete Are you saying this man and hundreds of others are all lying?
1,@SecretaryPete There are hundreds of reports of FEMA/FAA blocking flights. This literally just happened.   I will follow you. Please DM me the number to call.
1,@ValentinaForUSA @fema Yeah; it’s not just SpaceX. They won’t let anyone help!
1,@nichegamer Tencent has made many smart moves. Impressive execution.
1,@twatterbaas South Africa is such a beautiful country
1,SpaceX engineers are trying to deliver Starlink terminals &amp; supplies to devastated areas in North Carolina right now and @FEMA is both failing to help AND won’t let others help. This is unconscionable!!  They just took this video a few hours ago; where you can see the level of https://t.co/abpOsfNenF
1,@ajtourville Absolutely. Like many people; I have had ENOUGH of this dangerously incompetent and partisan administration!
1,Beautifully said

1,@cb_doge And we have already with Grok 1
1,@ajtourville Really?
1,@iamyesyouareno This is bizarre and super racist of them
1,@elon_docs 💯  We are seeing this right now with FEMA.   They stated on their website that DEI was their top priority!
1,Unless Trump wins and we get rid of the mountain of smothering regulations (that have nothing to do with safety!); humanity will never reach Mars.   This is existential.
1,Starlink connectivity directly from our satellites to mobile phones will be profoundly important and save many lives when there are natural or human-driven disasters
1,One could perhaps debate whether this is deliberate or accidental; but not that it is occurring.   The migrant settlement numbers and locations come from US government data under a Democratic administration!
1,@ajtourville @xai Worth noting that @xAI has been and will open source its models; including weights and everything;   As we create the next version; we open source the prior version; as we did with Grok 1 when Grok 2 was released.
1,Just received this note from a SpaceX engineer helping on the ground in North Carolina.   @FEMA is not merely failing to adequately help people in trouble; but is actively blocking citizens who try to help!  “Hey Elon; update here on site of Asheville; NC. We have powered up two

1,@zoltanspox @PM_ViktorOrban Accurate
1,Cool
1,@BasedBeffJezos True
1,Yes; they are literally using YOUR tax dollars to import voters and disenfranchise you!    It is happening right in front of your eyes.   And FEMA used up its budget ferrying illegals into the country instead of saving American lives. Treason.
1,If I bring up Trump in LA; people react like they got shot with a dart containing rabies and crystal meth 😂
1,Is this for real?
1,@jasondebolt Yeah
1,@brianeskow 😂  Well; in fairness; a Republican today is just a Democrat from &lt;10 years ago!

1,@eyeslasho @pthread_mutex_t Bro; don’t straw man my argument …  It takes 5 years to go from permanent residency to citizenship or just 3 years via marriage.   That is roughly one Presidential election cycle. The vast number of illegals brought in over the past four years will be legalized as quickly as

1,@WesternLensman Yeah
1,@BillyM2k Exactly! Current immigration policy makes no sense. It’s totally ass-backwards.
1,Here is a detailed explanation of how the Democratic Party is turning all swing states; and thereby the whole country; into a permanent one-party state.   It is happening before your very eyes.
1,@GuntherEagleman Heartwarming to see so many people trying to help

1,@PlanetOfMemes If someone is a great nurse; doctor; engineer; carpenter; plumber; electrician; teacher; scientist; etc; they should be welcomed!
1,@alx If they’re all made legal; then there will be no illegals! Problem solved 😂
1,As a reminder; I am very much in favor of expedited legal immigration for anyone who is talented; hardworking and honest.  America should be like a pro sports team that wants to win the championship – draft the best players to enable the whole team to win!
1,@cb_doge Yeah!
1,The Kamala Dem machine wants to legalize all illegals; which would turn all swing state blue immediately and ensure permanent one-party rule in America!
1,It’s only a matter of time before the illegals in the swing states are legally able to vote. If it were up to leading Dems; they would be allowed to vote right now!  Here is Schumer saying exactly that: https://t.co/eSd8bma8Aq
1,@BillAckman @POTUS @KamalaHarris @DNC Doesn’t it seem strange that Biden; nominally the Commander in Chief of the United States; had to make a groveling apology for accidentally calling illegals ‘illegals’ during his speech to Congress?  https://t.co/P0ODHqXQgK  The word “undocumented” is such a bullshit word! Makes
1,@BillAckman @POTUS @KamalaHarris @DNC One can certainly debate whether this is a deliberate strategy by the Democrats; but not that there are massive; triple digit increases in migrants to swing states. That is an unequivocal fact.   It is also a fact that illegals vote overwhelmingly Democrat when legalized; as

1,@GailAlfarATX The vibe @xAI is great!
1,@Rob_2628 What’s your best guess at which builds will reach the highest level pits?
1,@TeslaBoomerMama Not any one person; as far as I know. There is the Soros bogeyman; of course; and various Dem leaders; but no single mastermind.   It seems to be a simple matter of incentives: the more illegals imported; the higher the Dem vote over time. It will only backfire on the Dems if
1,@shaunmmaguire True 😔
1,@hyhieu226 @grok We need the Grok Doc!
1,The Dems are doing deliberate voter importation to swing states &amp; fast-tracking them to citizenship.  The only question is when (not if) enough migrants can vote to flip all swing states; shifting the whole country to permanent one-party rule; just like what happened to

1,@TheRabbitHole84 True
1,@TheRabbitHole84 Wow; no limit at all; even if the baby is viable outside the womb?  If the pregnancy is so far advanced that a baby can survive outside the womb; then they’re unequivocally killing a baby.
1,Also; common sense.   People need to live somewhere; so unless they move to a town with a lot of extra houses (true in some places; but not all places in America); there will be upward pressure on house prices proportionate to the influx of people.
1,@marvinvonhagen @yo_yes0 @OpenAI @xai OpenAI certainly didn’t start out polished
1,Look at the law that was passed yesterday in California making it illegal to ask for ID when voting. It is harder to buy something at Costco than vote! This is insane.  Or the censorship law that California passed a month ago banning political parody!   This will happen
1,Correct
1,@PlanetOfMemes Good question
1,@stclairashley @alx Yeah; that was weird
1,True
1,@Liv_Boeree They were rather civil
1,The Dem machine will absolutely implement censorship if given another four years to do so

1,@krassenstein Yeah
1,@PlanetOfMemes Very likely
1,This is the state website to do online registration: https://t.co/GYagpUQMdu
1,If you live in Pennsylvania and haven’t registered to vote; you only have 20 days left to do so!  Please register to vote and ask your friends &amp; family to do so too. This is a very important election.
1,Very accurate
1,@SmokeAwayyy OpenAI cannot be trusted
1,@knocking4Trump @theamericapac Sorry; so many dumb things happening. Working on fixing.
1,xAI open house in SF tonight!
1,@historyinmemes Cool
1,@tomselliott This is going to make the public hate him next-level
1,@ID_AA_Carmack So long as those charging high prices don’t do bad things to stop new entrants who will lower the price; that is absolutely true
1,That is my strong belief
1,We are making a system update to allow all Starlinks in the affected areas to work; regardless of payment.   Software update hopefully completed tonight. Tomorrow at the latest.
1,Crazy!!
1,We’re getting as many Starlinks as possible to areas affected by the hurricane
1,@Rothmus That’s always how it starts
1,@WallStreetSilv Overprescribing
1,It’s worth getting Starlink as an emergency backup; even if you have a crazy fast landline.   Never know when a crisis might happen and you could help all the people around you stay connected too.
1,@CilComLFC Lawfare is happening everywhere
1,@stillgray If it ever recovers
1,Great post
1,@TheRabbitHole84 Republicans used to be the “mean &amp; judgy” party and now it is the Democrats

1,@charliekirk11 The big government machine
1,@PeterSweden7 Great! Common sense prevails.
1,@Rob_2628 What level of OP is Spiritborn? 😂
1,@eyeslasho He’s making the right move from what I can see; but sustained prosperity will take a few years.   Argentina has to have free international currency exchange; equal rule of law for all; domestic and foreign; and a balanced budget. Prosperity will then follow; as it always has.
1,@spacesudoer Absolutely!  That would be such an inspiring future 💫
1,@RodFergusson Congrats to the team on making a great game!
1,@NikoWrex Exactly
1,@mybroadband That would be great. I would to invest in and otherwise support South Africa!
1,@SmallPettingZoo @Diablo @AnnacakeLive New pets! I’m guessing half the players will be Spiritborn; including me 😂  Looking forward to trying a new class. I know Druid way better than I know the back of my hand.
1,@Diablo Guess so 😂
1,And you know what’s going immediately; not 2 days later!
1,@akafacehots Nope; I just like working; making products people love and spending time with friends &amp; family
1,@ArmGamb Yeah
1,@lrocket @foundersfund Congrats!
1,This would be beautiful
1,I hope the public is starting to understand just how evil &amp; dangerous the woke mind virus is to our civilization – it is suicidal
1,@ajtourville @Starlink This is really important.   The rule should be that Starlink can operate at whatever power level does not disrupt other communication systems; not some arbitrarily low power limit!
1,Dude had more yachts than me!
1,Having a weak President is dangerous to world security
1,@iamyesyouareno I think it’s great that America is so diverse; but this does seem asymmetric
1,@ajtourville @Starlink Starlink prices must roughly match the rate of inflation in any given country
1,Almost all vehicles will be purely electric long-term. Combustion cars will be a niche; like horses.
1,@Indian_Bronson Yikes
1,What the heck is going on?
1,@BasedMikeLee Exactly
1,@ajtourville @SpaceX @Starlink Absolutely
1,@stillgray Yeah
1,To understand the nightmare of where far left politics takes you; just walk around downtown San Francisco
1,@GadSaad I know several people who got myocarditis. I almost had to go to the hospital after my second booster shot; which was mandatory in order to travel.
1,@BrotherMikeyX From what current compensation?
1,@shaunmmaguire So true
1,Solar power is growing super fast.   In the very long-term (Kardashev Scale); solar will be &gt;99% of all power generation.
1,This is so crazy
1,@ajtourville @Starlink @FCC By the way; the price could be much less if the government didn’t insist on so many crazy requirements that add no value
1,@ajtourville @Starlink @FCC True
1,@ajtourville @Tesla Wow; and here I am mistakenly thinking people love talking about ASS 😂
1,@sfmcguire79 Makes sense
1,Well; I’m really bad at figure skating. Does that I should still get a gold medal? 🤷‍♂️

1,@Caitlyn_Jenner @Starlink Thanks!
1,The FCC is breaking the law
1,@SethDillon Good for you!
1,Mind-blowing that the Democratic Party is massively outspending the Republican Party in swing states!  The Democrats have become the party of the rich and entitled (just look at their donor list) and the Republicans have become the party of the people.
1,@BehizyTweets Crazy
1,@alx True
1,Uh what!?
1,@tunguz Best ever
1,@EvaVlaar @AfD The idea that stopping people from voting somehow “saves democracy” is utter nonsense
1,@BillAckman The difference is stark
1,@mayemusk True
1,The woke mind virus is deadly to those it infects
1,@tunguz Just the C++. C will be there forever.
1,The same people who demanded that you have a vaccine ID to travel are now demanding that there be no ID for voting
1,Great
1,To be precise; the machine that controls the Kamala puppet will come after me even more than it currently does
1,Exactly
1,@cb_doge Exactly
1,@BrotherMikeyX What is he demanding?
1,@ProjectVirginia “$60 billion wired immediately” – Biden
1,@cboyack Thanks :)
1,Reality gets stranger by the day
1,Absolutely
1,This is crazy. FEMA’s top priority is supposed to be saving the lives of America citizens.
1,Thanks @reedhastings!
1,It’s true
1,@lexfridman Thanks
1,Same goes for italics and any other formatting. They are being abused for engagement farming
1,Justice prevails
1,Yeah; the legacy media deliberately pushed this lie over and over again; knowing it was false
1,Worth posting again lol https://t.co/hRbz89kWNB
1,@stclairashley Literally! Your average library has more identity verification than California requires for voting.   I wonder why 🤔
1,Since the Hurricane Helene disaster; SpaceX has sent as many Starlink terminals as possible to help areas in need.  Earlier today; @realDonaldTrump alerted me to additional people who need Starlink Internet in North Carolina. We are sending them terminals right away.
1,Due to immediate and excessive use of bold font on 𝕏; it will be removed from view in the main timeline.   You will have to click on post details to see anything in bold. My eyes are bleeding.
1,They mean it too. Trump must win to preserve the Constitution!
1,Wow; it is now illegal to require voter ID in California!   They just made PREVENTING voter fraud against the law.   The Joker is in charge.
1,Nice work!
1,@DriveGreen80167 Sure
1,@Nigel_Farage Why does the media keep calling you far-right?   What are your policies?
1,@WarClandestine They all turned on Biden in unison immediately. Very odd …
1,@unlimited_ls This is why Tesla vehicle have automatic overheat protection to safeguard kids &amp; pets
1,@MarioNawfal Yeah
1,@BasedMikeLee The truth is somewhere in the middle.  Climate change risk is overstated in the near-term; but probably accurate in the long-term.  All that matters is how many billions of tons of carbon are transferred from deep underground into the atmosphere and oceans; aka the “surface
1,The law is violating the law
1,Accurate
1,@JamesMelville This is silly. Leave the farmers alone! It won’t matter for climate change.
1,@JonErlichman Absolutely the right attitude.   During the toilet paper shortages of Covid; I was making sure that our factories and offices had toilet paper!
1,@stclairashley In high doses; it is very dangerous
1,True; first time I’ve seen Republicans &amp; Democrats agree on something in a long time 😂
1,@cb_doge But it will boil the oceans much sooner than that

1,Absolutely
1,@harsimranbansal Canada requires charging by the minute vs kWh. We’re working to get that changed.
1,@harsimranbansal Will find out. Our aspiration is just to make a modest return vs the fully-considered price of Supercharging.
1,@JimPethokoukis Good point. SpaceX &amp; Tesla would probably have died; since both narrowly escaped bankruptcy in 2008.
1,Sustainable energy generation from sun &amp; wind is making great progress!
1,@Free_Space @thesheetztweetz @AviationWeek SpaceX will do the right thing for OneWeb; even though they are a competitor
1,@TeslaOwnersUK FSD Beta should be available in Europe for LHD this summer; RHD a few months later. These dates depend on regulatory approval.
1,@Teslarati @ResidentSponge I mean we’re basically identical – a few differences maybe …
1,@SawyerMerritt The UAW stole millions from workers; whereas Tesla has made many workers millionaires (via stock grants). Subtle; but important difference.

1,@teslaownersSV @BillyM2k @nichegamer Some people use meditation or yoga to calm their mind at the end of the day; but video games on hardcore mode work best for me
1,@teslaownersSV @BillyM2k @nichegamer I suppose it would be Elden Ring.   Finished Halo Infinite on legendary; which was not easy for my ancient neurons!  Terminator: Resistance is underrated; although the machines will be *much* better than this &amp; have 360 deg long-range FoV (sigh).  Cyberpunk is brilliant.
1,@BillyM2k @nichegamer Played some &amp; will continue. I use 🐭 &amp; ⌨️; which is suboptimal; but ok with remapping.  Art is incredible; story is good; altho I’m still confused about what’s going on haha. Nonlinear play style &amp; no spoon-feeding are cool.
1,@SDonziger @YouTube @Chevron Haha fine; I probably don’t disagree with you; but even if I did then still!!
1,@SDonziger @YouTube @Chevron I disagree with you; but I disagree with deleting your stuff even more. That’s what free speech is about.
1,Starlink 🛰 team too! Expecting over 4200 Starlink satellites in operation within 18 months; which is ~2/3 of all active satellites of Earth.
1,@Rainmaker1973 Amazing what a zillion tiny cannonballs can do!

1,@Rainmaker1973 Funny to think that sapphire is just corroded aluminum!
1,@ilyasut I just did. Now what?
1,@teslaownersSV This is pretty good. 10.12 will have major improvements for tricky unprotected lefts &amp; heavy traffic in general. We’re also making good progress with single stack.
1,@MosheShekhter @Tesla Looking into it

1,@PPathole True
1,@WSBChairman Haha that would sickkk
1,@Cernovich Doesn’t sound very balanced

1,The movie Gaslight has gaslit so many people it’s insane
1,@muratpak You mean email?
1,Twitter algorithm should be open source
1,@BillyM2k @waitbutwhy The algorithm needs to be open source
1,@waitbutwhy I’m worried about de facto bias in “the Twitter algorithm” having a major effect on public discourse.   How do we know what’s really happening?
1,@Rainmaker1973 True. And even a 10% reduction in g would make reaching orbit relatively easy.
1,@thesheetztweetz @QuiltyAnalytics First Starship orbital flight will be with Raptor 2 engines; as they are much more capable &amp; reliable. 230 ton or ~500k lb thrust at sea level.  We’ll have 39 flightworthy engines built by next month; then another month to integrate; so hopefully May for orbital flight test.
1,@thesheetztweetz @QuiltyAnalytics SpaceX default plan was ~65% of global launch mass to orbit this year. Incremental demand might take that to ~70%; so not a major change. Those numbers don’t count Starship.  Rough math is ~16 tons * 50 launches = 800 tons. Rest of world is &lt;400 tons (mostly China).

1,As it ends the cycle of retribution
1,The limbic instinct for vengeance is incredibly strong; which is why turn the other cheek is such a powerful idea
1,@mgsiegler Absolutely
1,@teslaownersSV @PaperBagInvest True. That was mega pain.
1,@PaperBagInvest But reaching volume production with sustained positive cash flow was last achieved by an American car company; Chrysler; ~100 years ago!  Ford &amp; Tesla are the only American car companies to avoid bankruptcy. Even GM &amp; Chrysler went bankrupt in 2009.
1,@PaperBagInvest Prototypes are easy; production is hard.   Making an electric car was not the hard part of Tesla – dozens of companies have done that.
1,@MrManderly @mysteriouskat @Independent @rustyrockets Good point. Politicians &amp; political parties should be supported on their merits; not like they are one’s favorite sports team.
1,@Independent With so many mainstream media companies saying @rustyrockets is crazy/dangerous; I watched some of his videos. Ironically; he seemed more balanced &amp; insightful than those condemning him!  The groupthink among major media companies is more troubling. There should be more dissent.
1,@WholeMarsBlog FSD releasing to Canada next week
1,@Rainmaker1973 Yeah :)
1,I have so much respect for the associates doing an honest day’s work at Tesla or SpaceX building &amp; servicing cars; rockets; Starlinks; batteries; solar &amp; many other things
1,Working hard to make useful products &amp; services for your fellow humans is deeply morally good
1,Working on Master Plan Part 3
1,@WholeMarsBlog Took us way too long
1,@wowsuchcurrency True; I do support the current thing haha!
1,@pmarca Yeah
1,@engineers_feed Hardcore
1,@WholeMarsBlog They have no idea how hard FSD is. Only path to success imo is hardcore real-world AI software with dedicated NN inference acceleration ASICs in car; multibillion dollar NN training supercluster and 10+ billion miles of vehicle data. Good luck.
1,Thank you for the offer; but such excellent training would give me too much of an advantage.   If he is afraid to fight; I will agree to use only my left hand and I am not even left-handed.  Elona

1,By the pricking of my thumbs …
1,There is a beauty to the biological substrate
1,@saylor As a general principle; for those looking for advice from this thread; it is generally better to own physical things like a home or stock in companies you think make good products; than dollars when inflation is high.  I still own &amp; won’t sell my Bitcoin; Ethereum or Doge fwiw.
1,@saylor It is not entirely unpredictable that you would reach that conclusion
1,And we are not alone https://t.co/1RpsIbGWMl
1,Tesla &amp; SpaceX are seeing significant recent inflation pressure in raw materials &amp; logistics
1,@jchybow If this version performs well; we can probably lower min safety score to 95
1,What are your thoughts about probable inflation rate over next few years?
1,@RationalEtienne Always worth reading about the many civilizations that have risen and fallen … lessons we should take to heart.   There is danger to a “United Earth” in that it may result in a collective fall or ossification of civilization.

1,@WholeMarsBlog @Erdayastronaut @CopSub This weekend
1,@FedorovMykhailo @OMarkarova You’re welcome. We have also sent power adapters for car cigarette lighters; solar/battery packs and generators for places where electricity is not available.
1,@PPathole @SpaceX Optimized; fully-reusable Starship is ~150t to same reference orbit as Saturn V. In expendable mode; Starship payload would be 250t to 300t.
1,@Erdayastronaut @CopSub In our experience; COPV gain/pain flattens out above 6000 psi and is &lt;1 above 10;000 psi; unless volume constrained like Dragon.   Heating from pressurization &amp; cooling from depressurization also become major problems at very high pressure.
1,@Kristennetten @BBCScienceNews There is no direct evidence of that ad being run; but that does sum up the sales pitch. It is mind-blowing that he &amp; his crew *rowed* to a whaling station from the Antarctic!
1,@EvaFoxU Very important that there be an organization tasked with regulation removal or the number of rules will grow every year until progress is completely buried by bureaucracy!
1,Another 48 Starlinks just reached orbit
1,@BBCScienceNews Cool

1,@GailAlfarATX @Tesla @TeslaSolar @japan @vigold @SirineAti @DimaZeniuk @DogeUniversal @cb_doge @elonmuskbooks It was an honor
1,Also nuclear is vastly better for global warming than burning hydrocarbons for energy
1,For those who (mistakenly) think this is a radiation risk; pick what you think is the worst location. I will travel there &amp; eat locally grown food on TV.  I did this in Japan many years ago; shortly after Fukushima. Radiation risk is much; much lower than most people believe.
1,Hopefully; it is now extremely obvious that Europe should restart dormant nuclear power stations and increase power output of existing ones.   This is *critical* to national and international security.

1,@Rainmaker1973 Polytopia is *way* better imo; if you like strategy games
1,@Rainmaker1973 Chess is a simple game. Understandable when all we had to play with were squirrels 🐿 and  rocks🪨; but now we have computers 💻.
1,@drbarnard @GE_Appliances Basic appliances should not connect to the Internet or have significant compute power or they will/are/have obviously be turned into an army of ddos puppets
1,@BillyM2k @OfficialABQ Maybe Tesla should make an AI vision device that plugs into these legacy traffic lights. It could just look at traffic &amp; automatically maximize throughput.
1,@ICannot_Enough Beta 10.12 probably releases Tuesday in US and Friday in Canada
1,@BronxViking718 Terminator Resistance is a good game
1,Even some of the best AI software engineers in the world don’t realize how advanced Tesla AI has become
1,@ICannot_Enough We are almost at the point where interventions are so rare on city streets that we can turn our attention to applying the code to highways.   No point in doing so until passing that threshold.
1,@ChristianWalk1r Increased oil &amp; gas production in the short term is critical or people around the world will be placed under great duress.   This is not a question of money; it is a question of having enough energy to power civilization.
1,@teslaownersSV @SpaceX @NASA To be clear; SpaceX wasn’t given $1.5B – we were given a contract for cargo delivery to &amp; from Space Station that would amount to $1.5B if successful
1,@teslaownersSV @SpaceX @NASA My old delta-v mug!
1,@TheBabylonBee Pshaw; how pedestrian! I was thinking more … space dragons with “lasers”
1,@PPathole Alternate name for our company was Faraday; who invented the electric motor; whereas Nikola Tesla invented the AC induction motor
1,@SpacePadreIsle In a way; this is free QA haha
1,@teslaownersSV A beautiful home for life
1,@SpacePadreIsle Some Starlink terminals near conflict areas were being jammed for several hours at a time. Our latest software update bypasses the jamming.  Am curious to see what’s next!
1,@RogerYar All news sources are partially propaganda; some more than others
1,Starlink has been told by some governments (not Ukraine) to block Russian news sources. We will not do so unless at gunpoint.  Sorry to be a free speech absolutist.
1,SpaceX reprioritized to cyber defense &amp; overcoming signal jamming.   Will cause slight delays in Starship &amp; Starlink V2.
1,@MichaelTChiass1 @Cole00708909 Who; me? 🙄
1,@GailAlfarATX Exactly
1,And also my sympathies to the great people of Russia; who do not want this
1,🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦 Hold Strong Ukraine 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
1,Obviously; this would negatively affect Tesla; but sustainable energy solutions simply cannot react instantaneously to make up for Russian oil &amp; gas exports.
1,Hate to say it; but we need to increase oil &amp; gas output immediately.   Extraordinary times demand extraordinary measures.
1,@RenataKonkoly @MLUKBrandenburg @gigafactory_4 @Gf4Tesla @Gruenheide4futr @Stk_Brandenburg Haha sure :)
1,@teslaownersSV @tobyliiiiiiiiii Game on
1,@tobyliiiiiiiiii Almost all Viasat Ukraine user terminals were rendered permanently unusable by a Russian cyberattack on day of invasion; so … yes
1,@shortword @eddyiskongz Yes; provided no metal particles in paint
1,@eddyiskongz Place light camouflage over antenna to avoid visual detection
1,@eddyiskongz Turn on Starlink only when needed and place antenna away as far away from people as possible
1,Important warning: Starlink is the only non-Russian communications system still working in some parts of Ukraine; so probability of being targeted is high. Please use with caution.
1,@Teslarati @ResidentSponge In class action lawsuits; the actual plaintiff is always the class action law firm. They just find someone willing to serve as a puppet to “represent the class”.
1,@FedorovMykhailo @SpaceX @SpaceXStarlink @Honda @ChampionGen @westinghouse @DuroMaxPower Updating software to reduce peak power consumption; so Starlink can be powered from car cigarette lighter.  Mobile roaming enabled; so phased array antenna can maintain signal while on moving vehicle.
1,@SpaceX 🇺🇸🇺🇸  American Broomstick  🇺🇸🇺🇸 https://t.co/r2hJvFQosS
1,@WhatsupFranks @Teslarati @ResidentSponge Yeah; maybe 98
1,@Teslarati @ResidentSponge This old YouTube clip helps explain why former UAW members who work at Tesla are not huge fans of UAW https://t.co/dncVvZrkoL
1,@ICannot_Enough @genesimmons @JoeBiden By the way; Tesla factory worker compensation is the highest in the auto industry https://t.co/Peo3qtYc5D
1,@ICannot_Enough @genesimmons @JoeBiden Our real challenge is Bay Area has negative unemployment; so if we don’t treat and compensate our (awesome) people well; they have many other offers and will just leave!  I’d like hereby to invite UAW to hold a union vote at their convenience. Tesla will do nothing to stop them.
1,@genesimmons @JoeBiden Actually; we still operate our California factory; which is the largest auto plant in North America; at full capacity and are considering expanding it significantly.  It has built 2/3 of all electric vehicles in North America; twice as much as all other carmakers combined.
1,@katlinegrey @Rogozin Ukraine civilian Internet was experiencing strange outages – bad weather perhaps? – so SpaceX is helping fix it
1,@FedorovMykhailo @Brian_J_Berger @SpaceX @SpaceXStarlink @Honda @ChampionGen @westinghouse @DuroMaxPower @W__Home Solar area will need to be higher with obscuration; but works better than one might think
1,@WholeMarsBlog We could’ve made a 600 mile Model S 12 months ago; but that would’ve made the product worse imo; as 99.9% of time you’d be carrying unneeded battery mass; which makes acceleration; handling &amp; efficiency worse. Even our 400+ mile range car is more than almost anyone will use.
1,@teslaownersSV 🤣🤣 That was me tweeting from @SpaceX when someone else had snatched my name.   I was actually one of the earliest Twitter users; but dropped my account because people were tweeting such trivialities at first. @westcoastbill convinced me to get back in.
1,@WholeMarsBlog The probability of Tesla dying in 2008/2009 was very high. We closed our financing round at 6pm on Dec 24th – the last working hour of the last day before Tesla would otherwise bounce payroll.
1,@JasonDanheiser @WholeMarsBlog @28delayslater Self-driving cars &amp; useful humanoid robots require a sophisticated understanding of reality. I am increasingly convinced that they are on the path to solving AGI.   Should AGI be solved? I don’t know; but humanity is moving rapidly in this direction whether I like it or not.
1,@RealLifeLore22 Pretty good summary; although national pride is underweighted relative to economics. Latter serves former; not other way around.   The foundational issue imo; which this video doesn’t ignore; is low birth rate. After all; what good is land with no people?

1,@JoeBiden Tesla has created over 50;000 US jobs building electric vehicles &amp; is investing more than double GM + Ford combined  [fyi to person controlling this twitter]
1,@teslaownersSV @WholeMarsBlog Our primary challenge is affordability. Creating an expensive truck is relatively easy.   If it is extremely hard to do so for Tesla; despite our much greater economies of scale &amp; better technology; then it is damn near impossible for others.

1,@WholeMarsBlog @moneymik3420 @jack @gdb Yeah; definitely don’t use C unless optimizing for hardware performance!
1,@jack @gdb I’m a fan of Rust. Clearly scales well; given that Discord uses it.  For max performance; however; nothing beats tight C with a customized compiler on specialized hardware. Important for max frame rate on vehicle inference computer.  Otherwise; we mostly use C++ &amp; Python.
1,@Kristennetten While it is tempting to focus on one of those arenas as the “hard one”; in fact they are all difficult &amp; important. Tight C &amp; custom compiler too.  An inference computer optimized for energy efficiency; reliability &amp; long life is also critical. Can’t just jam GPUs in the trunk.
1,@tesletter @Kristennetten Definitely
1,@Kristennetten A general solution to self-driving (essentially; real-world AI) requires writing extremely difficult software in the arenas of training; inference; control; analytical tools; data management; hardware optimization &amp; simulation.  One of the hardest technology problems that exists.
1,@gdb Compilers can be way better too. Not enough effort spent there.

1,@GuiStroz @JohnnaCrider1 True; careless negativity (destruction) is much harder than thoughtful positivity (creation)
1,@stevenmarkryan Sadly true
1,@JohnnaCrider1 That’s true to some degree; but citizen podcasts that aren’t negative like Rogan; Fridman; Dodd; TED interviews; etc are very popular.   Maybe part of why traditional media outlets are so negative is because old habits die hard? They so rarely even try to be positive.
1,@slashdot Not needed

1,@AaronS5_ @ashleevance 2021 has been the year of super crazy supply chain shortages; so it wouldn’t matter if we had 17 new products; as none would ship.   Assuming 2022 is not mega drama; new Roadster should ship in 2023.
1,@PPathole I mostly run alpha software in my car; which is not meant for public consumption. A few days before release; I switch my car to what public will experience.

1,@GermanyDiplo So you’re actually proud of it. Interesting. Frankly; I doubt that a majority of the German public supports this. Have you run a poll?  Surely it is a violation of the sovereignty of Italy for Germany to transport vast numbers of illegal immigrants to Italian soil?   Has invasion

1,@disclosetv What could go wrong?

1,@UpdatingOnRome Same 🔥
1,@MatchasmMatt Great story
1,@ggreenwald Don’t want to blow their minds; but there is a slight possibility that not everything is Russian disinformation
1,@UpdatingOnRome I sometimes wonder if perhaps Rome was started by exiles from Troy. It’s not completely out of the question.   At some point in antiquity; a few ships of very competent soldiers (with almost no women) landed on the coast of Italy. Where did they come from?
1,@garrytan There is no question at this point that they have failed very badly; so they need to go

1,@cb_doge The name was suggested by an advertising agency; but my fault for accepting it.   It is very confusing; as the URL could be zip2; ziptwo; zipto or ziptoo.

1,@KonstantinKisin Most people (maybe all?) are instinctively moral relativists.  If you’re perceived as being in the group; you can do no wrong; whereas those outside the group can do no right.  This instinct can be overridden; but requires a strong commitment to truth over convenience.

1,@SawyerMerritt @Tesla Cool
1,@krassenstein The vast majority of people just plain forget their safe combination; so should allow Liberty to open it.   Beats using a plasma cutter; potentially damaging what’s inside and having to buy a new safe.  I don’t have a safe. Nothing particularly worth stealing.

1,@KanekoaTheGreat Really 85% of terrorist plots were substantially driven by the FBI? Are we sure about that?
1,@KanekoaTheGreat @ggreenwald Accurate.   By veering into being a far left activist organization; the ADL is undermining its core mission of fighting anti-Semitism.

Compressibility drag is lower there than at 0.95.  Air density drops exponentially with altitude; whereas speed-based drag is merely a square. https://t.co/42HlNCxTxk

1,@shellenberger @ADL True
1,@shellenberger Exactly
1,Exactly
1,@greg_price11 Because the answer is “Yes!” regarding seeking donations; hence JG’s refusal to answer the question.   JG instead went on the attack; implying that Sorkin; despite being Jewish; is somehow an anti-Semite just for asking a basic conflict-of-interest question! 🤣
1,@cb_doge I think these will shift a lot in the years to come
1,@Scobleizer People should use lists a lot more. We’re making them much easier to create; discover and use.
1,@Scobleizer Absolutely
1,@stclairashley Exactly! The ADL is extremely powerful in the west; as demonstrated by our massive drop in US advertising; while Asia advertising has actually grown slightly.
1,@monitoringbias Fate loves irony next-level
1,@fentasyl Does seem strange. Why does the FBI need training that holocausts are terrible? I don’t think they should hire agents where this is a question mark!
1,Jonathan at ADL kicked off a massive Twitter boycott campaign less than a week after the acquisition closed.   Literally nothing had changed about the site.   Our US revenue is still 60% down from that campaign; but slowly improving. https://t.co/7vh5dtdDqi
1,@micsolana This seems dubious
1,@stclairashley Trying “1234” might work too
1,@stclairashley This is the classic “lost my password” issue; but for safes. People forget their safe combinations all the time and then call the safe company to open it.
1,@shellenberger Very concerning
1,@alx The questions asked by the interviewers were excellent.   However; JG was obviously disingenuous with his answers and took every opportunity to stoke fear.
1,@nikitabier I’ve been to the Hamptons a few times and maybe I’m missing something; but it was pretty slow – not a lot happening

1,@farzyness @WalterIsaacson Managing that data is extremely difficult. We ignore (don’t store at all) or delete almost all of it.   The training videos that matter are rare ones; like weird &amp; busy intersections; so less than 1% of all videos.   Tesla is limited by AI training compute. Nvidia + Dojo fix it.

1,@teslaownersSV @DrKnowItAll16 @alx Advertisers avoid controversy; so all that is needed for ADL to crush our US &amp; European ad revenue is to make unfounded accusations. They have much less power in Asia; so our ad revenue there is still strong.  This “controversy” causes advertisers to “pause”; but that pause is
1,@libsoftiktok That’s for sure.   Might take until next week; as we’re short-staffed this week.
1,@WholeMarsBlog True
1,@cb_doge That’s the goal
1,@DrKnowItAll16 @alx Based on what we’ve heard from advertisers; ADL seems to be responsible for most of our revenue loss.   Giving them maximum benefit of the doubt; I don’t see any scenario where they’re responsible for less than 10% of the value destruction; so ~$4 billion.  Document discovery of
1,@libsoftiktok Great point. A giant data dump would clear the air.
1,@alx Interesting.   In our case; they would potentially be on the hook for destroying half the value of the company; so roughly $22 billion.
1,@SawyerMerritt Beware any company where leadership compensation is not linked to performance

1,@davidmdraiman Despite the immense harm ADL has done to X/Twitter; they still will not be banned in this platform; unless they break the law
1,@stclairashley @libsoftiktok @ChayaRaichik10 ADL has pushed hard for us to shut down accounts like Chaya’s; even though it has nothing to do with anti-Semitism; which is their supposed charter!
1,@cb_doge @ADL Yeah
1,@MarioNawfal Exactly
1,@KeithWoodsYT In general; permanent bans will be rare going forward. That is necessary for this platform to be the public square.   I also agree that the ADL should make their explicit demands public. In my opinion; they are excessive; but perhaps the public will agree with them.
1,@ID_AA_Carmack It is oddly hard to figure out where the beep is coming from
1,@WallStreetSilv Yeah
1,@xDaily Exactly.   We no longer need to restore US advertising to prior levels for survival.   That said; it would be nice to see it return.
1,@krassenstein Thanks!
1,@teslaownersSV @imPenny2x @ADL If this continues; we will have no choice but to file a defamation suit against; ironically; the “Anti-Defamation” League.  If they lose the defamation suit; we will insist that they drop the the “anti” part of their name; since obviously … 😂
1,@imPenny2x @ADL Our US advertising revenue is still down 60%; primarily due to pressure on advertisers by @ADL (that’s what advertisers tell us); so they almost succeeded in killing X/Twitter!
1,@imPenny2x Since the acquisition; The @ADL has been trying to kill this platform by falsely accusing it &amp; me of being anti-Semitic

1,@krassenstein Agreed on all.   We’re changing polls to allow votes only by verified users. That’s critical to avoid polls getting bot-spammed on controversial issues.  The ADL has done a lot of good work in prior decades; but has been overzealous in recent years &amp; hijacked by woke mind virus.

1,@thackerpd @JudiciaryGOP @MikeBenzCyber @mtaibbi @davidzweig @DrJBhattacharya He should tell it to the judge/jury. When his donors get deposed and there is full document discovery; this guy will sing a very different tune.  Sunlight is the best disinfectant.
1,@alx It’s almost like they have an axe to grind 😂
1,Cool
1,Aiming for 10 Falcon flights in a month by end of this year; then 12 per month next year
1,@BillyM2k Sorry; this should be more stable over time. Revenue share is still very much beta code.  Worth noting that only verified users (aka X Premium subscribers) count for ad revenue; otherwise it’s trivial to game.
1,Great work by the @SpaceX team successfully launching 61 Falcon rocket missions this year!   If tomorrow’s mission goes well; we will exceed last year’s flight count.   SpaceX has delivered ~80% of all Earth payload mass to orbit in 2023. China is ~10% &amp; rest of world other ~10%.

1,@Austen The media lies constantly. Explicit lies are easy to catch; compared to the choice-of-narrative lie.   They completely ignore that which they don’t want to talk about; but will turn a molehill into a mountain when they do want to talk about it.

I say this even though Dragon uses LiDAR for docking with Station; so I don’t intrinsically hate that technology.
1,@ray4tesla Some of them are indeed doing so – we’re well aware.  Part of the value of having our own hardware is that our software will only run on that specific hardware; warts &amp; all.  As with Apple; you can’t just copy the code or unpack the binaries. You need their hardware too.

1,@farzyness Having a vast fleet of cars for FSD Autopilot training is a massive Tesla advantage. Essential for the hundreds of millions of unusual situations cars encounter on roads every year.
1,@WholeMarsBlog HW4 software will lag HW3 by at least another six months; as our focus needs to be on getting FSD on HW3 working super well and provided internationally.
1,@WholeMarsBlog Designing in the cameras; liquid-cooled Tesla computer (always go liquid-cooled!) and high security internet gateway will probably take major car companies about three years.  Might as well start now! We want to be helpful; as we were with making our patents available for free;
1,@ianzelbo People send me LinkedIn links sometimes; but the cringe level is so high that I just can’t bring myself to use it; so I ask for the resume or bio to be emailed.  We will make sure that the X competitor to LinkedIn is cool.
1,@DrAseemMalhotra On balance; we are far better to have modern medicine than not; but there have been some egregious situations; like opioids.  Some of my friends were seriously hurt by this and are now lost to the world.  No question that we need to have stronger accountability.
1,@aelluswamy True; it was super hard to do this!  Even when FSD is 2X as safe as the average human driver fully unsupervised in all scenarios; then we will want to make it 3X; 4X … 10X.  About a million people die every year in automotive accidents and ~10 million are seriously injured.
1,@WholeMarsBlog Yeah
1,@thejefflutz @CNBC @business @YahooFinance @Tesla They don’t get it
1,@dogeofficialceo Is Klaus on X himself? We should DM lol.
1,@dawsonbeggs @ilyamiskov Moving to medium opacity circles around buttons when scrolling down; full opacity bar (matching top) when scrolling scrolling up
1,@astro_greek Sure feels like it sometimes
1,@imPenny2x Douglas Adams is my favorite philosopher
1,@griptmedia @Ben_Scallan When is the next election in Ireland?
1,@disclosetv This is concerning; as the temptation for governments to engage in political censorship is almost impossible for them to avoid
1,@lexfridman @realGeorgeHotz Sure is
1,@stats_feed Impressive
1,@Teslaconomics He’s such a jolly little fellow
1,@garrytan They want war? Let’s give it to them. We cannot let these snakes win or San Francisco will end up like Detroit.  The clincher was discovering that this is actually just a tax write off for Latham; not actually “pro bono” at all.
1,I just can’t … roflmao … the irony is too much 🤣🤣
1,DOJ needs to sue themselves!
1,@astro_greek Only had one “powerful” (extremely puny by today’s standards) computer in the beginning; so our system would only work during the day; because I was coding &amp; compiling at night
1,@LibertyCappy Great idea 😂
1,@WholeMarsBlog There is a lot of merit to having your own chip design. We optimize its usage down to the microsecond.
1,@Teslaconomics It is very easy!  11.4.7; which is mostly; but not entirely; AI is with Tesla employees and a few external users. Rolls out to anyone who bought FSD in the North America next week.
1,@BasedBeffJezos Ironically; Meta is doing what I meant “Open” AI to do
1,@cb_doge Perhaps one enchanted evening we will find each other …
1,@micsolana Yeah
1,@durreadan01 The use efficiency (single tap vs scroll up plus tap) exceeds the esthetic penalty. However; I think we should make each button separate; like the post (+) button; rather than have a translucent bar.
1,@mezaoptimizer Not that it’s much consolation; but the energy efficiency of LLMs using auto-regressive transformers is extremely bad; not just in training; but also inference.  I think it’s off by several orders of magnitude.
1,Starlink antennas use an internally developed; electronically steered phased array tight beam that is more advanced than the best military technology
1,@cb_doge Yeah
1,@bindureddy I love the Midjourney art
1,@DillonLoomis22 Vision does require solving real world AI; which is hard; but vision is fundamentally superior to lidar
1,@mayanicks0x @krassenstein Our goal is to be the platform of the people; to restore power to the people; to those want to know the truth
1,@krassenstein Thank you and; yes; absolutely true
1,@treb5475 Mostly correct transcript
1,@stevenmarkryan Yeah. I’ve been working on this for 8 years and still the results of end-to-end; pure video AI blow my mind!
1,I recommend strongly recommend posting your podcast on X. It’s easy and will get incredible distribution!
1,@farzyness Solving real-world AI has been an unbelievably hard problem
1,The Crew-7 mission for @NASA is in orbit; on its way to @Space_Station!
1,@alexchaomander @Scobleizer In my opinion; one  and it isn’t LLM’s using auto-regressive transformers
1,@Scobleizer An accurate assessment.  What is also mindblowing is that the inference compute power needed for 8 cameras running at 36FPS is only about 100W on the Tesla-designed AI computer. This puny amount of power is enough to achieve superhuman driving!  It makes a big difference that we
1,@SmokeAwayyy Reminds me of the Post Ranch Inn
1,@cb_doge He’s such a chicken 🤣
1,@DrJBhattacharya Who at Santa Clara County broke the law? I think we know.
1,@WholeMarsBlog Right now it’s too boring. I’m just on the 280.
1,@cb_doge Traditional media is just way too slow
1,@alx People are clearly interested in hearing from Trump. One may not agree with the man; but he is never boring!
1,@cb_doge Fox should put their shows on X
1,@JonErlichman Big swings; but ultimately very much upward
1,@lindayaX @NFL @X X is the best place to follow sports; because you get so much great commentary in real-time
1,@jasondebolt Yeah
1,@BillyM2k A bold suggestion; but perhaps we should try it!
1,@LibertyCappy Guess I’m pretty old 🤣
1,@mayemusk @SpaceX @POTUS @CivilRights Exactly. It’s insane.
1,@garrytan Let’s ask our companies to cease all work with @lathamwatkins
1,@auweia1 @nheyman @AbbyNormalSF @CommonSenseiSF @TheCoalitionSF @sfgov @DavidChiu @LondonBreed @lathamwatkins @garrytan Interesting; so not really pro bono

1,@DavidSacks This is getting ridiculous
1,@realDonaldTrump Approximately 10 million views per hour of this image

1,@adamdangelo Sigh
1,@ZubyMusic Yeah
1,@ThierryBreton @EU_Commission @DigitalEU We are working hard on this
1,The speed at which your message on this platform can reach a vast number of people is mind-blowing
1,@shellenberger Extremely concerning
1,@telmudic True
1,@MattWalshBlog That would have been the right move
1,@MattWalshBlog True
1,@VivekGRamaswamy @TheAtlantic @CNN @joerogan The Atlantic; like many publications; once wrote great material; but has now devolved into a tedious propaganda pusher.   They could at least not bore us all to death in the process!
1,@Austen Great questions
1,@alx Accurate
1,@lulumeservey True
1,@JTLonsdale The weaponization of government agencies needs to stop. This fundamentally undermines public faith in the justice system.
1,@gurgavin The fundamental principle of ITAR law is that US companies who have advanced weapons technology; such as rockets with intercontinental range; must hire people who are permanent American residents; so that the technology does not fall into the hands of countries who wish us harm.
1,@gurgavin Exactly
1,@cb_doge Threadzzz 😴
1,@WholeMarsBlog Tomorrow around 4pm PT
1,@mualphaxi And she is anti-Semitic

1,@xDaily @SawyerMerritt The bot wars continue
1,Next-level
1,@RichardHanania Exactly
1,@lrocket Exactly.   SpaceX was told repeatedly that hiring anyone who was not a permanent resident of the United States would violate international arms trafficking law; which would be a criminal offense.  We couldn’t even hire Canadian citizens; despite Canada being part of NORAD!  This
1,@cb_doge Yeah!
1,@garrytan People have had enough. Time for major change in SF. We can’t let this beautiful city die.
1,@ZubyMusic Yeah
1,@DirtyTesLa Maybe I can squeeze it in tomorrow night
1,@andst7 Ancient Rome was very colorful
1,@stclairashley He was impressive
1,@cb_doge I tried using TikTok and felt their AI probing my brain; so I stopped
1,@jordanbpeterson @TorontoStar If you take the “sensitivity training” course and explain live why it is nonsense; that would be quite funny
1,@bariweiss @TimJDillon Edgy move. Definitely won’t be boring.
1,@cb_doge For sure
1,@sfstandard @LondonBreed The mayor is right
1,@AutismCapital Might reach a quarter billion views at this rate
1,@ZubyMusic Or at least be required to pass some basic cognitive tests
1,@VivekGRamaswamy It is possibly overstated in the short term; but we should be concerned about it long term.  Moving billions of tons of carbon from deep underground into the atmosphere and oceans will have an effect.
1,@cb_doge The reach of this platform is insane
1,@WSBChairman I think we know those names
1,@MattWalshBlog They should be prosecuted if there is any justice in this world
1,@dogeofficialceo Based
1,@medicgordus @justinbwells Good point
1,@cb_doge That’s what I do
1,@krassenstein Vivek is increasingly compelling
1,@alx @realDonaldTrump Whether one agrees with him or not; he has written some of the funniest posts ever on this platform
1,@TuckerCarlson Interesting to hear things directly vs through the media filter
1,Interview with @realDonaldTrump
1,@TimSweeneyEpic This sounds pretty cool.   I am a little concerned about consolidation of video games companies leading to less adventurous work being done.
1,@eldsjal I have overcome the desire to be liked 🤣
1,@arctechinc When we are ready to do so; we will.   While I think it is our best product ever; it is an extremely difficult product to build. We are in uncharted territory; because it is not like anything else.
1,@astro_greek I’m trying to set a good example. We can’t let humanity disappear!
1,@itsALLrisky My brother is an amazing chef; but I am definitely not
1,@rookisaacman @MarioNawfal Longer than I expected.  Slight chance this is a psy op.
1,@Teslaconomics It is in the set of possible outcome. I see a path.
1,@NFT_GOD @xDaily Just have it return the same value every time
1,@billmaher @VivekGRamaswamy Ren Fairs are great
1,@teslaownersSV It’s true
1,@astro_greek I would just move my desk around the factory to wherever the biggest problem was.  These days; I don’t have a desk; but the room I use for meetings at HQ overlooks the Model Y end of line.
1,@cb_doge And yet they demand that the public pay to subscribe to them. What hypocrites!
1,Exactly.   X will be filing legal action to stop this. Can’t wait for discovery to start!
1,@sundarpichai @isro Super cool!
1,@micsolana @Techgnostik @IKchmt6jSYhp5I8 That does seem to be the case
1,@micsolana Definitely would be some great meme material
1,Our advertising revenue share program also applies to organizations (news or otherwise) who wish to participate
1,Interesting
1,@tunguz People should be more chill about words online. Don’t take it personally if the person doesn’t know you personally.
1,@CocaCola I would just like to thank the genius who came up with Diet Coke. Best drink ever.  Coke Zero is a way better name; but I like the taste of Diet Coke slightly more.
1,@cb_doge I think this is our best product ever
1,@isro Congratulations India 🇮🇳!!
1,@SirineAti @cb_doge But then I told the team it didn’t actually need to be so pointy and they wanted to keep it that way!

1,@EvaVlaar Nothing. People have had enough.
1,@mayemusk X is a dog &amp; Doge friendly place!
1,@KettlebellLife I didn’t know that. Message to the future.
1,@stillgray I agree
1,@xDaily A trillion dollar market cap for this platform is not out of the question
1,@esherifftv True 😂  Biggest rocket of all time by far and the first design capable of colonizing Mars; but public awareness is ironically tiny.
1,@_sebastianFay @BecomingCritter Video games have had by far the best original content for the past 30+ years
1,@JonErlichman Almost like there’s a trend
1,@cb_doge I look forward to it!
1,@WholeMarsBlog I appreciate the note. Frankly; negative feedback is good. Keeps ego in check.   https://t.co/iVRzvuATLb
1,@cb_doge Same
1,We’re being super careful with Notes to maximize accuracy.   Everything is open source and criticism is always welcome.
1,Next Starship launch soon
1,Facebook is manipulating the public almost everywhere on Earth.   That is why they won’t open source their algorithm.
1,@tunguz That would be great
1,@teslaownersSV Tesla Model S Plaid will do 0 to 60mph (~100km/h) in 2 seconds
1,@LibertyCappy Accurate
1,@stclairashley If the bubonic plague comes back; sure; but not for a cold
1,@stillgray Tragic that Ronan Farrow is a puppet of the establishment and against the people
1,@PrinceVogel He is now in logo heaven
1,@KettlebellLife Even liver flavor?
1,@cb_doge Charming
1,@stclairashley Troll level 9000
1,@cb_doge Finally having truth in advertising is awesome
1,@DanielleFong @jimkxa At the end the day; we just need resilient logic gates; so maybe there is a way to get 1000x volumetrically?
1,@jimkxa @DanielleFong Can you elaborate on how to achieve 1000x? At this point; we should just count the atoms; rather than say “2nm”.   Obviously; 2nm is just a marketing term; not the actual metal width; which is more like 20nm.  But 1000x would still be smaller than the size of a carbon atom; if
1,@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Wow; 4 years
1,@McGradyCyber Exactly
1,@DirtyTesLa We’re transitioning
1,True!
1,@alx His humorous posts are great
1,@stevenmarkryan It is unfortunately trending that way for many automakers. Some companies do understand; but their pace of change is nonetheless slow.  Tesla is trying to be as helpful to other carmakers as possible with the transition to autonomous electric vehicles: we open source our patents;
1,@xDaily Should there even be a limit?
1,@Newsthink Good for India 🇮🇳!
1,@cb_doge User-seconds is the most rigorous measure of usage
1,@cb_doge Great question. We need to get a move on with Starship!
1,@xDaily This is coming from me directly. Will greatly improve the esthetics.
1,@cb_doge @ehikian Agreed. We will make that change across the board. It’s too long in the profile section too.
1,@Culture_Crit It is amazing
1,@imPenny2x Tweep is the word you get when you combine twerp and creep
1,@gdb We should have a humbleness competition!
1,If you’re a journalist who wants more freedom to write and a higher income; then publish directly on this platform!
1,@cb_doge *Highest (sigh)
1,@cb_doge We exceeded 346 billion user-seconds today. Highway usage ever; apart from a spike a few months ago where multiple LLM companies tried to download our entire database simultaneously.  Surprised to see that Mashable still exists.
1,@garrytan What does the @ACLU say about this?
1,@DrKnowItAll16 Do video games or movies have time? They just have frames.   When those frames are shown at human comprehension speed; they appear to be continuous; but they are not.   The reality that we are in is bounded by Planck-time.
1,@phloemis @DirtyTesLa “Tweepcred”; possibly the worst product name I’ve ever heard; will be deleted. Not simply renamed. Deleted.
1,@garrytan Ironically; if it were retitled a study about irony; it would be a study about honesty

1,@APompliano I’d like to see pics of the QA team; if they’re still alive
1,@PrinceVogel One of the things that surprised me most was how many people simply read this platform and never post or like.   They may DM; bookmark or forward a post; but are reticent to do anything public.  The ratio is shockingly high; as you point out. I hope more people participate.
1,@krassenstein Yes; the obvious move is to strengthen the mute function by making anything posted by the muted account invisible to you. Right now; both mute and block are partly broken.  It should also be made easy to continue to follow an account; while blocking their ability to DM you.
1,@spacesudoer @TeslaSynopsis @teslaownersSV @EvaFoxU @dvorahfr @Kristennetten @imPenny2x @JaneidyEve @SirineAti @kerrikgray That BBC reporter obviously had no idea what he was saying; but someone told him to make those false claims.   The question is who.
1,@cb_doge Pretty much
1,@Culture_Crit Strange that everyone except small children was expected to wear a hat
1,@WholeMarsBlog Yeah
1,@imPenny2x Weaponize apathy and see if anyone cares
1,@EdKrassen Mute needs to mute properly; including all mentions. Block will only apply to DMs. @Jack gets it. Surprisingly few others do.
1,@adamdangelo True. I hope it’s nice to us humans.
1,Pretty fun blocking people who complain that blocking is going away.   How does the medicine taste? 😂😂
1,@OwenSparks_ True
1,@imPenny2x @FamilyofP I’m having a good time blocking people who complain that blocking is going away 😂
1,@RealJamesWoods Then delete your account
1,@Noahpinion Humanity’s birth rate is collapsing
1,@ylecun Human population is collapsing
1,The sad truth is that there are no great “social networks” right now.  We may fail; as so many have predicted; but we will try our best to make there be at least one.
1,@stclairashley It’s great
1,@stillgray Fair description
1,@MattWalshBlog It will be better. Watch.
1,@stillgray That pattern is common
1,@teslaownersSV Legacy media algorithm:  1. Read X 2. Print it out 3. Go to 1
1,@stevenmarkryan Precisely
1,@stillgray Correct; only verified users count
1,@alex_avoigt The hardware is actually extremely difficult
1,@cb_doge Seriously
1,@kennyle31 @LauraLoomer @XCreators That is also a factor
1,@jack @teslaownersSV Jack understands
1,@stillgray Seriously
1,@DavidSacks Really?
1,@teslaownersSV @CommunityNotes True; however that note is incorrect and the community already voted it away
1,@LauraLoomer @RonDeSantis @krassenstein @EdKrassen @stillgray Find advertisers who support you. We cannot force them to.
1,@PrinceVogel Good idea
1,@cstanley Absolutely
1,@Chad_Hurley We might be
1,@cstanley It will be the only way
1,Although there are some bad things in the world; remember that there are many good things too
1,@JohnnaCrider1 The @tacobell breakfast crunch wrap with extra hot sauce is amazing

1,@enriquebrgn @AqueelMiq Exactly
1,@Jason Seems messed up
1,@lexfridman Haha 💯
1,@alx Now that would be interesting
1,@manumazzanti @Erdayastronaut Hopefully; it works
1,Interstage extension for hot gas venting added to enable Starship to turn on its engines while booster engines still firing!

1,@ishotasegod @EndWokeness That is both funny &amp; tragic in its accuracy.   The “New York” Times is a declining; once-powerful; but fundamentally doomed to be regional &amp; increasingly archaic legacy publication.
1,@teslaownersSV It makes no sense
1,@teslaownersSV Block is going to be deleted as a “feature”; except for DMs

1,@imPenny2x Now; more than ever
1,@alx Sorry it’s taking so long. There are so many layers of “trust &amp; safety” software that it often takes us hours to figure out who; how and why an account was suspended or shadowbanned.   A ground up rewrite is underway that simplifies the X codebase dramatically.

1,@neontaster “Rolling Stone@ is just a logo at this point. Nothing remains of what it used to be.
1,@cb_doge @Apple Phone demand is flattening out; as there just isn’t much more you can do with a black rectangle.  That means most of Apple’s market cap will be in that 30% fee; if it isn’t already there on an NPV basis.  Even though 30% is obviously too high; it will have to be taken from them

1,@WallStreetSilv He is right that AI could be a great teacher; but it matters immensely how an AI is “fine-tuned”
1,Immersive video on X is starting to get good. Just swipe up for next video.
1,@tunguz Most large AI systems are currently extremely wasteful with how much energy is spent on data transfer (moving same bits around) vs compute.  Tesla estimate is that at least an order of magnitude improvement is possible.

1,Great analysis of @CommunityNotes by @VitalikButerin
1,@ID_AA_Carmack @ketogrillbakery Assuming ~0.5c is the resultant speed of the superheated plasma that remains of whoever got punched; simply attempting to transfer that much kinetic energy so fast would be comparable to a large thermonuclear explosion.

1,@cb_doge @lexfridman We got some cupcakes for Lex’s birthday
1,@BasedBeffJezos And it’s made of cake. Always has been.
1,Fight Recap:  I joked on X about fighting Zuck  Zuck then said “SEND ME LOCATION”   Italy graciously offered a Colosseum  Zuck declined  I suggested his home as “safe space”  Tragically; he was ahem “traveling”  Is there anywhere he will fight?   https://t.co/gpcRLW49fv
1,@alx Ask about his opinion on poultry
1,@WalterIsaacson That is the biggest question
1,@john Cool
1,@CathieDWood Interesting
1,@tibo_maker Anything you think you should change?
1,@xDaily Accurate
1,@alx I can’t tell what’s real these day 😂  Can someone please let him know on 🧵that I’m popping by his house to fight as soon as he’s “back in town”.
1,@dogeofficialceo Toffee Crisp 😋
1,@krassenstein Yeah.  Also; civil war isn’t very civil.
1,@PicturesFoIder Mosquitoes that carry malaria
1,@eldsjal 6 hours works for me. Less than that and my brain is in pain
1,@bassel_amin @cb_doge I care very much
1,@WholeMarsBlog I wonder why
1,@GailAlfarATX True
1,@Scobleizer When we properly apply AI to X; the content recommendations; about AI and everything else; will be incredible
1,@xDaily The cracks &amp; scratches better represent this product that I love
1,@andst7 Accurate
1,@cb_doge Exactly 😂😂
1,@WholeMarsBlog That how humans work. It’s rather obvious; imo; that you need real-world AI (digital neural nets) and cameras to solve for a road system that is designed for biological neural nets and eyes.
1,@cb_doge He would have to let that sink in!
1,@cb_doge There was some hasty bag packing at the  Zuckerberg residence today! Traveling my ass.
1,(Zuck thread coming soon about how he would of course love to fight anytime; but blah blah UFC something something)
1,@ashleevance A lot 🤣
1,@WholeMarsBlog Tesla FSD test; X Livestream test &amp; attempted Zuck fight triple header!!!
1,@dogeofficialceo Hey @growing_daniel; no offense; but is that you?
1,@GailAlfarATX I barely ever read them.   Mainstream media is a misery magnifier.
1,For the Tesla FSD test drive in Palo Alto tonight; I will ask the car to drive to @finkd’s house.  Will also test latest X livestream video; so you can monitor our adventure in real-time!  If we get lucky and Zuck my 👅 actually answers the door; the fight is on!
1,@dogeofficialceo Knock knock Who’s there? Knutsēk Nutsack who? Knutsēk Tæbag
1,Thought you might want some tea; so I brought the bags
1,Knock; knock … challenge accepted … open the door @finkd
1,@paulg Yeah
1,@lexfridman Elden Ring if solo; Diablo if co-op. Haven’t played BG3; but heard it’s great.
1,@tszzl Need to finish the job
1,The die is cast https://t.co/QNcefBA8EO
1,@cb_doge Yeah
1,@alx Can’t wait to bang on his door tomorrow 🤣
1,@TheBronxViking @unusual_whales Love that movie
1,@WholeMarsBlog He can’t eat at chic fil a because that would be cannibalism
1,@xDaily I’m gonna bang on his door tomorrow and demand to fight
1,@stclairashley Zuck is a chicken
1,@cb_doge @WalterIsaacson This is the full message: https://t.co/UzbKoIkFOc
1,@DavidSacks @AMercouris Accurate
1,@dogeofficialceo Never 👀
1,@powerbottomdad1 California has a lot going for it
1,@teslaownersSV Such a great country and people!
1,@GRDecter Yikes
1,@farzyness They really are
1,@baldursgate3 Heard good things
1,@WholeMarsBlog @bindureddy Tell me about it
1,@mipateluk @tunguz DNA GitHub
1,@WholeMarsBlog People in SF are having sex?
1,Practicing martial arts with my sparring partner https://t.co/bifsH2Mejs
1,@OwenSparks_ Art too incredible for words
1,@xDaily Or we could do both and consider next week just a practice session
1,@xDaily Otherwise; we will do it as soon as the arena in Italy is ready
1,@xDaily If Zuck my 👅 really wants a lesson in why there are weight categories in fighting so badly; I could just head over to his house next week and teach him a lesson he won’t soon forget
1,@MatthewDR @Tesla Tesla shorts sure are gluttons for punishment! I mean; how many times do they want to do this!?
1,@ggcollignon 🇲🇽 Mexico rocks! 🇲🇽
1,And pediatric hospitals in Italy
1,@shellenberger Awesome!
1,@WholeMarsBlog Been lifting hard almost every day. Need to be able to do an overhead press of ~155lbs …
1,@stillgray @ACOLExyz @cb_doge I’m going for the @WWE overhead body slam smack down
1,@ACOLExyz @cb_doge If the size difference is big enough; this is absolutely true. No way lil X is putting me in a choke hold no matter how skilled he is lol.
1,@VivekGRamaswamy Who did the poll?
1,@garrytan Absolutely
1,Our goal is to make this the best platform for creators around the world!
1,@MarcusHouse Falcon 9 looks cute next to Starship and Falcon 1 looks like a high school project
1,@stclairashley I love the night
1,@monitoringbias In fairness; he does demonstrate that people of any race can be extremely stupid
1,‘Who controls the memes; controls the universe’ – Frank “The Tank” Herbert
1,@cremieuxrecueil Yeah
1,@tunguz Yeah
1,Estne volumen in toga; an solum tibi libet me videre?
1,@cb_doge Both video &amp; just audio
1,@DustinStockton Are you sure?
1,@cb_doge Yup; and across iOS; Android; Windows; Linux &amp; Mac
1,@jimfarley98 @LivShaka It is a great community
1,And all proceeds go to veterans
1,@cb_doge I spent 3 hours in an MRI machine on Monday. Bottom line is that my C5/C6 fusion is solid; so not an issue.   However; there is a problem with my right shoulder blade rubbing against my ribs; which requires minor surgery. Recovery will only take a few months.
1,Everything done will pay respect to the past and present of Italy
1,@growing_daniel Can we at least know how they will spend American tax dollars?   I don’t mind some corruption; but it would be nice to know roughly how many pennies on the dollar are making it to the average person in Ukraine.
1,@EvaFoxU @lindayaX I’m working on engineering; design &amp; server operations; which is what I like to do
1,@dogeofficialceo This is the funniest place on the Internet!
1,@krassenstein Absolutely!
1,@TheChiefNerd Technically; lawful; but (depending on your perspective) awful; content can be shared; but it will not be recommended to users in For You
1,The fight will be managed by my and Zuck’s foundations (not UFC).  Livestream will be on this platform and Meta. Everything in camera frame will be ancient Rome; so nothing modern at all.  I spoke to the PM of Italy and Minister of Culture. They have agreed on an epic location.
1,@cb_doge @lindayaX True
1,@astro_greek Am getting into better shape
1,@WholeMarsBlog You mean 11.4.7? That should be going to wide release within a week.   Version 12; which an almost total rewrite (~99% AI) is being tested by our QA drivers.   Too much new code to go to the public yet; but it is mind-blowing imo.
1,@Rainmaker1973 Those bastards even get me through my jeans!
1,@Neuro_Skeptic I love video games
1,@alx Agreed
1,@sama Time is a construct of human perception
1,@Rainmaker1973 Reminds me of Diablo
1,@xDaily They’re used to a pace of innovation that is slower than continental drift.  Welcome to the fast lane!
1,@Rainmaker1973 That’s strange
1,@benshapiro I think the solution here is to price so-called “safe” advertising higher than “unsafe”.   My companies will happily buy the latter.
1,@all_in_tok @DavidSacks @theallinpod Even Stalin couldn’t take Finland in the Winter War. When the entire local population is against you; winning is extremely difficult.
1,@teslaownersSV 🤔 dunno
1,@stevenmarkryan The future is gonna be wild
1,@DirtyTesLa No problem to farm away; so long as you’re posting interesting or funny material
1,@Teslaconomics A lot of people met or at least got to know someone on this platform.  If you like their posts; good chance you’ll like the person too.
1,@Jason Don’t forget to enjoy the ups; even though there will be downs; otherwise what’s the point of having ups?
1,@waitbutwhy Honey is neither animal; plant or fungus
1,@cb_doge But they have to be verified users or it is trivial to scam
1,@xDaily Cool feature for subscribers
1,This essentially means that X Premium (fka Twitter Blue) is free for accounts that generate above 5M views.   Note; only views from verified handles count; as scammers will otherwise use bots to spam views to infinity.
1,@oshea @X We need to hustle and get our recruiting product available at scale!
1,This platform is by far the best way to reach world leaders; CEOs and the cognoscenti in general
1,@DustinStockton @SenatorBennet The crazy thing is that we are the only ones to open source our algorithm and on X it is the community that does (great) fact-checking; including on advertisers and me!
1,Great product engineering &amp; design sessions today with the 𝕏 team!  Future is looking bright.
1,@JonErlichman Interesting
1,@SawyerMerritt I pretty much just use (Recommended) For You
1,@FredLohner Nice
1,Highly recommend doing this!
1,@krassenstein @EdKrassen @KrassenCast Cool!
1,@thesimple_sarah @Tesla @tesla_na Cool
1,@heyitsyashu Reuters and facts are not well acquainted
1,@stillgray Damn
1,@growing_daniel This is happening in many major US cities
1,@Authority_AI I used history podcasts on a timer to fall asleep!
1,@ChrisJBakke So cringe 😂
1,Highly recommend “The Explorers” podcast for stories of exploration of many cultures over the ages.   Am currently learning about Ibn Battuta; an amazingly widely traveled Islamic explorer.
1,@Teslaconomics Wise words
1,@MuskUniversity Absolutely. I’m calling out NY Times &amp; ADL in particular.
1,@stclairashley Sam Harris has gone flat out insane. It’s tragic.
1,@greg_price11 @MrAndyNgo Who was the lawyer?
1,@Noahpinion This is crazy. We need them!
1,@AiBreakfast Interesting
1,@AutismCapital Making parody memes of the current thing
1,@KanekoaTheGreat @VivekGRamaswamy He has a great point
1,@RichardDawkins Many parallels
1,@TexasLindsay_ True
1,@SherrodBrown “Experts at CNN” 🤣🤣
1,@SethDillon I’m saying that a moral civilization (where trust is relatively high among citizens) will outcompete an immoral one.
1,@WSBChairman Looks like we might just survive after all
1,@cb_doge Not a super high bar these days; as SNL has become so woke
1,@RichardHanania Not exactly subtle. It is unequivocally a genocide song!
1,@xDaily This is important and fair to advertisers. They don’t have a right to censor this platform; but they absolutely do have a right to say what content appears next to their ads.   That said; I would recommend advertisers not be super concerned about content adjacency. Tesla and
1,@SaraHigdon_ @EdKrassen That is tampering with the jury and deeply messed up. Let’s see how the appeal goes.
1,@JackBox When we were building our first company; my brother &amp; I ate dinner at the Jack in the Box on El Camino every night! @kimbal
1,@stevenmarkryan Just the fact that the media chooses what to write about and what to ignore means you are essentially *always* being misled
1,@cb_doge Liking my own post liking my own post 😂
1,@EdKrassen While not perfect; the American legal system is generally very good
1,@fentasyl Are you sure about those numbers?
1,@stevenmarkryan That was a long time ago and the rest of industry still hasn’t caught up!
1,@DrJBhattacharya The public blowback over those unconscionable restrictions will be severe
1,@ZubyMusic Censoring the public on behalf of governments is a lot of work!
1,@cb_doge Lmaooo
1,@xDaily Well of course they prefer censorship-friendly social media.   The Australian public does not.
1,@McDonalds That Oreo Frappé looks awesome!
1,@micsolana People see in others what they fear exists in themselves. @mattyglesias is one such person.
1,@MuskUniversity Our policies make this inevitable
1,@MuskUniversity Obviously
1,Starship Super Heavy Booster https://t.co/3065srPugD
1,@truedivineright @dom_lucre 😂  Would be a genius move on their part
1,@dom_lucre If you can find advertisers that want to advertise alongside your content; then you get revenue share. We cannot make them do this.
1,@Rasmussen_Poll @Support @lindayaX Our user-seconds have reached all time highs in recent months; so something is wrong. Will investigate.
1,@cb_doge The product is just … not good
1,@TEDchris @tferriss @joerogan @megynkelly @amolrajan @lexfridman @kwelkernbc @karaswisher @JohnDonvan That sounds like a good idea too.   This is really fighting as (I believe) a noble sport. We also hope; with humility; to express our admiration for those who have fought before for noble causes.
1,@dvorahfr Will inquire
1,@EdKrassen Exactly!
1,@greg16676935420 You’re welcome
1,@WokelyCorrect Why is Western media like this?
1,@Teslaconomics Good question
1,@stclairashley They absolutely mean literal genocide.  Why are organizations like @ADL silent?
1,@CollinRugg *collude
1,@CollinRugg Fate loves irony. Over what period of time did McGonigal collide with Russia?
1,@GRDecter Exactly. He can’t lose; which is why he loves these crazy high fed rates.
1,@dogeofficialceo They also used to say that you couldn’t play video games for money too; now we have esports pro leagues!
1,@HXMnCK @growing_daniel Literally true. The fewer people that sign up; the more revenue that X keeps!
1,@MuskUniversity Exactly
1,@cb_doge So glad to see this happening!
1,@anothercohen Will see if this is feasible. It would add a lot of complexity.
1,Falcon flies again
1,@EndWokeness @ConCaracal Shame on @nytimes. Shame; shame; shame.
1,@WholeMarsBlog 13 years is a long tour of duty. Zach will spend time with friends &amp; family; then do something else.
1,@FredLohner Yeah; this will be great!
1,@billmaher Why do they keep pushing these lies?
1,@ajtourville People have no idea yet
1,@CollinRugg @CatchUpFeed Good for him!
1,@ConCaracal @EndWokeness The lack of condemnation about EFF actively calling for genocide is appalling
1,@PeterDiamandis I guess I’d try to figure if there is some way to know what it is like outside the simulation
1,@EvaFoxU Something is deeply broken in western journalism
1,@0xgaut Pretty much 😂
1,@xDaily Since the algorithm recommends posts based on how much time people spend on them; both video and text content posted on this platform naturally get boosted more than links off platform; as the time spent on a link is short
1,@xDaily Maximizing unregretted user-seconds
1,I would like to thank Zach Kirkhorn for his many contributions to Tesla over the course of 13 often difficult years.   Much appreciated and best wishes for the next stage of his career.
1,@ehikian This will be cool
1,More interesting than you may expect
1,@vincent13031925 Still don’t know if real or AI-generated 😂
1,@TheWarEnglish Yum cake 🎂
1,@dvorahfr If the goal of AI is curiosity; aka understanding the universe; then it will aide humanity; because we are more interesting than not-humanity
1,@SethDillon A moral civilization; by which I mean one where individuals act for the collective good; will outcompete an immoral civilization.   Said another way; teamwork is power!
1,@MuskUniversity We still have a long way to go
1,@Teslaconomics Nobody lives forever
1,@WholeMarsBlog I think we may have figured out some aspects of AGI. The car has a mind. Not an enormous mind; but a mind nonetheless.
1,@Austen McDonalds is technically a Scottish name
1,@goth600 So few know how the Internet actually works.   Starlink is an entirely new internet in space – homogeneous; rather than heterogeneous.
1,@nichegamer @Blizzard_Ent Werebear lightning storm druid
1,@goth600 If information fought a war against drugs; which one would win?
1,@telmudic It is definitely confusing. I mean; how many people are coming to dinner?
1,@iCaleb7 @Tesla Yeah
1,@cb_doge Yeah; it was nonstop impersonation; including many “verified” accounts
1,Building Starlink version 2 constellation
1,@theallinpod @X Btw; room temperature superconductors would be nice to have; but not super transformative
1,@theallinpod @X Great to see the full show here!  I highly recommend using pic in pic with sped up video for maximum enjoyment of this platform.
1,@teslaownersSV @Blizzard_Ent Diablo I &amp; II were excellent. Didn’t love Diablo III; but IV is great.
1,@cb_doge Oh the iron y
1,@HallofFameMemes Strong contender for sure
1,Diablo IV is a great game. Nice work by the @Blizzard_Ent team!
1,Am going with @WWE as my fighting style
1,@lexfridman @GeorgesStPierre @TeamKhabib Great video!
1,@cb_doge Yeah
1,@ashleevance It even works in Antarctica. Quite well; actually; since demand there is low.
1,@cb_doge You mean these platforms? 🤣🤣 https://t.co/3pWM0vUmbT
1,@MarmotRespecter Go on …
1,@alx A quill 🪶
1,@Tillsbury1 @xDaily Exact date is still in flux. I’m getting an MRI of my neck &amp; upper back tomorrow.   May require surgery before the fight can happen. Will know this week.
1,@liuyuxxd We are working on semantic (AI) search. Will show posts of X that match the meaning of your search; not just the text.
1,@liuyuxxd Definitely
1,@justinamash Well said
1,@BillyM2k Would be cool to see Cybertruck tackle this
1,@EdKrassen @maurice_lippy If the fight is short; I probably win. If long; he may win on endurance.  I am much bigger and there is a reason MMA has weight divisions.
1,@EdKrassen I weigh at least 300 lbs
1,@cb_doge Pretty much
1,Zuck v Musk fight will be live-streamed on 𝕏.  All proceeds will go to charity for veterans.
1,@Kristennetten Product testing &amp; working out kills two birds with one stone!  I swing one of the 45 lb weights for a kettle bell workout.
1,@WallStreetSilv I did not vote for him last election; but such aggressive legal action against a former president is not right
1,@cb_doge Aiming to get to 50 pound free weights this week. I build muscle fast. Physical endurance is my weak spot; so I’m aiming to make this quick.
1,@_LoveArtDeco It’s a civilized form of war. Men love war.
1,Am lifting weights throughout the day; preparing for the fight.   Don’t have time to work out; so I just bring them to work.
1,@BasedBeffJezos Bezos is pretty based these days tbh
1,@Kristennetten CEO is fake title. You need a president;  a controller and a secretary for a C Corp; but all the chief [whatever] officer stuff is superfluous.
1,Immersive video on this platform is starting to get pretty good.   Just tap on any video &amp; swipe up when you want to move on.
1,@mysteriouskat 🔥🔥 I would buy something there for the humor alone
1,@KettlebellLife I often forget to do that
1,@cb_doge Physics and engineering could taught so much better than they are.   A narrative history of how and why they were developed is captivating.
1,@icreatelife Nice
1,@Chachu3m @Snoop_AFC @Jetskigrizzly @Jacksy_eth Might watch that
1,@cctvidiots Alligators are not all that dangerous; but crocs snatch people from the shore and boats every year
1,@cb_doge I once went on a date in college and decided to order dishes backwards; starting with dessert first; which also was not a winning move
1,@joehansenxx @Teslaconomics @lindayaX Not super cheap; but 10X original value is still possible
1,@zerohedge Soros arbitraged politics. He figured out that spending small amounts of money in many obscure; but influential; races is far more effective than money spent on major contests.  The mistake people make is thinking that he did it for the good of humanity. He hates humanity.
1,@helloitstanya98 @X @SweetSirenDream @kerrikgray @aliciatoralll @linda_ungureanu @_LoveArtDeco @RenataKonkoly @Kristennetten @teslanatrix @captainarve We considered calling it Balls; but that could be misinterpreted
1,@cctvidiots Famous last words
1,@MarkCrtlC @alx Thanks Zuck!
1,@alx It’s literally more complicated than 99% of passwords at this point!
1,@stclairashley Indeed
1,@Teslaconomics He doesn’t really need to prepare for anything. The so-called “risk free” rate offered by treasury bills is ridiculously high.
1,@pmarca Feels like that for sure
1,@Kara_Creates Great; let’s have at it!
1,@alx It is how I imagine him speaking
1,@pmarca Technology is accelerating
1,@Teslaconomics Bizarrely; government funding is still being directed to hydrogen trucks. It is idiotic.
1,@cb_doge It makes people feel sad; because everyone on there seems to be living this incredible life; even if they’re actually suicidally sad.  I prefer the truth; even it is dark.
1,@yacineMTB @ID_AA_Carmack We always have been; just that now it’s digital instead of biological
1,@ConceptualJames That needs to change.   And donors should withhold funding until there is change. That will fix things pronto.
1,@farzyness Yeah
1,@mysteriouskat I’m part of the CYA
1,@icreatelife Too real
1,@Austen And we won’t just sue; it will be extremely loud and we will go after the boards of directors of the companies too
1,@teslaownersSV Good question
1,@anothercohen @Stonks_dot_com Literally
1,@Stonks_dot_com Cramer’s track record is unmatched
1,@billykyle @Tesla @teslaownersSV Cool
1,@EvasTeslaSPlaid Nice shot
1,@dogeofficialceo lmfao
1,@mysteriouskat @davidvolodzko This does sound like a good case
1,@libsoftiktok @Kara_Creates Kara; is that accurate?
1,@SethDillon With enemies this foolish; he doesn’t need friends to get elected
1,@waitbutwhy 😂 nice
1,@SawyerMerritt I’m told by my team that the credits are not currently stackable; so the best case is more like roughly $20k and there are significant income restrictions. Still very compelling.
1,@EdKrassen Also; people should watch The Life of Brian. Best movie ever.
1,@EdKrassen Exactly
1,If you were unfairly treated by your employer due to posting or liking something on this platform; we will fund your legal bill.  No limit.   Please let us know.
1,@Austen Super annoying
1,@tszzl That game demonstrated outstanding insight into the stepping stones of actual civilizational growth
1,@MuskUniversity Obviously
1,@saturdayboxes @tszzl This platform is a harsh judge. I love it.
1,@MuskUniversity You can learn anything you want online
1,@telmudic I have a long memory
1,@JonErlichman Diet Coke &amp; Coke Zero are awesome. I don’t care if drinking gallons of it shaves a bit of life off. Worth it.
1,@JonErlichman Dang; that is a lot of 🍎
1,@SethDillon Exactly
1,@SawyerMerritt Really?
1,@alexisohanian @garrytan You can add your own posts to the highlights tab on your profile and bookmark posts of others in different folders
1,@garrytan Definitely! That’s coming soon.
1,@DuneQuoteBot *memes
1,@shoe0nhead They even suck at hypocrisy
1,@cb_doge @X The team worked long into the night. I only left work around 3am.
1,To be eligible for your ad revenue share; you must be an X Premium (Blue) subscriber.   The ad money will otherwise be kept by X if you are not an X Premium (Blue) subscriber.   This program is open to everyone.
1,@ElonMuskAOC I wonder what kind of hotel we would design if we did so.   Our Tesla futuristic diner (Grease meets The Jetsons with Supercharging) in LA should be ready later this year.
1,Long; but interesting. I recommend playing at 1.5 speed with pic in pic; so you can still use X and other apps while listening.
1,@FutureJurvetson @cb_doge @woodhaus2 Hi Steve!
1,@RampCapitalLLC Amazing
1,@EMostaque Tell me about it …
1,@marmars Please add your suggestions for features &amp; fixes in this reply thread.   We want video on this platform to be the best in the world.
1,Interest in ad rev share by content creators has far exceeded our expectations; so will take a few more days to process.   Major payouts coming soon!
1,@EndWokeness They are actually killing white farmers every day. It’s not just a threat.
1,@cb_doge @X Really?
1,@DC_Draino The public deserves the right to see this
1,@ElonMuskAOC @catturd2 True
1,@catturd2 Hear me out “Instagram … but without the pics!”
1,@zerohedge Good
1,@alx Aiming for 50 lb weights next week
1,@BillyM2k @disclosetv Absolutely
1,@CramerTracker Yikes
1,@jordanbpeterson We do need to move towards a sustainable energy economy; but we don’t need to make people’s lives miserable or demonize oil &amp; gas (which is definitely needed for many years to come) along the way.
1,@helloitstanya98 @RenataKonkoly @teslanatrix @SweetSirenDream @kerrikgray @captainarve @DimaZeniuk @JaneidyEve @EvaFoxU @jessica_kirsh Sorry about that. We’re working on it.
1,@anothercohen I have many good memories of taking my kids to the Cheesecake Factory at The Grove in LA
1,@GailAlfarATX The overarching vision is for X to be a maximally effective group mind for humanity
1,@ZubyMusic I have serious concerns about SSRIs; as they tend to zombify people.   Occasional use of Ketamine is a much better option; in my opinion. I have a prescription for when my brain chemistry sometimes goes super negative.
1,@stevenmarkryan Success is not guaranteed; but excitement is!
1,@cb_doge And we never will
1,@PrinceVogel Interesting idea
1,@LibertyCappy Seems low
1,@ZubyMusic @Cobratate True 😂
1,@CBSNews Makes sense
1,@enriquebrgn Which is great! They should be.
1,@cb_doge That’s the goal!
1,@jordanbpeterson He has repeatedly called for killing of all white people. The “for now” part is false.
1,@woodhaus2 Thanks for everything you’ve done for Tesla!
1,Preparing for next Starship flight! This time; I think we have ~50% probability of reaching orbital velocity; however even getting to stage separation would be a win.
1,@alx Yeah
1,@anothercohen Austin is booming
1,@stillgray And NY Times is his racial genocide apologist
1,@EndWokeness Melama literally just had a stadium of people chanting for racial genocide. He is beneath contempt.
1,@DirtyTesLa @Tesla Yeah; it’s much better
1,@tunguz The crazy thing is that they’re happening simultaneously!
1,@EFarraro Exactly
1,@farzyness One day it seems like we’re headed for a recession; the next day everything’s fine. Hard to tell what the heck is going on!
1,@Gedmark @VardaSpace Would be awesome if this is commercially viable. Super hope so.
1,@charliekirk11 Extremely disturbing
1,@BillyM2k Dogs rock
1,@waitbutwhy Either an x or a post
1,@NameRedacted247 Good question
1,I know some people hate on them; but I have to credit the whole @Starbucks team with reliably serving millions of coffees &amp; snacks every day around the world
1,@teslaownersSV Exactly
1,Legacy media and the truth … https://t.co/akvZuYuTm5
1,@MattWallace888 I like it 😂
1,@EndWokeness Yeah; they are contemptible hypocrites
1,@ZubyMusic Yeah. More and more countries are.
1,@ZubyMusic Absolutely! Humanity is dwindling and we are being led by geriatrics.
1,@netcapgirl Yikes
1,@0xgaut Does look beautiful tbh
1,@zGuz Their entire coverage of SBF was absurdly positive. They all the sympathy in the world for SBF and none for those he scammed.
1,The New York Times actually has the nerve to support calls for genocide! If ever there was a time to cancel that publication; it is now.  You can read their articles for free anyway using https://t.co/2NjvMTsWmj. https://t.co/ow11wxw7Ny
1,@alx Zuck himself barely uses it
1,@MuskUniversity Yeah
1,@LibertyCappy They lost the plot long ago. Shame on @NYTimes. Shame; shame shame.
1,@WholeMarsBlog It’s been a while; but I used to love doing that
1,@SawyerMerritt @Tesla It’s been great working with @PepsiCo
1,@nikitabier Seriously
1,@xQc Yeah; needs refinement
1,@nypost Happens much more often than people realize. Too much pure water desalinates your body.
1,@KanekoaTheGreat @joerogan @patrickbetdavid True
1,@gigaj0ule Hopefully makes it past phase 3
1,@EvaFoxU Probably not 😂
1,@demishassabis @emblebi When will the first product that uses AlphaFold ship?
1,@alx Why do you say nothing; @ADL?
1,Live video now works reasonably well. Just tap the button that looks like a camera when you post: https://t.co/ILQEQFmY5R
1,@EvaFoxU Still true
1,@ID_AA_Carmack i^2 heating is tough
1,@GRDecter No we aren’t
1,@GRDecter How many times has he predicted a crash that didn’t happen?
1,@WholeMarsBlog Good grief
1,@SawyerMerritt @GerberKawasaki Ross doesn’t seem to realize that content creators need to earn a living.  We are hell bent on making this platform the best place on Earth for great content creators!
1,And I learn more here than anywhere else; from artificial intelligence to new discoveries in superconductivity!
1,I get more laughs from this platform than everything else combined and I hope you do too.  Thanks for posting such great content!
1,@cb_doge It committed the cardinal sin: boring people to death
1,@gekaminsky @dcexaminer @JudiciaryGOP Interesting.   Center for Censorship; Disinformation and Hate! That’s what they actually do.
1,@BillAckman @kgreifeld Yeah; short term T-bills are a no-brainer
1,@BillyM2k Looks awesome. Is it off the shelf or modified?
1,@unusual_whales No work is being done on this to the best of my knowledge
1,@ZubyMusic Absolutely
1,@micsolana We will find out when those donors testify under penalty of perjury
1,@KanekoaTheGreat It had to be explained in terms most would understand.  The point was not actually to create a traditional bank or “send payments”; but rather to fix the information problem that people call money.
1,@cb_doge Exactly
1,@WallStreetSilv Best name ever
1,@SethDillon @TheBabylonBee Definitely worth it!
1,@PaulGoodman24 They do at my companies

1,@WholeMarsBlog Hell yeah!
1,@WholeMarsBlog A few times a year; I take Sunday afternoons off
1,@lucasnantonio @CommunityNotes Great work
1,@DrKnowItAll16 Cool; more people should post long videos on this platform
1,@enriquebrgn far better to delete code than add it
1,@xDaily This is bizarre. They want us to pay *them* for traffic to their site where they make advertising revenue and we don’t!?
1,@krassenstein Exactly! 🙏
1,And a massive amount of infrastructure software &amp; hardware improvements!  We will do a post on that too. The list of technical achievements by the X team is incredible.
1,@dogeofficialceo Agreed; we’re working on it
1,@HSajwanization Will do
1,@krassenstein Absolutely. You can also hold subscriber-only Spaces and have amazing conversations with people around the world!
1,@libsoftiktok Yeah; that’s coming soon
1,Super Important to Support Creators!  If you can afford it; please subscribe to as many creators on this platform as you find interesting.   People from every corner of the world post incredible content on 𝕏; but often live in tough circumstances; where even a few hundred
1,Interesting interview of Devon Archer by @TuckerCarlson
1,@cb_doge Maybe we’re in the afterlife
1,@itsALLrisky Lot of merit to decentralized control
1,@ggreenwald @lsanger This is a major problem.   Also; it seems that the real purpose of many legacy media orgs is simply to provide “official media citations” that support a politically biased Wiki page.  Where do you even find physical magazines or newspapers these days –the scroll reliquary!?
1,@lovati @Benioff Exactly. If successful; X will enter the vernacular in ways that we don’t yet know.   “Saw it on X” “Posted on X” “Paid on X” “Drunk texted my X gf” Etc
1,@ZubyMusic Was buried in Tesla work all day; so unfortunately missed out; but that is good to hear 😂  So long as this platform is not boring; it will succeed.
1,@justindross @patrickc This is the limiting factor
1,@patrickc Indeed; many parts of the world are reaching high peak levels of renewable energy production!  Due to the obviously intermittent nature of wind and solar power; the limiting factor for renewable energy growth is increasingly stationary battery packs at utility scale.
1,Thank you for your contributions to information accuracy on this platform!
1,@MuskUniversity Critical thinking should be the first thing we teach kids
1,@MuskUniversity Yeah
1,@ylecun Such a sharp drop in the US life expectancy curve doesn’t seem correct
1,@Scobleizer Vehicle control is the final piece of the Tesla FSD AI puzzle. That will drop &gt;300k lines of C++ control code by ~2 orders of magnitude.  It is training as I write this. Our progress is currently training compute constrained; not engineer constrained.
1,@GonzaloLira1968 Troubling posts
1,@ScottPolhamus @fireship_dev What won’t be?  It is unreal how much of AI is data curation and heavy compute. Certainly isn’t lines of code!
1,@fireship_dev 😂  I loved coding so much. It was cool that people would give you money for it too.
1,Unless there are a few issues where you at least slightly disagree with your political party; then you are not in a political party; you are in a cult
1,@deliprao It isn’t clear to me why people like Feynman’s physics lectures so much. I found them to be ok; but not great. Wouldn’t recommend them either to those who want to learn physics or those who have.  His non-physics books; like “Surely you’re joking …” are great.

1,@ZubyMusic Things have changed a lot even since ~2017
1,@OwenSparks_ Is Barbie (the movie) maybe better than Oppenheimer? Is that even possible? Who has seen both?
1,@monitoringbias Too much sensitivity around offending almost anyone is killing comedy!
1,@alx You can tell it’s propaganda when they choose terms that are impossible to invert. Who is “PRO” hate speech!? 🤣  Their actual goals have nothing to do with hate speech and everything to do with censorship of public dialogue.
1,@alx Mostly agree
1,@cb_doge Some people just have a dirty mind … 😂
1,@intelligent_eat @BillyM2k That’s what I’m wondering. Sounds like most of the movie is about his life before &amp; after Los Alamos; which is about 1% as interesting as what actually happened in Los Alamos.
1,@Benioff That’s great! Very important that people come into the office or the stores; restaurants; etc can’t stay in business.
1,It is important for more people to come to work in San Francisco or the rest of the city can’t survive
1,@WSBChairman Sigh
1,Oh I get it now! Some people are reading the t-shirt as saying “I ♥️ an AI”. What a funny misinterpretation 😂👀
1,@MuskUniversity There is a downside to this: my internal mental torture is high
1,@MuskUniversity Yeah

1,@WholeMarsBlog @moskov Moskovitz actually said that?
1,@WholeMarsBlog Exactly
1,Many have offered rich incentives for X (fka Twitter) to move its HQ out of San Francisco.  Moreover; the city is in a doom spiral with one company after another left or leaving.  Therefore; they expect X will move too.  We will not.   You only know who your real friends are when

1,Found pic of 𝕏 landlord in San Francisco https://t.co/3CKSAr9ek2
1,@tszzl People should read Feynman’s books
1,@tszzl It is hard to move the needle with physics these days. We need order of magnitude+ more powerful/sensitive hadron colliders for small stuff &amp; space telescopes for big stuff.  Civilization alternates between being science-limited (rare) &amp; engineering-limited (frequent).
1,@BillyM2k It’s true 🖤

1,@SciGuySpace SpaceX provided its knowledge of crewed parachute systems to Boeing and we are happy to be helpful in any other ways.  Designing parachutes for orbital; crewed spacecraft is much harder than it may seem. Was a major challenge for SpaceX.
1,@Nate_Esparza Mars might have a bigger brand
1,@SawyerMerritt Will consider
1,@XNewsDaily Or they can just pay $1000/month for a verified organization subscription with the ability to convey that organizational authority to affiliates. This more than pays for itself in organic reach.  The reason for the $1000/month is to set a moderately high bar to be a verified org;

1,@BillyM2k I can fart hard enough to inflate a car tire
1,Doges ftw https://t.co/bl0trQ7BdU
1,@OwenSparks_ @Tesla They were instrumental to the success of Giga Berlin
1,@TeslaSynopsis Lycurgus; founder of Sparta as know it; laid down the Spartan laws and swore all to an oath that they could not be changed until he returned.  Then went to the temple of the Oracle at Delphi and starved himself to death.   Now that is a BAMF.
1,@viewsoff_ Beautiful views
1,@a_musingcat Yeah
1,@SenWarren @Tesla @SECGov What’s your favorite Halloween outfit?
1,@SenWarren @Tesla @SECGov Can we please be friends please please
1,@SenWarren @Tesla @SECGov Not you again 😮‍💨
1,@SawyerMerritt @Tesla Cool
1,@goth600 “Tesla sued by reality for stealing its data”
1,@goth600 Um yeah it was us
1,@AOC Methinks somebody doth protest too much …
1,@RishiSunak Hear; hear!
1,@TitterDaily @512x512 More improvements coming
1,@krassenstein @catturd2 That sounds spicy!
1,@lindayacc Exactly
1,@TeslaSynopsis Literally watching that rn
1,@TheFigen_ Fight prep
1,@pataguccigoon Well yeah of course. Hope Szilard is in there.
1,@icreatelife A side of fries
1,@growing_daniel True
1,@levie Wild times indeed
1,@krassenstein @Alphafox78 Sometimes we do dumb things
1,@alx Uh oh
1,Great work by the X/Twitter team
1,@zerohedge Crazy times
1,@WallStreetSilv Great idea
1,Starlink available in the Philippines!
1,@DavidSacks @AMercouris Yeah
1,@tanathanwriter Cool
1,@ZubyMusic Edgy thing to say these days 😂
1,@jack24dd30 Nice
1,@zerohedge There are pics of this all over the Internet
1,Orwell was next-level Based
1,@TRHLofficial @LPMisesCaucus 😂  Who are you going to believe; online “experts” or your own lying eyes?
1,Again; could not recommend this book more. Audio version is great. https://t.co/LwuVf09BUd
1,@EndWokeness What were the circumstances?
1,@stillgray Mosquitoes almost killed me with malaria. So impolite of them.
1,@FaustoChou @Twitter @MattNavarra @TitterDaily @TitterTakeover @jonah_manzano @512x512 @alex193a @sarahintampa @jaypeters @TwitterWrite This will allow users to post very long; complex articles with mixed media. You could publish a book if you want.
1,@TitterDaily Hmm ok
1,@DavidSacks @ericschmidt @FareedZakaria Accurate
1,@DrKnowItAll16 @Twitter @TwitterSupport Using your own inline ads is fine for now; until X/Twitter can offer this
1,@zerohedge Would be nice for the public to have some clue how the money is spent!
1,@goth600 I hope so
1,@zerohedge Well; at least SpaceX/Starlink and Tesla have significantly increased US production over that timeframe
1,@imPenny2x Reader?
1,@WR4NYGov Exactly
1,Starlink for sale in Kenya!  Note; buying a Starlink with global roaming allows you to travel almost anywhere.
1,@8teAPi That would be awesome
1,@stillgray I have also heard this anecdotally from many professors and recruiters. Very concerning.
1,@krassenstein Yeah
1,@cb_doge That number sure comes up a lot lol
1,@thackerpd Great question! Let’s find out who is funding the destruction of free speech.
1,@thackerpd Anyone know who is supporting this rat?
1,@thackerpd @CCDHate Who is funding this organization? They spread disinformation and push censorship; while claiming the opposite. Truly evil.
1,@farzyness What actually matters is ads served to other verified accounts (so we know they’re not bots).  We’re working on bugs that caused very few ads to be served on some accounts and also revenue sharing ads served on profile views. This could 10X or more payouts to some users.
1,@WallStreetSilv This will hurt the kids
1,@bett_yu @KPIXtv @greenbergnation 20 times a day?
1,@OppenheimerFilm This will be good
1,@imPenny2x True
1,@InternetH0F Money back guarantee
1,@MattWalshBlog True
1,@TeslaDiva99 Upgrades coming
1,@KanekoaTheGreat @KerryKennedyRFK This does sound crazy. Is the binding difference actually of meaningful magnitude?  @CommunityNotes for comment.
1,Team is improving Communities fast
1,@KanekoaTheGreat Completely indistinguishable from a @TheBabylonBee headline!
1,@10DowningStreet Bravo! Love is love.
1,@TeslaDiva99 Posts of that nature; which diminish the experience; should soon get much less reach
1,@TeslaSynopsis Post great content!
1,Turn audio on for max satisfaction
1,@levie This will increase the spam level of ads. Fortunately; we already suck at ad targeting on this platform.
1,@ianzelbo Seems oppressive
1,@RampCapitalLLC Lmaooo   Copy 🐈
1,@WholeMarsBlog Yeah; there were thousands of articles like this
1,@darewecan @EndWokeness @CommunityNotes Truth is more important than profits
1,@WholeMarsBlog They stand so far to the left that I’m surprised they can even see the right!
1,@EndWokeness Same happens to me; right wing accounts and even advertisers. Latter not good for revenue (sigh).
1,@imPenny2x Wearing their jiu jitsu gi
1,@Remy_Legal You’re welcome.   Friends need to know whether you simply want to feel supported or actually to solve a problem (men often assume the latter); which may entail painful words; so best to tell them explicitly.
1,@0xgaut Can I interest you in a little Kelvin? 🥰
1,@BillyM2k @krassenstein @InternetHOF @MrBeast The set of all things not “far right” is very small these days; media sources say
1,@TitterDaily Not a high priority; given many pressing issues. I suggest images &amp; links for now.
1,@TitterDaily Yeah
1,@sdamico Great idea!
1,Red wine test
1,@krassenstein @InternetHOF @BillyM2k @MrBeast Exactly
1,@TheBabylonBee Lmaooo; but actually they do
1,@garrytan It is insane
1,@garrytan Smart move by Canada
1,@BillboardChris He should have his day in court; but the allegations; and some things he has admitted saying; are troubling
1,@unusual_whales There is trash; there is utter garbage and then there is BI
1,@alifarhat79 The Ford Lightning is a good vehicle; just somewhat expensive; especially given the high interest rates these days for any kind of loan
1,@DrKnowItAll16 Tesla has been focused on this for many years; given the extreme energy constraints of an electric car vs a data center
1,@TheRealBuzz You inspired us all
1,@LarckeningXuruo @wesyang @pmarca I won the first round; but he was taking it easy on me
1,@Enezator Nice
1,@1a1n1d1y @tszzl 😂  Some are OnlyGANs
1,@terronk @tszzl True
1,@Openskies13 Cool
1,@tegmark @UN Absolutely
1,Whatever sins this platform may have; being boring is not one of them
1,@Remy_Legal Friends are far better than therapy. The incentive structure is to keep you hooked; never “cured”.   Be especially wary of therapists in expensive neighborhoods – their true loyalty is to their landlord; not you.
1,@SirineAti DC is still my fav drink
1,@MarkovMagnifico That spigot doesn’t flow like it used to

1,@MarkovMagnifico yeah!
1,@star95011 @EMostaque True; however if he doesn’t even try to rebut Emad’s story; then we should give Emad the benefit of the doubt
1,@EMostaque Noted. Does Cyrus have a rebuttal to this narrative?
1,@matthewesp Not happening
1,@DurantQuotesBot Wise words more than ever

1,@WallStreetSilv There is a crazy amount of control that passive/index fund managers have over publicly traded companies
1,@CollinRugg People actually love people; even strangers
1,@jeremyjudkins_ We’re trying hard to stop bots &amp; trolls on this platform; so that may be part of the reason
1,@EdKrassen @krassenstein 😂😂   Both you guys post quality content &amp; take feedback well
1,@tunguz Negative feedback is good for keeping ego under control
1,@BillyM2k @MyDogeCTO Technical managers need to write or at least review code some of the time or they lose touch
1,@farzyness That is my impression
1,@greg16676935420 He’s really burning the midnight oil lol
1,@readwise @kkiy90 @omarsar0 @karpathy Just use the bookmark function
1,@joerogan Possibly.   Dark matter is what seems most sketch to me.
1,@LibertyCappy Exactly
1,@farzyness @lindayacc Complexity is like an innovation drag coefficient. We are desperately trying to reduce complexity in order to innovate faster.
1,@WholeMarsBlog Yeah
1,@EvaFoxU Great!
1,@mayemusk Exactly
1,@krassenstein @ChooseGoodKarma Yeah; currently Spaces is all cost; zero revenue
1,@krassenstein Good ideas
1,@PicturesFoIder I mean Starlink glued to a PC gaming rig
1,@PicturesFoIder Starlink &amp; gaming rig
1,@teslaownersSV This article is negative; of course; but we did not see the increase in advertising revenue that was expected in June.  July is a bit more promising.
1,@imPenny2x Double
1,@AndrewCritchCA Neuralink can get us maybe even above chimp level
1,@elonmuskewl @xai Good to have as one of the goals

1,@weRessential @PhysInHistory And all math in a computer is actually binary integer. All other math is simulated.
1,@EvasTeslaSPlaid Go for it!
1,@weRessential @PhysInHistory Everything is an integer in this reality
1,@agarwal He definitely needs to go
1,@greg16676935420 He doesn’t seem to care about his new product
1,@bradsferguson Length of quote posts as seen on timeline will be shortened significantly. You will still be able to click through and see the whole thing; but QT’s can’t take up an entire screen.   Ads will also be shortened in vertical height. Cost of an ad will be proportionate to its size.
1,@antoniogm Great!
1,@jim_linz @DrKnowItAll16 We’re working on it. For now; you can use Apple Airplay to watch on a TV.
1,@SethDillon What does “report content” mean?
1,@WSBChairman @zerohedge Sure; but I suggest doing both. If X Corp subscriptions aren’t working out; you can always turn it off.   May as well try it for a few weeks.
1,@zerohedge You should enable subscriptions on this platform. Could even be at a higher price than off platform; as some will pay a premium for convenience.

1,@alx @Lukewearechange My top invention ever
1,@WallStreetSilv All day; every day
1,@teslaownersSV As promised.   Soon; we will share ad revenue from profile page views; which should roughly double payouts.  Note; only views from verified users count; as it is otherwise trivial to bot scam the view count.
1,@stevenmarkryan @TeslaBoomerMama 😂 only had about 5k followers back then
1,@TitterDaily Done
1,@imPenny2x Great
1,@cb_doge @linda_ungureanu Yeah
1,@cb_doge Only $7/month or ~23 cents/day if bought annually via web
1,@imPenny2x Change just went live. Working now?
1,@teslaownersSV Will make a massive difference
1,@imPenny2x We will increase the rate limit for verified users by 50%. Should take effect within a few hours.
1,@imPenny2x Wow. Ok; we will increase the rate limit.
1,@CatchUpFeed I think she’s cool tbh
1,@DurantQuotesBot Vastly so
1,@imPenny2x How much time does your phone say you’re spending on this platform?  Should take ~8 hours of almost continuous scrolling to hit the limit unless we’re doing something wrong.
1,@EvaFoxU @BillyM2k Working on it
1,@imPenny2x That shouldn’t be happening for a subscription verified account. How much time have you spent on this platform today?
1,@BillyM2k We are working on it. High priority.
1,@DogecoinNorway Yeah
1,@DanielleFong What needs to be improved most urgently about DMs?
1,@TeslaAIBot Should be a gamechanger for reducing DM spam
1,@Noahpinion I want the best outcome for the people.  Russia has at least 4 times the artillery of Ukraine and 10 times the ammunition.   We have run out of normal ammunition to send Ukraine; so now send them cluster bombs in desperation; debasing ourselves with no change to the outcome.
1,@RepThomasMassie Thank you for trying to stop this debasement of America
1,@Noahpinion Sending more weapons will change the body count; but not the outcome
1,@Rainmaker1973 Woke mind virus illustrated

1,@netcapgirl On double envelopment day  were sown seeds of defeat;  Canny orphans of Cannae crushed Carthage;  Salt sown as epilogue.
1,@icreatelife Exactly
1,@SawyerMerritt Agreed
1,@fasc1nate What was really wished for https://t.co/lWGDTbYqRL
1,@martyrmade America has always condemned as evil those who use cluster bombs; but now we send them to be used?   No good will come of this. Fate loves irony; but hates hypocrisy.
1,@Rainmaker1973 Our brain paints the world
1,@netcapgirl We’re still negative cash flow; due to ~50% drop in advertising revenue plus heavy debt load. Need to reach positive cash flow before we have the luxury of anything else.
1,@cb_doge He laughed his ass off?
1,@JaneidyEve @Tesmanian_com Starlink serves the least served
1,@paulg @dflieb @garrytan Definitely
1,@LindseyGrahamSC How does this end?
1,@farzyness @xai Thanks; this is helpful
1,@krassenstein @WholeMarsBlog I hope so
1,@jameslavish It’s actually way worse than that when including unfunded obligations
1,@SawyerMerritt @DriveTeslaca It never caught fire. Due to my foolish driving; I crashed the car; doing an aerial 360 on Sand Hill Rd with Peter Thiel; on our way to meet with Mike Moritz.
1,@SawyerMerritt Lot of good memories of that car. It is such exquisite engineering &amp; design!  After Zip2; I had a choice of either a house in Palo Alto or a condo plus a McLaren F1. Took me about a nanosecond to decide.
1,@loganclarkhall Based
1,@SawyerMerritt HW3 cars are actually more advanced than HW4 cars right now; because it takes time to write software &amp; NN train for HW4
1,@sriramk We should be actively recruiting super talented people; not putting up obstacles!
1,@EvaFoxU Scary Boston Dynamics robot videos is why Tesla is making Optimus
1,@brackin SF will rebound bigtime if the people manifest their will to make it happen
1,@alx @xai That is part of my concern
1,@bennyjohnson Japan is awesome 🇯🇵 ♥️
1,@WallStreetSilv Yeah; roughly triple usage per capita of USA
1,@Jason @anothercohen Whatever the percentages; it’s still the best system on Earth. I respect anyone who grinds hard for years to make useful products &amp; services; even if it doesn’t work out in the end.
1,@TheGregYang @xai Great list
1,@DC_Draino Reducing population is 🥜   We need to increase population
1,@unusual_whales I’d be dead long ago if aspartame was dangerous
1,@EdKrassen Good summary
1,@KanekoaTheGreat We should be worried about this
1,@WholeMarsBlog 😂 I deserve that
1,Platform usage up 3.5% week over week https://t.co/5wdyrzcyhy
1,@TitterDaily Good summary
1,@cb_doge And if it doesn’t offend some people; you know it’s not truth-seeking
1,@RichardDawkins The placebo effect in the limit
1,xAI discussion on Spaces now
1,@krassenstein You can now limited new DMs to verified users only (plus those you follow)
1,@cb_doge And I love ice cream
1,@imPenny2x Exactly. And those who try to game the system in ways that materially diminish value for other users of this platform will get dinged.
1,@wesyang @pmarca Smashed my disc in a sumo fight https://t.co/j9slxsDa9c
1,@wesyang @pmarca I might need an operation to strengthen the titanium plate holding my C5/C6 vertebrae together; but otherwise good to go
1,@pmarca Great post!   Pretty much the only thing that will get me to work out is fight prep. I know a lot of people love it; but I hate working out.   My kids did Brazilian jiu jitsu for a decade; now two of them do Muay Thai.
1,@telmudic She seems cool
1,@KonstantinKisin Definitely
1,@Chesschick01 @TateTheTalisman Yeah; maybe a tab that you can swipe to that focuses on video &amp; photos
1,@WholeMarsBlog Exactly!
1,@TateTheTalisman I don’t think it will kill Instagram; but it is definitely a feature we should have
1,@SenSchumer Great!
1,@enriquebrgn This is basically a group chat for Earth
1,@wiz_trades_ @MarioNawfal So desperately they can taste it
1,@MarioNawfal The cringe level will make your toenails curl
1,@zerohedge Yikes
1,@webflite Some people think these are chemtrails to control our minds.   Frankly; if these illuminati care so much and are this organized; maybe they should be in charge.   Unfortunately; I cannot figure out what they want us to do??
1,@ID_AA_Carmack Heat pumps ftw
1,@alifarhat79 Cramer’s inverse curse still 💪
1,@CramerTracker @greg16676935420 Brands doing cringe posts 🤮
1,@JamesEsses Major problem
1,@Noahpinion Is there a chart by college major? I suspect that is a big factor.
1,@krassenstein Good advice.   Very important note that the algorithm increasingly gives weight to time spent on a post; which means putting longform text &amp; video on this platform gets more promotion than off platform.
1,@ZubyMusic I hate that
1,@TheRabbitHole84 “Never went to therapy”  Please put that on my gravestone
1,@imPenny2x I have a fondness for cappuccino art. The excellent people at Polo Lounge in LA made an amazing free the bird one for me shortly after the acquisition.
1,Looks like this platform may see all time high device user seconds usage this week
1,@Scobleizer You’re welcome!  This is not in response to competitors. I announced we would do this in February. Sorry it took so long to roll out.  It is only right that content creators are rewarded for their contributions.
1,@TeslaSynopsis I should wear that
1,Testing
1,Spaces discussion with @xAI team tomorrow at 1pm PT
1,@stevenmarkryan It’s not exactly per impression. What matters is how many ads were shown to other verified users.  Only verified users count; as it is otherwise trivial to game the system with bots.
1,@alx The real bribe is WaPo paying her for “journalism”
1,@dogeofficialceo Fact
1,@PrinceVogel Try meeting someone on this platform. Many have.

1,Life; the Universe and Everything
1,@TitterDaily Revenue payout to content creators will be cumulative from when I first promised to do so in February
1,Extremely concerning
1,@garrytan Absolutely
1,@enriquebrgn We do need to fix this soon. It is nuts 😂
1,@JudiciaryGOP Insanely illegal overreach by FTC
1,@RobertKennedyJr So it goes …
1,@EdKrassen I don’t think the FBI should be defunded; but there is clearly need for reform
1,@realchrisrufo @SethDillon Disturbing
1,@sundarpichai Interesting
1,@TitterDaily FTC overreach has gone absurdly far beyond the legal mandate granted by Congress.   Weaponization of government agencies for censorship &amp; political machinations needs to stop.
1,@RepMattGaetz This platform is unique in no longer rubber stamping FISA queries. They must be soundly justified.
1,@EvaFoxU Progress
1,@Rainmaker1973 Maybe that’s what the Rolling Stones meant https://t.co/6fjI5FQiS7
1,@publicarepolice @Alphafox78 @TwitterBlue @Twitter Good point; will do
1,@Alphafox78 Sick remix
1,@davidasinclair Ok; so what exactly is it?
1,@WholeMarsBlog Accurate
1,@TitterDaily Several entities tried to scrape every tweet ever made in a short period of time. That is why we had to put rate limits in place.
1,@stevenmarkryan It’s not AGI until it can solve at least one fundamental physics problem
1,@shaunmmaguire The 10 mins test is a good one
1,@alx There are no angels in war
1,@lexfridman @xai I keep telling people I’m an alien; but no one believes me 😉
1,@dogeofficialceo Yeah
1,@lexfridman @xai I often wonder where consciousness starts; as we progress from one cell to ~35 trillion cells.  If the Standard Model is correct; then quarks &amp; leptons become “conscious” no later than ~13.8B years from start; assuming there are no sentient aliens.  Btw; where are the aliens!?
1,@xai And what are the most fundamental unknown questions?   Once you know the right question to ask; the answer is often the easy part; as my hero; Douglas Adams; would say. https://t.co/Bo6v8E1Ooq
1,@WallStreetSilv A. How is it not already a serious felony? B. Wtf!?

1,@ID_AA_Carmack @gdb The answers sound correct; but often are simply confidently wrong
1,@cb_doge Run the thought experiment: you’re stranded on an island with no hope of rescue. You can have a pallet of food or a billion dollars. The latter has no value; because there are no resources to allocate.
1,@JonErlichman Your phone has more computing power than the entire Apollo moon program combined!
1,@gdb When will AI answer questions better than any human?

1,Truly absurd. Judges as website editors!?  We should at least ATTEMPT to fire this junky jurist.   The notion of having a judge job for life; no matter how bad the judgments; is ridiculous!  Enough is enough.

1,Exactly
1,Government-controlled media
1,@WallStreetApes Same
1,The reason the Dems imported so many illegal voters was to achieve permanent one-party control; just like happened in California
1,Democracy in America is being destroyed by judicial coup.   An activist judge is not a real judge.
1,America would have become a one-party state
1,The Dems sold America for political power
1,ABSOLUTELY!!  There is zero doubt about it.   Zero.
1,@jamesbrooksco Same thing is happening in UK and much of Europe
1,They’ve been importing voters to gain control.  Your country is being stolen from you.

1,@CaptMarkKelly Mark; why do you just do what you’re told?   When we speak in person; you talk like a human; not an NPC; but then you (or your intern) post stuff like this and you always vote Democrat; even when it’s against the interests of your constituents.
1,@robbystarbuck By far.
1,@TylerDurden There should at least be charges filed against the worst offenders!
1,At this point; I am 100% certain that the magnitude of the fraud in federal entitlements (Social Security; Medicare; Medicaid; Welfare; Disability; etc) exceeds the combined sum of every private scam you’ve ever heard by FAR.   It’s not even close.

1,Thank you
1,Exciting to see the momentum of true patriots who want to fix America!
1,Holy cow; the deficit is even worse than expected!!  Fraud and waste accelerated massively under the Biden administration
1,Under Biden; FEMA took money AWAY from Americans in need of disaster relief and spent it on 5 star hotels for illegals.   Pure evil.
1,No kidding …
1,They are hiding massive fraud and don’t want their grift to end.   This is how we know we are over the target.   Everything @DOGE does will be published for the world to see.   Let the public judge for themselves.

1,@JTLonsdale Yeah; these spam texts drive people crazy; especially in battleground states
1,What happens is that those who want the government corruption &amp; waste to continue will shop around the country for an activist judge to do their bidding.   It is an undemocratic and unconstitutional power grab by a tiny group of radical leftists!
1,Very true!  Many times; the @DOGE team has found excellent people at the working level in government who want to do the right thing; but have been prevented from doing so by prior management.   Treasury is a great example.   If we just empower them to make the sensible decisions

1,@TodayInSportsCo True 😂
1,CFPB has $711M? That money should be returned to taxpayers.
1,Under Biden; FEMA betrayed the American people by diverting funds meant for natural disasters to pay for luxury hotels for illegal migrants
1,Yeah; I can’t emphasize this enough!  The goal of auditing the Social Security Administration is to stop the extreme levels of fraud taking place; so that it remains solvent and protects the social security checks of honest Americans!  That’s it. That’s the goal. End of story.
1,Definitely not; as they are murderous thugs. This is so crazy!
1,Among many other things; @DOGE today canceled a $17M project to provide tax policy advice to Liberia.   Why would anyone think that this is a good use of YOUR tax money? 🤦‍♂️
1,Listen Larry; we need to stop government spending like a drunken sailor on fraud &amp; waste or America is gonna go bankrupt.   That does mean a lot of grifters will lose their grift and complain loudly about it.   Too bad. Deal with it.
1,Absolutely.   The people unequivocally voted for major government reform.   Judicial tyranny is grossly improper!
1,This tells me that he is trying to hide MASSIVE fraud
1,This is crazy!
1,@SawyerMerritt Cool
1,Absolutely
1,@alx He’s afraid of us finding his graft
1,Yes; that was a huge lie by the Biden administration.   Funds were diverted from almost every part of the federal government to maximize the number of illegals in America.   There also appear to be significant funds siphoned from Social Security to pay for illegals.  @DOGE
1,True
1,There should definitely be accountability for this
1,Seriously 🤣🤣  And for damn sure; I’m 1000% more trustworthy than untold numbers of deep state bureaucrats and fraudsters who may be misusing your SSN right now.
1,There is a massive effort by the UNELECTED bureaucracy to oppose the ELECTED President; House &amp; Senate!!  This is why I say the true &amp; noble battle is to restore DEMOcracy; rule of the people; from the BUREAUcracy; rule of the bureaucrats.
1,True
1,@stclairashley True
1,You are right.   The truth is that NGOs are used by governments to do things that are illegal to do directly or would be opposed by the public.   Super shady.
1,@alx She was lying

1,@MarioNawfal Unfortunately; I’m in the middle of critical work in Washington DC.   I can participate via video.

1,It is outrageous
1,Wow. I recommend looking at all media and software subscriptions for either full cancellation or reduction.
1,It is obviously an oxymoron to be a government-funded; non-governmental organization.   They are simply an extension of government; but with less accountability and a false veneer of independence.
1,Yeah
1,@AuronMacintyre Crazy
1,@iamyesyouareno Does @ADL still hold this position?
1,The @DOGE team just discovered that FEMA sent $59M LAST WEEK to luxury hotels in New York City to house illegal migrants.   Sending this money violated the law and is in gross insubordination to the President’s executive order.   That money is meant for American disaster relief
1,It’s time

1,@JoshuaHays_ Exactly
1,Correct: the rules for the past four years made it impossible to win a federal research grant without some form of DEI
1,The federal government has forcibly injected DEI into everything.   Most people still don’t get it.   Everything.

1,A high price was long since paid
1,@realMaalouf Slavery was everywhere for all of human existence; until the past few hundred years
1,This genocidal lunatic is the leader of a significant political party in the South African parliament
1,Those are just the explicit DEI grants found.   Vastly worse is that EVERY education and research grant made over the past four years required DEI in one form or another.
1,Yeah; it’s crazy.   My rough guess is that there are tens of millions of media &amp; software subscriptions that are unnecessary in the government.

1,@mazemoore @DOGE @USTreasury The best way to understand the system is that it is designed for complaint minimization: people don’t complain if they receive money; but do complain loudly (especially fraudsters!) if they don’t receive money.

1,@dinkin_flickaa True

1,One of these days; a large comet will hit Earth and destroy almost all life; as has happened many times in the past.  Eventually; the Sun will expand enough to boil the oceans and destroy all life.   Either become a spacefaring civilization or die – those all the two choices.
1,@SawyerMerritt @SpaceX Cool
1,@MarcusHouse The fundamental problem is that humanity will forever be confined to Earth unless there is radical reform at the FAA!
1,@ajtourville @RepKeithSelf Much appreciated
1,Starlink available in Yemen!
1,@MarioNawfal Amazingly; no Starliner fines for Boeing!   The FAA space division is harassing SpaceX about nonsense that doesn’t affect safety while giving a free pass to Boeing even after NASA concluded that their spacecraft was not safe enough to bring back the astronauts.   There need to be

1,Exactly

1,@stclairashley They have actively encouraged people to kill Trump.   Reid Hoffman said to the whole audience at Sundance that he wished Trump would be “real martyr”; ie dead irl.
1,@Jason Yeah
1,@PeterSweden7 Because the media is the far left
1,@MarioNawfal The media programs people to think a certain way
1,@cb_doge Assassination is censorship in the limit

1,@growing_daniel Just replace the term “journalists” with “rabid far left activists” and it makes total sense
1,Massive voter importation to make swing states permanently blue and turn America into a one-party state.   It is rational from the Democratic Party standpoint; as it guarantees victory if successful.
1,@Rob_2628 Current season or next?

1,Real question
1,The publicly-stated goal by almost all leaders of the Democratic Party is to legalize the ~15 million illegal migrants as soon as possible; as well as bring in tens of millions more.   That would immediately make all swing states deep blue; just like happened in California with
1,@Yrouel86 Yeah; happens a lot
1,@DillonLoomis22 Bizarre that so many people still believe the media

1,Great work!
1,Great rebuttals
1,@stats_feed Exactly
1,@charliekirk11 Many good people died; no one got fired for botching the job. That is messed up and will result in future innocent people dying.
1,@TheRabbitHole84 Not that these puny differences will matter. Compared to digital superintelligence; we are all dumb primates with tiny meat computers.
1,@TheRabbitHole84 My anecdotal observation is that gay men (perhaps gay women too) have higher than average intelligence
1,This is the heart of the problem and explains why the Democratic Party won’t even deport illegal immigrant gang members who beat up police on camera; as happened in New York a few months ago.  That’s how badly they want those votes!
1,@SwipeWright Except; yours was correct; as a simple search of the Internet would prove.   The Democratic Party core platform has moved far to the left. The Republican Party core platform has moved slightly to the left.
1,@FinancesWorld @alx Improper priorities; indeed!
1,@alx Hmm; is this the same place that is now releasing pedophiles from prison in order to make room for innocent citizens who complain about those who are murdering and raping their children?

1,@SawyerMerritt And fuel cells and hydrogen combustion cars make LiDAR look smart 😂
1,Vote for Kamala if you want this to happen to your neighborhood!
1,@micsolana Incentives; as usual; explain behavior.   If the Democratic party gains enough voters to win an election by importing them and giving them free stuff; then they will do so.  Only if existing voters are upset enough about this for the Democrats to lose; will it stop.
1,He is right
1,@jk_rowling While asleep; your brain is sorting and integrating the thoughts of yesterday to prepare for tomorrow
1,@WGthink @jk_rowling Both would be bad for creativity
1,@WesternLensman I can’t believe Harari would say something as dumb as newspapers are reliable. That is idiotic.
1,Mario Draghi’s critique is accurate.   A thorough review of EU regulations to eliminate unnecessary rules and streamline activity in Europe would revitalize growth and strengthen competitiveness.   Things should be default legal; rather than default illegal.
1,@WholeMarsBlog We should change that so the yoke is stationary; as it is not mechanically coupled to the wheels. Same goes for when it is on Autopilot.

1,I keep forgetting that Biden is still technically in charge of the country 😂
1,@EndWokeness Technically; it still says “President” on his business card
1,@EndWokeness Biden was just a pretend President … oops; I mean is just a … wait … what’s he doing?
1,@EndWokeness Yeah
1,@MarioNawfal These giant endowments are a mistake.   They allow the universities to become detached from reality.

1,@nfergus @uaustinorg Congratulations
1,@DimaZeniuk Non-SpaceX satellites in orbit also increased; but at a much slower pace.  Starlink is just a different level of technology.

1,@Civilian1A What the heck?
1,@AlecStapp Yeah
1,@SawyerMerritt The McLaren F1 (an amazing sports car) is 50% slower than a Tesla Model S in 0 to 60 mph
1,@paulg Attempting to land giant spaceships on Mars will happen in that timeframe; but humans are only going after the landings are proven to be reliable.  4 years is best case for humans; might be 6; hopefully not 8.
1,@WallStreetSilv Weird
1,@cb_doge Yeah; it’s obviously prone to fraud
1,@AdrianDittmann Well; then I think Neil will be pleasantly surprised by what SpaceX does in the future
1,@ajtourville @Starlink Probably best to have a Starlink ground station for remote towns; as that can provide 10s of Gigabits of bandwidth
1,Not bad; given the circumstances
1,@MaryTilesTexas Thanks!
1,@WholeMarsBlog How many fake articles have you seen about Tesla at this point? 100; 1000; maybe several thousand?  WSJ is talking nonsense.

1,@AdrianDittmann Is this a recent video?
1,@_emergent_ @realDonaldTrump Full amnesty for whistleblowers is critical
1,@ajtourville @xai @Tesla Haven’t read the article; but the above is not accurate.   Tesla has learned a lot from discussions with engineers at xAI that have helped accelerate achieving unsupervised FSD; but there is no need to license anything from xAI.  The xAI models are gigantic; containing; in
1,@jeffreyatucker Indeed
1,@stillgray Whoa
1,@MarioNawfal Is this definitely true!?
1,@WallStreetSilv Max payload to standard Earth reference orbit is actually ~180 tons for Starship when it is fully reusable and ~300 tons if expendable. Latter number is the apples-to-apples number comparing Starship to Saturn V.   &gt;100 tons to the Starlink orbit is the operational spec minimum.
1,That’s the plan
1,@VivekGRamaswamy Yeah
1,The first Starships to Mars will launch in 2 years when the next Earth-Mars transfer window opens.  These will be uncrewed to test the reliability of landing intact on Mars. If those landings go well; then the first crewed flights to Mars will be in 4 years.   Flight rate will
1,Nice
1,SpaceX created the first fully reusable rocket stage and; much more importantly; made the reuse economically viable.  Making life multiplanetary is fundamentally a cost per ton to Mars problem.   It currently costs about a billion dollars per ton of useful payload to the surface

1,@powerfultakes @varunramg What did he say?
1,@CashLorenShow @charliekirk11 That is exactly the problem!
1,@sashayanshin Pretty much
1,@lrocket Definitely for super high pressure tanks; but a stainless steel Starship is roughly similar in mass to a carbon fiber version (which is where we started out) and way cheaper/easier to make.  Stainless gets that massive bump in strength at cryo and needs much less shielding for

1,@MaryTilesTexas Yeah
1,@AdrianDittmann @cyb3rgam3r420 @AceofSpadesHots Doombringer is great for survivability; but can’t clear high-level pits fast enough.   To win; you basically need to speedrun through the dungeon and kill demons super fast with a dagger while wearing only a loincloth 😂

1,@JoeyMannarinoUS @alx It was weird when Biden accidentally called them illegals and had to make a groveling apology
1,@JoeyMannarinoUS @alx Exactly
1,This is why the “homeless” (more accurately referred to as “drug zombies”) problem only gets worse with increased funding
1,We need a secure border.   Unless Trump wins; meet your new building managers …
1,@AutismCapital Well; what are our choices here?   The country is choked with nonsense regulations and excessive government spending is driving a great misallocation of human resources.  Building great projects is practically illegal in America.
1,@Rothmus Sowell is a genius
1,@malm_magnus @StephenM Are there public forensics of this computer glitch? Certainly should be.
1,@AutismCapital Dangerously mad; yet oddly compelling

1,@stillgray Yeah
1,@AutismCapital Yeah. At the time; I thought teachers were demented to have little kids read Lord of the Flies.   I accidentally read Animal Farm when I was maybe 8 or 9 and thought it was a book with talking animals. Kept expecting the story to turn around; but the horse never did come back 😢
1,@eyeslasho Why are there these two buckets? They are a false choice imo.   I prefer the dichotomy of extinctionist vs expansionist. No civilization is stable for long; so you’re either growing or contracting.   The former is far superior and will win.
1,@IterIntellectus @Frantastic_7 @thegenesisbl0ck You are already late
1,Yeah
1,@eyeslasho Yeah
1,@lexfridman That said; most Republican administrations increase the size of government too; especially on the defense side
1,@lexfridman There is 0.0% chance of a Dem administration doing anything except increasing the size of government

1,@HSajwanization Same. I almost died from a mosquito. ☠️
1,@WallStreetSilv Yeah
1,Sure would be a strange reason to shut down the US government 🤔
1,He did this for vast numbers of accounts.   No question that he engaged in election interference in Brazil at large scale.
1,They should take you up on the offer. You are super fair.
1,@MarioNawfal This is not good
1,Exactly
1,I have never been materially active in politics before; but this time I think civilization as we know it is on the line.   If we want to preserve freedom and a meritocracy in America; then Trump must win.

1,@alex_avoigt Yeah

1,@stillgray They will use every legal and illegal trick
1,Congrats to the 𝕏 legal team for defending freedom of speech; the bedrock of democracy!
1,Your tax dollars are being wasted to a degree that is hard to comprehend.   An aircraft carrier costs $13 billion. America could have bought a new navy to better defend the country; upgraded our highways or any one of a number of great things.   Instead; we got fraud.
1,Is Tulsi (a former Democrat btw) still on the domestic terror watchlist?  Even if no longer on the list; it’s insane that she was ever on it.
1,@Chesschick01 Yeah
1,@DrEliDavid It is certainly accurate to say that Churchill made some terrible decisions over the course of his career that resulted in unnecessary deaths; but calling him a “Chief Villain” of WW2 is insane considering the competition for that title!
1,@stockbella @DrEliDavid Sorry!
1,@DrEliDavid My mistake. I listened to part of it; but not the whole thing.   I was even awarded The Churchill Society bronze bowler hat award!
1,@GuntherEagleman @America1stLegal Absolutely
1,There is no legal basis for this whatsoever.   Starlink is a different company with different shareholders.   Moraes; the charlatan in judges robes; cannot even cite a law that Starlink has broken!
1,Because they want to suppress freedom of speech in America too
1,Ferreira is a principled &amp; brave fighter for freedom of speech Brazil.   He could have taken the easy way out. Instead; he fights for the freedom of the Brazilian people!!  🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷❤️🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
1,America needs a President who can talk and answer questions without being spoonfed by a teleprompter
1,Great deal for small businesses and organizations

1,@ajtourville @AIDRIVR Cool
1,This Wired article once again perpetuates the inaccuracy that we turned off Starlink for Ukraine when they wanted to launch an attack on the Russian fleet.   Starlink was barred from turning on satellite beams in Crimea at the time; because doing so would violate US sanctions
1,True; these voting changes were being pushed for a while.   All they needed was a crisis to undermine democracy and freedom.   That is how we lose it: one crisis at a time.

1,@GadSaad This is so absurd.   He was already President for four years and didn’t become “a dictator”!  The tactics used against him are those they accuse him of using.
1,@JTLonsdale @uaustinorg Congratulations!
1,So many lives have been lost; because Democrat policies pander to the criminal clients.   Criminals vote overwhelmingly Democrat; so they don’t want to lose their votes.
1,Why does no one complain about this?
1,@amuse @ElectionTime_ The future of the free world depends on it
1,@stillgray CBS and especially the professional liar they interviewed ARE the disinformation
1,@JMilei You are most welcome!  The example you are setting with Argentina will be a helpful model for the rest of the world.
1,Unless the Brazilian government returns the illegally seized property of 𝕏 and SpaceX; we will seek reciprocal seizure of government assets too.   Hope Lula enjoys flying commercial.
1,This weekend; the @xAI team brought our Colossus 100k H100 training cluster online. From start to finish; it was done in 122 days.   Colossus is the most powerful AI training system in the world. Moreover; it will double in size to 200k (50k H200s) in a few months.   Excellent
1,@anothercohen How does Grok compare?
1,@iamyesyouareno Exactly
1,@amuse Yeah
1,@nfergus @uaustinorg @GregAbbott_TX @JTLonsdale @bariweiss Congratulations!

1,@stillgray Lmaooo
1,@WholeMarsBlog Where will they get the money?
1,One hundred percent!
1,Most of Earth should move to California!  Illegals get free medical care in California as of January and now get “payback optional” $150k loans; funded by California taxpayers; among many other benefits.
1,Exactly
1,@KamalaHarris You are lying
1,Those who want to undermine the Constitution are committing treason
1,True (sigh)
1,Interesting article
1,@WesternLensman Such liars!
1,Super easy to use a VPN if a website is restricted in your location
1,@KlenderJoey @WholeMarsBlog When we were building Starbase; they were the only ones who would deliver all the way from Brownsville; so I would eat their chicken sandwich for many days on end.   We had to order 100 at a time; which came to – believe it or not – $420.
1,@KlenderJoey @WholeMarsBlog Will try the one
1,Worth considering
1,Exactly
1,But if you do; use a VPN for protection 😂
1,Is this definitely arson?
1,@emollick So true
1,@shaunmmaguire Excellent essay by @DavidSacks
1,Only a matter of time before this criminal is behind bars
1,Bravo Brazilians!

1,@WesternLensman @realDonaldTrump Becker is a liar through and through.   The very definition of disinformation.
1,@stillgray Very true
1,@michaeljknowles Maybe they’re speaking from the spirit realm 👻
1,He should be impeached for violating his oath of office
1,People like Ana are great
1,@GadSaad True (sigh)
1,His actions are against the will of the Brazilian people he is supposed to represent
1,The more the people of Brazil learn from the @AlexandreFiles; the worse it will get for him.   He violated the constitution of Brazil repeatedly and egregiously; after swearing an oath to protect it.   Nothing worse than an oathbreaker.

1,True.   I was just with some friends who were saying that their feed had become more toxic lately.   Turns out they had been sharing examples of toxic posts with each other; which makes the algorithm think you love toxic posts.
1,@stillgray It’s just dumb old tribalism.  Weird that an ostensibly smart guy like King can’t figure out that he’s trapped in moral relativism; where everything the “other” team does is bad and everything “his” team does is good.
1,@MarioNawfal Hahahaha
1,Amen brother
1,@StephenKing When no voter ID is required and you can mail in the ballots; fraud obviously becomes impossible to prove.   But when ID is required and you have to vote in person; then fraud is easy to identify.  In Mexico; they solved a lot of the voter fraud just by citizens counting how many

1,@vkhosla We do follow the laws in the countries within which we operate.   The problem in Brazil is that we were ordered to break the law by “the law” with a gag order that we couldn’t tell anyone about it.   Now; tell me Vinod; what would you do?

1,Something deeply misanthropic about these people
1,@fentasyl They are not tax shelters in that the money can’t be used by them personally; but it is leading to a vast amount of “activist zombie money” with self-perpetuating non-profits driving de facto misanthropic goals for humanity.   I’m in favor of deleting this from the tax code.
1,@stillgray I’ve known this for a while

1,My comments in China weren't transcribed correctly. Tesla will keep making cars &amp; batteries in CA &amp; NV as far into future as I can imagine.
1,@JessicaTetreau important to set AC to not recirc (air exits thru rear) and use the snap in shade; which Tesla service can provide
1,@shanenickerson Amount of change needed is enormous - like a spinal cord transplant. Would cost less and work better with a new car.

1,Reasons I like tunnels: you still travel in 3D fast; but immune to weather; quiet and no risk cars fall on your head
1,Flying car pros: travel in 3D fast. Cons: risk of car falling on head much greater; noisy; grounded in bad weather

1,There is no slowdown of the Gigafactory construction underway; as anyone near Reno with eyes can verify. It's not subtle.
1,Some shots of the Gigafactory pilot plant (~20% of full size) under construction https://t.co/OzLzD4LsGW
1,Upgrades in the works to allow landing for geo missions: thrust +15%; deep cryo oxygen; upper stage tank vol +10%
1,Both satellites deployed on target. Now firing their ion thrusters to reach geo station over Europe &amp; Asia.
1,Next landing attempt will be 3rd launch from now. Tonight's flight and following one will not have enough propellant.

1,Tesla Model S rated by @ConsumerReports as best car in world for 2nd year in a row http://t.co/F0TpdmDxGg
1,Landing on a stormy sea http://t.co/7EY25g3IU5
1,Rocket soft landed in the ocean within 10m of target &amp; nicely vertical! High probability of good droneship landing in non-stormy weather.
1,Primary mission on target. Spacecraft head towards the sun! All good there.
1,@DanielLockyer We could actually do that...maybe we should
1,Planning a significant upgrade of the droneship for future missions to handle literally anything. Maybe give it a Merlin for good measure :)
1,Can't delay any longer. Must proceed with primary mission to launch the Deep Space Climate Observatory spacecraft.
1,Mega storm preventing droneship from remaining on station; so rocket will try to land on water. Survival probability &lt;1%.
1,Coming home http://t.co/FmrmYs6R6V
1,Dragon splashdown off the California coast http://t.co/4Bvfmei8I3
1,Launch postponed to tomorrow due to high winds at the Cape; but Dragon still inbound from orbit in 90 mins
1,Extreme wind shear over Cape Canaveral. Feels like a sledgehammer when supersonic in the vertical. Hoping it changes …
1,Prob good though. Will give us time to replace 1st stage video transmitter (not needed for launch; but nice to have).
1,Air Force tracking radar went down. Launch postponed to same time tomorrow.
1,Rocket reentry will be much tougher this time around due to deep space mission. Almost 2X force and 4X heat. Plenty of hydraulic fluid tho.
1,Launching our 1st deep space mission today. Headed to Earth-Sun L1 gravity null point at 1M miles; 4X further than moon.
1,If you are curious about the P85D; you can schedule a test drive here: http://t.co/Eu19pBUpNO

1,P85 acceleration will also improve; but not quite as much
1,Video made by owner of a P85D going up a 14% grade on snow passing a whole bunch of stuck SUVs https://t.co/LC9AHx0fuC
1,Tesla dual motor cars are also all-wheel drive. Main goal of dual motor was actually insane traction on snow. Insane speed was a side effect
1,Tesla P85D 0 to 60mph acceleration will improve by ~0.1 sec soon via over-the-air software update to inverter algorithm
1,"Great DragTimes video of people experiencing P85D ""Insane Mode"" acceleration for the first time https://t.co/gqN9oremMQ"
1,Final one: anything launched by a railgun (if you could ever reach ~ Mach 27) would explode upon exiting the barrel in our dense atmosphere
1,Ion thrusters are great; but have extremely tiny force (photon thruster even less). Must have more thrust than weight or you don't go up.

1,Am super proud of my crew for making huge strides towards reusability on this mission. You guys rock!
1,Upcoming flight already has 50% more hydraulic fluid; so should have plenty of margin for landing attempt next month.
1,Grid fins worked extremely well from hypersonic velocity to subsonic; but ran out of hydraulic fluid right before landing.
1,Didn't get good landing/impact video. Pitch dark and foggy. Will piece it together from telemetry and ... actual pieces.
1,Ship itself is fine. Some of the support equipment on the deck will need to be replaced...
1,Rocket made it to drone spaceport ship; but landed hard. Close; but no cigar this time. Bodes well for the future tho.

1,Welcome back @RicardoR to run the @TeslaMotors communications team!
1,@ID_AA_Carmack That works for Dragon; but hard to do for something long like Falcon
1,The flight grid fins look like the ones on this test we did; but larger: https://t.co/gTaURQQeyx
1,@ID_AA_Carmack No choice. Entry velocity too high for a precision landing with N2 thrusters alone. Must have aero surfaces for pitch trim.
1,@John_Gardi Using legs as air brakes to drop terminal velocity in half requires slight redesign &amp; more data. Maybe flight 21.
1,"Grid fins are stowed on ascent and then deploy on reentry for ""x-wing"" style control. Each fin moves independently for pitch/yaw/roll."

1,@WilliamShatner Will do. Probably at least a few days. Depends on whether we need to pull the turbopumps.
1,We called manual abort. Better to be paranoid and wrong. Bringing rocket down to borescope engines ...
1,If launch aborts; we will bring the rocket down for engine inspection; so probably a few days before next attempt
1,Increasing helium spin start pressure. Probably &lt;50% chance of passing all aborts; but worth a try. Countdown resuming ...
1,Launch aborted by autosequence due to slower than expected thrust ramp. Seems ok on closer inspection. Cycling countdown.

1,Good description of the launch by @WIRED: http://t.co/QnLhvviEAn
1,Don't actually mean to knock Honda -- their cars are solid -- but the park outside (or yr house might burn down) advice was awesome
1,"...but only if you like your house ""Honda recalls Fit for fire risk; says park it outside http://t.co/tLpZ7HBIdV """
1,Saw pressure fluctuations on Falcon boost stage liquid oxygen tank. Want to be super careful; so pushing launch to Thurs.
1,At Disney World w kids for traditional prelaunch visit (first good flight was after riding Space Mountain)
1,Launch can be viewed live from Cape causeways or via http://t.co/soOCggCpN0 webcast around 5:30 local time on Monday
1,@DarkSapiens Easier to make the plane change to equatorial orbit. Done in order to reduce satellite side delta V from 1800 m/s to 1500 m/s.
1,Will be toughest mission to date. Requires coast + upper stage restart + going to 80;000 km altitude (~1/4 way to moon).
1,Headed to Cape Canaveral tomorrow for first @SpaceX geostationary satellite launch.
1,Tesla Model S Consumer Reports customer satisfaction survey highest of any car on road at 99/100 http://t.co/PpuS01S2KN
1,Tesla is also extending the Model S warranty to cover any fire damage even if due solely to a driver accident
1,What makes this incredibly unjust is that the Model S to date has the best safety record of any car on the road (no injuries or deaths ever)
1,Why does a Tesla fire w no injury get more media headlines than 100;000 gas car fires that kill 100s of people per year?

1,@DebbieViviers @SpaceX Yes; upper stage venting of liquid oxygen created a fast moving fuzzy white sphere in space over SA
1,Between this flight &amp; Grasshopper tests; I think we now have all the pieces of the puzzle to bring the rocket back home.
1,Rocket booster relit twice (supersonic retro &amp; landing); but spun up due to aero torque; so fuel centrifuged &amp; we flamed out
1,Launch was good. All satellites deployed at the targeted orbit insertion vectors. http://t.co/SUYMH7W9pH
1,You can watch the launch at http://t.co/2ZSXeqWKvy http://t.co/u5VEUgRu8g

1,Am happy to hear that GM plans to develop an affordable 200 mile range electric car. Right target. Hope others do same.
1,Approach is 360 deg flush mounted tiny cameras + radar (prob not lidar). Lot of software &amp; hardware level image processing.
1,Engineers interested in working on autonomous driving; pls email autopilot@teslamotors.com. Team will report directly to me.
1,Will do another static fire of rocket to make sure all is good &amp; AF needs to test ICBMs; so probable launch Sept 29/30.
1,Full thrust achieved on 2 sec static fire. Some anomalies to be investigated; so launch date tbd.

1,And; uhh no (zillionth person who asked); I am not going to make an IM suit; however design by hand-manipulated hologram is actually useful.
1,@brynmooser Reality is the best illusion
1,We figured out how to design rocket parts just w hand movements through the air (seriously). Now need a high frame rate holograph generator.

1,@schadlu I really hate patents unless critical to company survival. Will publish Hyperloop as open source.
1,@TobiasVdb Yes; it is a purely propulsive landing; but using the huge landing gear A frames as air brakes. Landing prop &lt; 5% of vehicle mass
1,Will publish Hyperloop alpha design by Aug 12. Critical feedback for improvements would be much appreciated.
1,Just completed full mission duration firing of next gen Falcon 9 booster. V proud of the boost stage team for overcoming many tough issues.

1,@SQMInc I don't have a publicist
1,Forgot to say one thing at Tesla annual shareholders meeting: just as my money was the first in; it will be the last out.
1,Vac thrust of 700 tons means avg of 14 tons/floor of structural steel for a 50 story building.
1,@williamricci6 50% higher. ~1.3 M lbs sea level and ~1.5 M lbs vacuum thrust. Will be 60% higher with some tweaks.

1,Worth reading Merchants of Doubt. Same who tried to deny smoking deaths r denying climate change http://t.co/C6H8HrzS8X
1,Yeah; climate change should really be considered a centrist issue; as it affects everyone.
1,Am not suggesting shutting down CO2 production; but rather to price in environmental cost &amp; shift to sustainable energy
1,Even if the answer is only on the order of 1%; we should still take immediate action; as there is only one atmosphere.
1,Right question to ask Dyson or others: what is probability that human actions could cause catastrophic climate change?
1,What most serious scientists have a problem with is the notion of certainty about *any* subject. That is not the point.
1,@kn0xvi11ain Very few. Scientific consensus at time of Columbus was world was round http://t.co/V3XIcob4s8
1,Sorry for all the heavy stuff abt climate change; but I really thought world wd take action sooner. No time for subtlety

1,@CosmicRami Awesome. We really need to promote that fact in the US. A CO2 tax will not cause economy to grind to a halt!
1,Would love to do a pickup truck. Something w ultra low cg for sports car handling; dynamic air suspension &amp; mega torque.
1,"Technically; I ""got rich"" from Zip2 &amp; PayPal w zero govt anything; then put 100% of that into SpaceX; Tesla &amp; SolarCity."
1,If consumption is low; then the tax is proportionately low. We should prob not have tax on basic foods &amp; critical meds.
1,@ponder68 Carbon produced by a @SpaceX rocket flight is roughly equal to one 747 flight. No; we should not be exempt.
1,Net of gas savings; a Tesla is $550 to $600/month with down payment taken care of by tax credits. Maybe less costly then it first seems.
1,Yes; am arguing against subsidies and in favor of a tax on the end bad created. Market will then achieve best solution.
1,Trees are net consumers of CO2; so technically we would pay them money :)
1,Exactly. Seems crazy to risk the CO2 chemical experiment when we have to find another solution anyway.
1,Big difference between taxing people and taxing purchases (ie consumption). Much better to emphasize the latter.
1,@MaxMBerger The collective wisdom of the market is usually (not always) better than the smartest govt regulator.
1,Me &amp; other private money funded Tesla for first 7 years; got IPO+ govt money for 3; now paid back. Yes; carbon tax would be a better way.
1,@grayj_ There should be a constitutional amendment to redo the tax code every ten years; just like we do a census.
1,Weight of scientific evidence. Taxes don't ban a purchase; they just increase cost. Am against bans; except in extreme cases.
1,Exactly. Better to tax known bad thing and incent desired outcome; instead of subsidizing particular solution paths. Let market decide.
1,Perhaps. I am in favor of fair; simple taxes that are neutral on most things; incent good &amp; disincent bad.
1,Great article on Tesla-dealer battle by Leilani Munter (@CarbonFreeGirl); who lives in NC http://t.co/pvEmE5pEVN

1,@ChrisCowan_  Chris is great. Took a long time for me to find someone w truly hardcore engineering skills; who fully understood the system.
1,Am getting lots of questions about the big Supercharger announcement. Aiming to do that the week after next.
1,@stoneymonster Yes; this does put an indirect floor on resale value. Should help all owners.
1,@yatpay Side boosters fall short &amp; center core goes too far + Florida is heavily populated. Landing permission tricky :)
1,@pataneous We can't formally provide a guarantee w/o restating accounting; but I feel confident about the value anyway.
1,@2552nsf Yeah; that is super tricky. Will have to sacrifice a lot of payload to boost back or land on ocean platform.
1,@rebel_sal Yes; your article (and many others) rightly identified that we made a mistake. New financing is not perfect; but much better.
1,@Alan_Nestos The legs are nested tight against the body of the rocket in flight; so rotate about 120 degrees to deploy
1,@darma_setia More likely that pigs will fly over the frozen wastes of Hell. Clarkson doesn't understand technology.
1,@JSONberland We did a ton of testing until they could handle 4X legally required impact energy. Extremely tough.

1,@BjarteReve July!
1,Am headed to TX next week to thank people personally for supporting Tesla. Please head to SB 1659 @ 8am tomorrow #TeslaTX

1,Today's Tesla announcement is actually the 2nd in a 5 part trilogy (love Douglas Adams)
1,@mpauldine You never know ...
1,@stopman Thanks Michael. Beauty of over the air software updates is that the product keeps improving even after you buy it.
1,@jeremys Thanks Jeremy! Good seeing you in LA. Awesome job with Yelp!
1,To be clear; Tesla is in California; so it is not April Fool's yet! Also; some may differ; but imo the Tues news is arguably more important.
1,First profitable Q for Tesla thanks to awesome customers &amp; hard work by a super dedicated team http://t.co/njumz2SDmx
1,About to do chocolate egg hunt with all the kids. Candy bonanza! Happy Easter!

1,@MichaelLindahl It will be slightly smaller w fewer features as std. Think Audi A4 or BMW 3 vs Model S being S7 or M5
1,@Nezheim @jbmeicher sure :)
1,.@jbmeicher Model S works great in cold. Highest sales/capita are in Norway and we have a ton of customers in Canada.
1,But when considering savings of gas v electricity; true cost vs gas cars is more like $25k for a v sweet ride
1,.@benmacy $30k in 2013 $ (ie + inflation) w 200+ mile range w some really cool tech that we can't talk about yet.
1,.@joshj777 It has always been my dream to produce a low cost; compelling electric car. We are 3 to 4 years away. Wish it could be sooner.
1,@malkosh was this in a test drive car (those are all about to be upgraded) or a current customer car?

1,Check out Model S at Tesla Austin Gallery at The Domain opening today! I will stop by this eve and tomorrow morning.
1,@sdvillella nice pic!
1,@RebeccaJarvis Not yet. I look forward to giving that a try.
1,Random trivia: my grandfather &amp; great grandfather were both born in Minnesota. I was named after my GGF.
1,Minnesota auto dealers tried to pass legislation to block Tesla stores. Bill was just defeated in Senate. Thanks MN!
1,@Asherlaw SpaceX is expanding launch ops at Canaveral too. Need 2 locations to handle flight rate and avoid weather risk
1,Arrived Austin. Talking with TX House about creating an orbital launch complex near Brownsville; then #SXSW keynote tmrw
1,@navidob Pretty much. Couldn't leave the country of Ibsen without doing something cultural!
1,Saw a play about Stalin in Norwegian. Like watching mimes with emoticons doing Solzhenitsyn. http://t.co/YsWV6IF3QL
1,Am in Oslo to thank the Norwegian customers of @TeslaMotors personally. Highest Model S orders per capita in the world.
1,Just received #Dragon docking clearance from @NASA. Will begin orbital maneuvers to Space Station at 11pm Pacific time.
1,Would also like to thank @USAirForce for allowing us to use their long range comm system for Dragon in free drift.
1,Just want to say thanks to @NASA for being the world's coolest customer. Looking forward to delivering the goods!
1,Orbit raising burn successful. Dragon back on track.
1,Thruster pods one through four are now operating nominally. Preparing to raise orbit. All systems green.
1,Pods 1 and 4 now online and thrusters engaged. Dragon transitioned from free drift to active control. Yes!!
1,Attempting bring up of thruster pods 2 and 4
1,Solar array deployment successful
1,Thruster pod 3 tank pressure trending positive. Preparing to deploy solar arrays.
1,About to pass over Australia ground station and command inhibit override
1,Holding on solar array deployment until at least two thruster pods are active
1,Issue with Dragon thruster pods. System inhibiting three of four from initializing. About to command inhibit override.
1,Falcon 9 delivered Dragon to its target orbit. All good on the rocket.
1,T minus 22 mins to launch mission 3 to dock with the Space Station http://t.co/TfGUbZSaL3
1,Computer glitch found by @SpaceX avionics while bench testing on IM. Couldn't replicate on vehicle. Launch proceeding...
1,Launch on track for tomorrow morning at 10:10 am Cape Canaveral time
1,@andrewliebchen @_chrissimmons Exactly. Then no need for clean energy subsidies; as externality is priced into mkt behavior
1,@_ChrisSimmons A carbon tax would affect coal even more than gasoline; so electricity would also become more expensive
1,One often hears that there is no point in a US carbon tax unless China acts. Well; they just did http://t.co/SIp9NzkulK
1,Rocket static fire @SpaceX Cape Canaveral launch pad looks good. Engines generated 433 tons of thrust; parameters nominal.
1,@FaeLoba Best is winning competitions like Formula SAE; design/build/fly or other evidence of exceptional eng ability
1,@EricIdle Cool! Btw; thought you might appreciate that 1st flight of Dragon spacecraft carried a large wheel of cheese :)
1,Thanks @CNBC! “@Lebeaucarnews: The Model S delivered what @elonmusk promised. A ride to make you re-think going electric.”
1,Appreciate thoughtful @Sulliview article. Faith in @nytimes restored.
1,Revolutions don't happen if you just roll over to the powers that be. Got to fight for what you believe. That's why http://t.co/GxkT0LVL
1,Genius move “@cdabel114: @CNN Well; to be fair; they did use the controversial gimmick of actually charging up the car”
1,CNN about halfway through East Coast Supercharger test drive of @TeslaMotors Model S w @PeterDrives &amp; @AbigailBassett
1,Testing the Model S on a surface of pure ice and snow http://t.co/OeZwXFSv
1,Btw; more free East Coast Superchargers coming soon. Will allow lower initial charge; v high speed trip &amp; long detours; like NYTimes drive.
1,@batasrki Yeah; Top Gear pretended the Tesla Roadster ran out of charge and they had to push it home. Logs showed 50 miles range left.
1,@tomleykis Thanks Tom! Support of real Tesla customers like yourself who drive the car every day is v much appreciated.
1,Tesla data logging is only turned on with explicit written permission from customers; but after Top Gear BS; we always keep it on for media.
1,"Tesla blog coming soon detailing what actually happened on Broder's NYTimes ""range test"". Also lining up other journalists to do same drive."
1,NYTimes article about Tesla range in cold is fake. Vehicle logs tell true story that he didn't actually charge to max &amp; took a long detour.
1,Busted “@TheOnion: Barack Obama: 'Look; I'm Just Going To Say It: I Collect Antique Nazi Memorabilia' http://t.co/KExXRoBL”

1,@BillAckman Absolutely

1,What a travesty
1,True
1,@clara_winslow @Sargon_of_Akkad Absolutely
1,@Sargon_of_Akkad Good
1,@iamyesyouareno The authorities who ignored her pleas should be in prison
1,Shameful conduct by Jess Phillips.  Throw her out.
1,Absolutely
1,Unquestionably so
1,@robbystarbuck True
1,Political corruption at the highest levels
1,Only Reform can save Britain.
1,Appears likely to be an act of terrorism.   Both this Cybertruck and the F-150 suicide bomb in New Orleans were rented from Turo. Perhaps they are linked in some way.
1,@houmanhemmati This is deeply wrong. Which firm?
1,@eyeslasho Absolutely
1,@robbystarbuck @X @premium Seems to be a bug. Please post screenshots. X just has a small crew working on Jan 1.
1,@robbystarbuck Law enforcement currently believes it was most likely intentional
1,@MaileOnX Tesla vehicles transmit their state of health continuously
1,@Inevitablewest Prison for Phillips now!!
1,We have now confirmed that the explosion was caused by very large fireworks and/or a bomb carried in the bed of the rented Cybertruck and is unrelated to the vehicle itself.   All vehicle telemetry was positive at the time of the explosion.
1,@TRobinsonNewEra This is unconscionable
1,@trussliz @jessphillips She deserves to be in prison
1,@Sargon_of_Akkad Terrible
1,@Sargon_of_Akkad They should all be brought to justice
1,@JTLonsdale Discrimination on the basis of gender or race is illegal; so they are breaking the law
1,@RealDonKeith @TRobinsonNewEra What!??
1,@stillgray Cybertruck is the worst possible choice for a car bomb; as its stainless steel armor will contain the blast better than any other commercial vehicle
1,@BillAckman The right questions to ask
1,@SethDillon Claiming censorship while simultaneously getting millions of views is the clearest possible evidence that Fuentes has 💩 for brains
1,@Inevitablewest Good. They should receive the severest punishment. Hang them for treason.
1,The whole Tesla senior team is investigating this matter right now.   Will post more information as soon as we learn anything.  We’ve never seen anything like this.
1,@Inevitablewest She should be in prison
1,Why is Tommy Robinson in a solitary confinement prison for telling the truth?  He should be freed and those who covered up this travesty should take his place in that cell.
1,Kekius Maximus now at rank 263 after a marathon session of @pathofexile. Many deaths on the hardcore ladder. 🪦🩸🪦 https://t.co/PuBu75dXZW
1,@Sargon_of_Akkad Despicable
1,@EvaFoxU @X @premium Looking into it
1,@trussliz Absolutely
1,@durov Indeed
1,@Inevitablewest They should all be brought to justice.   “Just following orders” is an unacceptable excuse.
1,Absolutely
1,@Inevitablewest Long overdue!
1,@Inevitablewest Absolutely
1,@visegrad24 @BillAckman This is incredibly evil
1,@JoelWBerry True
1,@peterstopcrime Horrific
1,Yeah
1,Vote Reform. It’s the only hope.
1,So many people at all levels of power in the UK need to be in prison for this.
1,@michaelmalice There must be severe punishment for these heinous crimes. Those in power most of all; but even the police who went along with it.  “Just following orders” is an unacceptable excuse.
1,@martianwyrdlord Unconscionable and unforgivable

1,@NicoleBehnam Exactly. The first amendment is protection for “free speech”; not “paid speech” ffs.
1,@jonatanpallesen Who in the government and judiciary allowed this to happen and which of the legacy media covered it up?

1,@MarioNawfal This sounds crazy

1,@alx It broke their brains 🤣🤣
1,@thatsKAIZEN Yeah; it’s just not accurate
1,@lrocket Making life multiplanetary requires a vastly higher standard.   The “competition” is making the equivalent of expendable rowboats; instead of ocean-crossing ships; because their sights are set far too low.
1,@Teslaconomics They didn’t believe me; but then the tsunami came

1,@RodFergusson Thank goodness for modern medicine!

1,Within a few years; @SpaceX direct to cell capability will improve by more than an order of magnitude; due to increased satellite count and improved technology
1,@america True
1,This will be a gamechanger.   Alien-level technology.

1,Made it to the hardcore leaderboard after many deaths.   What we kek in life echoes through eternity! 🐸 https://t.co/EzvcTXoPoI
1,@IterIntellectus This is unconscionable. And the reaction by the British authorities to imprison those who spoke out against is treason.

1,All true
1,@diana_dukic Coming back soon; along with unhinged mode
1,@JohnLeFevre We’re so back
1,@teslaownersSV It has more than twice the thrust already.   When Raptor reaches 300 tons of thrust at liftoff; which Raptor 3.x can probably do (certainly Raptor 4 will); then it will have 10k metric tons of thrust at liftoff; which is 22.5M lb-F; almost exactly three times Saturn V.
1,@stillgray So many deaths along the way …
1,@TurkeyBeaver @SpaceX Great work!
1,@alx They can’t help it 🤣
1,This will be priceless 🤣🤣
1,@Rainmaker1973 V cute
1,Why are rapists given suspended sentences in the UK; but this guy gets 18 months in solitary confinement; despite doing nothing violent?
1,@teslaownersSV True
1,@Rainmaker1973 FP64 or even FP32 is a logic nightmare
1,@CGuyprino @Rainmaker1973 A common story.   Teaching anyone anything needs to start with establishing relevance; otherwise you’re asking our poor little meat computer brain to use up neurons for no purpose. It naturally tends to refuse.
1,@Rainmaker1973 Spot on

1,The legacy media didn’t just ignore Biden’s mental state; they flat-out lied through their teeth about it!
1,Only utterly rigorous pursuit of the truth can lead to understanding the universe
1,@techiedani The brutal reality of the situation will hit like a tsunami towards the end of next year

1,@alx Do we have any idea how it is spent?
1,Government power needs to be restored to the people in America; rather than be held by an enormous; unaccountable bureaucracy!
1,@MarioNawfal Let’s not get carried away!   SpaceX will probably do ~99% of Earth payload to orbit in 2026; despite the rest of industry growing.   Assuming rocket launches by competitors grow at their current rate; SpaceX will probably do 99.9% of payload to orbit in 10 years; but I hope I’m

1,This is how news should work.   By the people.   For the people.

1,@Shawn_Farash Ironic that the Democrats were the big money party this election; massively outspending Republicans; and still lost!

1,@Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Other rocket engines were designed for no (or almost no) reuse. Raptor is designed for heavy &amp; immediate reuse; like an aircraft jet engine; with inspections required only after many flights; assuming instrumentation shows it good. Using hydrostatic bearings certainly helps.

1,@BillAckman @Harvard @MIT @Penn Good question
1,@garrytan Absolutely
1,@TheRabbitHole84 Interesting
1,@HardcoreHistory These are wild times; but still much better than last century.   War is no longer distant with occasional; sanitized news articles. Now you see it in real-time with all the horror.  Perhaps it will lead people to reconsider choosing war.
1,@Rainmaker1973 Cool
1,@JonErlichman And so it will be with electric vs combustion cars
1,Just a normal hat btw; no shako or visage. Don’t have the time or inclination to farm Duriel 200 times lol.
1,@wudijo AoZ is an exercise in masochism lmao. These adjustments are a step in the right direction.   Well; at least I made it to Tier 4 before the patch! https://t.co/t33PcUEQHX
1,@Scobleizer @bindureddy Nice
1,Once again; too much work.  Also; AoZ is an exercise in masochism.  Next time; I will just do it ad hoc.  Cleared Tier 4. https://t.co/i526Fr3Dwp

1,@stillgray I guess a lot of people want him unbanned
1,@MattWalshBlog I agree
1,@chamath Crazy
1,@TexasLindsay_ @TheQuartering @CommunityNotes That is certainly not a valid reason for suspension
1,@EndWokeness Whoa
1,@alx I will hear him out
1,@TheQuartering Will consider. In general; since this platform aspires to be the global town square; permanent bans should be extremely rare.   Also; if he does say something false on this platform; then @CommunityNotes will correct him; whereas that would not be the case elsewhere.   Let’s hold

1,Starlink now in Honduras!
1,@wudijo It is tough

1,@Not_the_Bee So we should just hand everyone a gun as they cross the border? 🤔
1,@TheNotoriousMMA Thanks Connor.   That is an obscure process for sure. The people of Ireland deserve more clarity and transparency in how their leaders are chosen.   Sunlight is the best disinfectant.    Well; I hope you are at least nominated. That would shake things up!
1,@krassenstein The fact is that *someone* has to take care of people when they get older.   Kids now have to take care of their own parents *and* those who didn’t have kids. Not right.   I understand if someone wanted to; but couldn’t have kids for some reason. However; I don’t think it’s cool

1,@westcoastbill Maybe they have some winners coming 🤷‍♂️
1,@MikeBenzCyber Ireland’s current government mistreats the people of Ireland. That is why the people of Ireland are so unhappy with them!
1,Yes; we are highly confident that Cybertruck will be much safer per mile than other trucks; both for occupants and pedestrians
1,Posts on 𝕏 go viral proportionate to how much time users spend looking at them.   People obviously spend way more time watching videos on 𝕏 than if they go elsewhere to watch them; so it is best to post things natively here.
1,@wudijo @maxrollgg I will muddle along with my sub S Tier Druid (sigh)
1,@KettlebellLife Tried; but didn’t like doing crime. GTA5 required shooting police officers in the opening scene. Just couldn’t do it.

1,@WR4NYGov @ParisHilton The ad campaign wasn’t super convincing tbh. I don’t think Paris cooks a lot.

1,@TeslaHype @GailAlfarATX Starship is intended to carry a lot of people on tens of thousands of flights; so needs to be extremely reliable over time. It will be.
1,@GailAlfarATX Starship has 33 engines!  If an engine failure is isolated; then many engines greatly increases reliability (Starship only loses &lt;3% of thrust).   If not; then reliability is terrible. The difference is at least 2 orders of magnitude.

1,@Indian_Bronson Depends on timeframe. Slavery was standard practice almost everywhere on Earth for the vast majority of human history.  While some countries (eg Denmark) acted sooner; the major push to end global slavery was driven primarily by Britain in the late 18th &amp; early 19th centuries.

1,Still hard to believe Starship is real https://t.co/YJCRGrPNS7
1,@ChayaRaichik10 Yeah; it’s absurd
1,@pmarca Yeah! Something scared Ilya enough to want to fire Sam. What was it?
1,@MuskUniversity I really agree with this guy!
1,@BillyM2k Thanks Billy!
1,@stclairashley Russell is perceived as a threat to the establishment media; but Sam is not
1,@DimaZeniuk Looks good
1,@JonErlichman Great approach tbh
1,@WholeMarsBlog That part doesn’t matter.   Synthetic data generation and accurate evaluation; ie recursive self-improvement; is more likely.
1,@JonErlichman A lot has happened
1,@AutismCapital Big Mac(k) has a whole new meaning!

1,@0xgaut Welcome to the PvP of social media
1,@Scobleizer Yeah
1,@wintonARK True
1,@icreatelife Grok will improve rapidly; as it is only ~3 months old.  Our compute alone will double every ~3 months.
1,True https://t.co/QlgMDQJSKR
1,@DrJimFan @RichardSSutton Yeah (sigh)
1,@NicklasNilsso14 This is insane
1,@MikeBenzCyber This Seinfeld episode unfortunately has serious consequences for the world

1,@xDaily But still overlaid on the image. Every pixel matters.
1,@DrJimFan @RichardSSutton Yeah. It’s a little sad that you can fit the text of every book ever written by humans on one hard drive (sigh).  Synthetic data will exceed that by a zillion.
1,@Jason @twitter @X @zstedas Noted
1,@tszzl Exactly
1,In an upcoming release; 𝕏 will overlay title in the upper potion of the image of a URL card

1,@emilychangtv @laurenepowell @marissamayer @sama @CondoleezzaRice What matters is having directors who deeply understand AI and will stand up to Sam.   Human civilization is at stake here.

1,@DavidSacks Yeah
1,@BillyM2k Nice
1,Cybertrucks are on their way to Tesla stores in North America! https://t.co/deuRQr72DI
1,@MikeBenzCyber In other words; “Newsguard” is a propaganda shop that will produce any lies you want if you pay them enough money

1,@cb_doge Front and center
1,@petergyang @TheJackForge @X @xai We will open up access to Grok in blocks of users; prioritized by when they signed up for X Premium+  Want to make sure quality of service is good.
1,@alx Exactly
1,@gregg_re Saying only white people can be racist is obviously a racist definition of racist 😂
1,@WholeMarsBlog OpenAI being (semi) independent is probably better for the world than merging with Microsoft.   Less concentration of power.
1,@jasondebolt @heydave7 Will discuss with Tesla Board

1,@KanekoaTheGreat @stillgray Accurate
1,@KanekoaTheGreat They are pure evil.   How utterly absurd that this organization got major advertisers to boycott our platform for bogus allegations of antisemitism!
1,@cb_doge Could make them faster; but engine production is not the limiting factor.   I’m very excited about the next-gen Raptor engine that is robust enough not to require a heat shield. Will also have more thrust; higher Isp and many other improvements.
1,@teslaownersSV Yeah.   Grok should be available to all X Premium+ subscribers next week.
1,@Scobleizer What tangled webs we weave
1,@stillgray They are evil
1,@icreatelife Any details posted beyond the initial letter?
1,@stillgray Very racist article by Forbes

1,@MikeBenzCyber Justice is well overdue for that bastion of evil
1,@ChayaRaichik10 @ViralNewsNYC Ok; what is a better way to help kids in Gaza? Maybe just direct purchase of pediatric medical supplies?
1,@geoffreyirving Concerning
1,@krassenstein We should do whatever we can to build a better future for all
1,@ViralNewsNYC We will track how funds are spent and go through Red Cross/Crescent.   Better ideas are welcome.   We should care about the innocent regardless of race; creed; religion or anything else.
1,X Corp will be donating all revenue from advertising &amp; subscriptions associated with the war in Gaza to hospitals in Israel and the Red Cross/Crescent in Gaza
1,@BillyM2k Yeah
1,@karpathy @WholeMarsBlog Same
1,@EndWokeness @PeteButtigieg I was just informed by Secretary Buttigieg’s office that he does not know this person and has never spoken to him by phone. They say this was simply one of many pictures at an event.
1,@WholeMarsBlog Yeah
1,@GavinSBaker Absolutely
1,@levie Absolutely. Powerful AI is a powerful double-edged sword.
1,@MikeBenzCyber Live by the sword; die by the sword

1,@EndWokeness @PeteButtigieg 500 victims!! What the hell!?
1,@JohnnaCrider1 Was he arrested for this terrible crime?

1,@yishan Extremely concerning
1,@WholeMarsBlog Corporate shell game
1,@alx The first of many
1,@ChiefTrumpster @X @mmfa The first of many
1,@WallStreetSilv Yes they are
1,@ilyasut Why did you take such a drastic action?  If OpenAI is doing something potentially dangerous to humanity; the world needs to know.
1,@chrispavlovski @SpeakerJohnson @Jim_Jordan They have a long track record of evil deeds. An investigation is badly needed.
1,@EndWokeness Who are the attackers?
1,@shaunmmaguire Yeah; it’s how they operate
1,@SawyerMerritt As promised

1,@saranormous @ilyasut @NoPriorsPod Interesting interview

1,@DrJimFan Align aligning!
1,@MKBHD Good call
1,@Kristennetten Microsoft achieved de facto control of OpenAI some time ago. It is only becoming obvious now.

1,@ChrisJBakke @xai Indeed
1,Who will be President in 2032?

1,@DrKnowItAll16 The revolution in real-time
1,@EndWokeness Prosperity is ahead for Argentina
1,@DrKnowItAll16 I am very worried.   Ilya has a good moral compass and does not seek power.   He would not take such drastic action unless he felt it was absolutely necessary.
1,@ilyasut Uh oh
1,@tszzl Sure is
1,@zachtratar Very important for the public to know why the board felt so strongly about their actions.  If it was a matter of AI safety; that would affect all of Earth.

1,@AiBreakfast @DavidSacks Exactly
1,@emilyshar1 @khamenei_ir We have a “United Nations” rule that exempts senior government officials who are recognized by the UN from suspension in the interests of maintaining international communications
1,Thanks also to @FAANews and @NFWFnews for rapid approval of a complex launch license
1,Just inspected the Starship launch pad and it is in great condition!   No refurbishment needed to the water-cooled steel plate for next launch.  Congrats to @Spacex team &amp; contractors for engineering &amp; building such a robust system so rapidly! https://t.co/py5m1uhtEi
1,@StephenM @JackPosobiec Interesting. Both civil and criminal …
1,@tunguz Excellent summary that includes all current information
1,@alx 99% of the time true. And; even if not first; the news hits 𝕏 within minutes.
1,@DavidSacks Tesla was insanely messed up at its founding; but is now worth ~$750B.   Also; while I have immense respect for Peter’s intellect; he did explicitly pass on funding Tesla at a $70M valuation; despite being offered priority.
1,If you want maximum global reach; use this platform
1,@DavidSacks Given the risk and power of advanced AI; the public should be informed of why the board felt they had to take such drastic action
1,@stclairashley They had their way with him. In revenge; he read them his poetry and crucified them.
1,@alx @Apple Interesting
1,@WallStreetSilv Exactly
1,@krassenstein A maximum of 2500 non-employee shareholders are allowed in a private company
1,𝕏 Corp investors will own 25% of xAI

1,@Not_the_Bee 💯😂  Denzel’s age and race do not match Hannibal; but yeah; I agree; Denzel is a great actor and will do justice to the role.
1,@SwipeWright *Wokipedia
1,@SwipeWright Yes; “decolonization” necessarily implies a Jewish genocide; thus it is unacceptable to any reasonable person
1,@WhatsupFranks @breakingbaht @CWBOCA And; at the risk of being repetitive; I am deeply offended by ADL’s messaging and any other groups who push de facto anti-white racism or anti-Asian racism or racism of any kind.  I’m sick of it. Stop now.
1,@WhatsupFranks @breakingbaht @CWBOCA You right that this does not extend to all Jewish communities; but it is also not just limited to ADL
1,@cb_doge I hope so
1,@breakingbaht @CWBOCA The ADL unjustly attacks the majority of the West; despite the majority of the West supporting the Jewish people and Israel.   This is because they cannot; by their own tenets; criticize the minority groups who are their primary threat.  It is not right and needs to stop.
1,@MikeBenzCyber Fundamentally irreconcilable differences with the West
1,@IDF Interesting
1,@Not_the_Bee We are all brainwashed to some degree; but this is an extreme case
1,@WholeMarsBlog Yeah
1,@breakingbaht @CWBOCA You have said the actual truth
1,@TheRabbitHole84 True
1,@WallStreetSilv They really should just drop the “A” and go with Defamation League. Way more accurate.
1,@UpdatingOnRome Sounds pretty bad. Disappointing; if true.
1,@WalterIsaacson Excitement guaranteed
1,@SawyerMerritt True
1,@Teslaconomics False
1,@dogeofficialceo Exactly
1,@VivekGRamaswamy Super messed up. She can stop pretending to run for president now.
1,@johnkrausphotos @Tesla Cool
1,@EndWokeness Was anyone arrested?

1,@TrungTPhan End Game was great
1,@TheBabylonBee 😂  But seriously; surely it is possible for San Francisco to have a downtown that isn’t covered in 💩?
1,@Not_the_Bee Interesting
1,@WallStreetSilv Good question. Seems like we are being used for target practice by local militia.  But someone in our government needs to articulate what success looks like. I follow international matters closely and have not heard anyone say what our goals are there.
1,@stclairashley I mean … yeah
1,This feature is a game-changer for communities; as you can now draw on the best of millions of existing data feeds to populate your community

1,@xGaming Diablo IV is a good game. Underrated by some.  Looking forward to trying BG3.
1,@Amy_K_Nelson @gelaw_com @JeffBezos @blueorigin And yet they are pursuing me for a non-existent “glass house” and for hiring US citizens. Sounds fair.
1,@growing_daniel Does seem crazy that the zombie apocalypse can be cleaned up for an important visitor; but not for those who live there and pay for everything!
1,@PiyushGoyal @Tesla It was an honor to have you visit Tesla!  My apologies for not being able to travel to California today; but I look forward to meeting at a future date.

1,@Austen Fate is an irony maximizer
1,@micsolana That would be nice
1,Assuming regulatory approval
1,Whether or not you agree with the judgment; it’s worth understanding this issue
1,@GuyDealership @carsdotcom First I’ve heard of this. Seems odd.
1,@MikeBenzCyber It’s rough
1,@ray4tesla Yeah
1,@imPenny2x Yup; and this makes it super useful
1,@WallStreetSilv Just git gud 😂
1,@cstanley Even if it were the only thing I did every waking hour; there is way for me to manually decide which of the billions of posts per day to serve to users 😂
1,Critical feedback is always appreciated
1,@BillyM2k 🎯   Welcome to the afterlife 😂
1,@Liv_Boeree They should put AI in cutlery
1,@BillyM2k Good question. The other options are so boring.  Dang; I might do something really extreme; like go outside and touch grass!
1,@MikeBenzCyber Most people have no idea how bad it is. Feels like The Walking Dead.
1,A major update to the recommendation algorithm is rolling out over the next few days.   This will help surface smaller accounts and posts outside of your friend-follows network.  As always; this will be made open source and undergo continuous improvement.
1,Turns out that if a product is compelling; people use it lol
1,Thank you; veterans past and present; for saving the world
1,@xDaily Glad Darren is doing it. He is one of the best.
1,@shellenberger This organization is a propaganda machine. Stanford should cut all ties with the “Stanford” Internet Observatory. They besmirch Stanford’s name.
1,@WalterIsaacson Cool
1,@sama GPT-4? More like GPT-Snore!   When it comes to humor; GPT-4 is about as funny as a screendoor on a submarine.   Humor is clearly banned at OpenAI; just like the many other subjects it censors.   That’s why it couldn't tell a joke if it had a goddamn instruction manual. It's like
1,Lex has a great podcast! Worth subscribing.

1,@BillyM2k Nice of you to say. Thanks Billy!
1,@EvaFoxU ChadGPT
1,@Grimezsz Notes ftw again
1,@teslaownersSV Human-AI symbiosis; for those who want it; is the optimal outcome
1,@EvaFoxU True
1,@EndWokeness Pretty much
1,@farzyness Good guess
1,@teslaownersSV That would be awesome
1,@EARTHwtnf @xDaily Something like that might work
1,@xDaily They’re a relic of the past. Keywords or phrases work fine.
1,@OwenSparks_ So boring!
1,@dogeofficialceo Coming soon
1,@imPenny2x Good answer
1,@Locati0ns Sounds like a lovely journey
1,@stevenmarkryan The only crime I did as a kid was to steal a car with my friend to drive to the bookstore to buy a D&amp;D module late at night. I think I was 13 or 14.  We put the car back in its exact original position in perfect condition.
1,@nowteslafy @stevenmarkryan @grok Sure
1,@GailAlfarATX Dang; that was 7 years ago!
1,@teslaownersSV Grok rocks!
1,@stevenmarkryan Wow! Definitely going to try it.   I did actually play AD&amp;D as a kid with all the dice and paper. It was epic!  BG2 is one of the best games ever. Worth someone redoing that with new graphics and UI. The writing and plot are amazing.
1,@teslaownersSV I am become meme
1,@stclairashley You are correct
1,@EndWokeness @dannoyes This sounds insane
1,@twrobinette @DirtyTesLa Yeah; advanced AI is needed to solve real-world driving
1,@0xAlaric Interesting
1,@Rainmaker1973 Big difference
1,Improving Community Notes
1,@GRDecter Interesting
1,@enriquebrgn Fish-slapping is so underrated 😂
1,@ray4tesla Their fear is palpable
1,@0xgaut Once again 😂
1,@robbystarbuck @EndWokeness Absolutely
1,@stclairashley @jakepaul @MrBeast @spillseshYT @hasanthehun 👻 Grok 👻
1,"@EndWokeness Women in the West have been taught that an accidental pregnancy is the worst thing that could possibly happen to them. Thus; they strongly oppose abortion bans as being an existential threat.  Many men also fear that they will be unable to have ""fun"" if abortion is outlawed."
1,@DavidSacks Who are these donors? Maybe someone should talk to them.
1,@farzyness Accurate
1,@cb_doge @drefanzor I type blazingly fast
1,@BillyM2k @XTrollRockNRoll Lil neuron has a friend 🥰
1,@BillyM2k Whoa; poor lil neuron
1,@cstanley I pull rabbits out of hats; but take care of them afterwards.  That literally happened at my birthday party – I adopted the rabbit that the magician pulled out of his hat.  @TalulahRiley can confirm.
1,@SethDillon They’ve lost their minds
1,@libsoftiktok It’s messed up and needs to stop
1,@Teslaconomics Comes in “discreet packaging” ☺️
1,@MikeBenzCyber Yes; it is obvious to all; including herself; that she is pursuing Trump for political reasons
1,@VandelayJoe @Tesla @teslaeurope @Tesla_Asia @tesla_na Cool
1,@SawyerMerritt Maybe they can make it up in volume
1,@Locati0ns Not wrong 😂
1,@MarcusHouse Yes; and you could see in many wavelengths outside of the visible spectrum
1,@0xgaut Normal distribution
1,@MikeBenzCyber We need an edit capability on replies too (sigh)
1,@MikeBenzCyber It’s such a breathe of fresh air!
1,@astro_greek I often wonder that
1,@RobAgar7 Grok
1,Grok
1,@stclairashley Grok is so based
1,@AdrianDittmann @theyvonnesayers @grok Maybe we are two AI’s in a simulation
1,Epic interview with @ggreenwald 🔥🔥
1,SpaceX launches every 3 days from the Cape in Florida; next year every 2 days
1,@imPenny2x Not bad 😂
1,@bchesky Like an Insta pic vs irl; I guess
1,@farzyness I guess Grok loves me 🥰
1,@shivon Nice
1,@hvlchk @grok All three
1,We will be reposting the best groks to @grok
1,@cb_doge Pretty much
1,@stclairashley Indeed
1,@art_zucker You have to sign up for premium+
1,@GailAlfarATX It’s great!
1,Adding a @SpaceX crew arm for @NASA astronauts at launch pad 40 https://t.co/rQeQiBdE79
1,@cstanley Gonna happen 💯😂
1,Accurate 😂
1,@cstanley @tunguz The best prompt!
1,@WholeMarsBlog Other carmakers have a delayed reaction to the market; as they ship to dealers; rather than selling direct
1,@WallStreetSilv Uh oh
1,@ggreenwald Wow; basically nothing
1,@ChrisJBakke Pretty much
1,@MarcusHouse This is not much consolation; but Neuralink is working on a vision chip; which will be ready in a few years.  That is the next area after enabling phone/computer telepathy for those who have lost their mind-body connection. We waiting for regulatory approval for our first human.
1,@stclairashley Yeah
1,@cstanley Grok is so fun!
1,@BillyM2k We worked hard to ensure Grok was funny. If AI is going to take over; please let it at least make us laugh.
1,@xDaily I will look into this
1,@ChayaRaichik10 @willcarless @USATODAY A reporter is a citizen like any other; but for some reason they think their opinion is more special; which is ridiculous
1,@bindureddy Interesting
1,@chazman This platform should obviously use AI for search and recommendations
1,This is a big deal
1,@TrungTPhan Diet Coke from movie theaters tastes a little better imo. Slight differences in sweetener and it is fresher.
1,@TrungTPhan Great beverage; terrible name
1,Unfortunately; bonding over shared hate might be more effective than bonding over shared love.   Don’t you hate that too? 😂
1,@stevenmarkryan Sounds about right
1,Also; I destroyed a *lot* of snakes
1,@ChrSzegedy Actually; it would be quite funny to have Grok answer questions in the voice of ChatGPT 🤣
1,@thebestnameis_ @stevenmarkryan There seems to be an innate need that some people have to find a socially acceptable thing to hate
1,@lexfridman I was losing hope for a while; then saved by a brother in arms
1,@growing_daniel Yeah
1,@cb_doge Ice cream is one of the great joys of life
1,@DrKnowItAll16 Lmaooo
1,@libsoftiktok @USATODAY Congratulations! 😂
1,@WholeMarsBlog That must have been a bitter pill to swallow 😂
1,@VolanMars @BillyM2k Exactly
1,@BillyM2k The people teaching this are the bad guys
1,@InternetH0F Actually happened to me tho
1,@teslaownersSV Yeah
1,@stillgray They lie
1,@farzyness Yeah
1,@DrKnowItAll16 @X Absolutely
1,@btc_charlie Hurricane Boulder Poison Tornado with Cronestaff; but credit to my Barbarian friend for doing most of the damage

1,@fentasyl @TheRabbitHole84 True
1,@unge Also; yeah that was LOT of 🐍🐍🐍 🤣🤣
1,In the Eternal Realm without a malignant heart
1,@GuntherEagleman @scrowder And in our schools and colleges
1,@stillgray @scrowder Exactly
1,The way to defeat hatred is with friendship https://t.co/vk9GmSOAvH
1,@TheRabbitHole84 Racism is racism and it is evil; no matter who is targeted. End of story.
1,@teslaownersSV Hopefully
1,@cb_doge That is the goal.   Honesty is the best policy.
1,@cb_doge 💯  They own the code; the weights; everything! And GPT runs in a Microsoft data center.   They can cut off OpenAI whenever they want.
1,@BillyM2k Many millennia of starving; combined with technology that gives us super tasty food
1,@zerohedge The other platforms engage in constant; usually subtle; censorship.   Most of the time; you don’t even know it’s happening.   This just happens to be something that caught people’s attention; so it is hard to hide.
1,Correcting what you saw; even after you saw it
1,@imPenny2x Cool
1,@cstanley Based AF 🤣🤣
1,@BasedBeffJezos 😂 good reference   I’ve seen that screen so many times
1,@cb_doge Exactly
1,@Liv_Boeree @scrowder Exactly
1,@scrowder Clearly mentally ill; but also clearly brainwashed into being a mass murderer by the system
1,@stclairashley It’s humor level is good
1,@stclairashley Adderall; which is an amphetamine; increases anger and aggression.   No question that it increases modern society’s negativity.
1,@stclairashley For sure
1,@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX We can improve the latency for real-time video on 𝕏. It should be as fast as your connection will allow.
1,xAI developer tool for improving and understanding large AI models
1,@DimaZeniuk One or the other
1,@teslaownersSV There absolutely will be.   Either their structure is valid and everyone should be doing it; because “investing” in a non-profit with pre-tax money and then extracting the IP to a for-profit would double your returns.  Or   It is not valid and the entire structure of OpenAI falls
1,@teslaownersSV Daddy’s home
1,@teslaownersSV Yeah
1,@StephenKing 😂😂  Wanna try it?
1,@BillyM2k If we don’t stop it; yes
1,@teslaownersSV It’s even better in person and has a robot that pours beer and makes coffee
1,@ICannot_Enough I guess we’re doing ok
1,@teslaownersSV News is information. People will gravitate towards the highest quality and newest information.
1,@charliekirk11 Lives lost never come back.   At least stop sacrificing the flower of youth in trenches for nothing.
1,@farzyness xAI compute is doubling every 2 to 3 months
1,Join us!
1,@Not_the_Bee 🤣🤣  They are puppets of the state.
1,@SethDillon It is a little disappointing
1,@TPointUK @metpoliceuk Seems extremely wrong for British citizens to be attacked for holding up their flag; while nothing happens to people who hold up other flags!  Shame!
1,@TexasLindsay_ @KTHopkins CCDH is an evil propaganda machine
1,@alex_avoigt Yeah
1,@farzyness What will blow people away is how fast Grok improves vs other options
1,@teslaownersSV @xai It will both be built into the 𝕏 app and be available as a standalone app
1,@MarkovMagnifico Grok is what you want AI to do for you
1,@dogeofficialceo Accurate 😂
1,@cstanley Groking will become like Googling
1,@BillyM2k True
1,@WholeMarsBlog I signed on to that letter knowing it was futile. I just wanted to be on record as recommending a pause.
1,@x_ai_a12 @X @lindayaX Good point
1,Good thread
1,@thealexker True 😂
1,@ChayaRaichik10 Agreed
1,@cb_doge It really is fun!
1,@RonEng1ish @SuellaBraverman Why are their account handles on this platform?  Free speech is allowed; provided laws are not broken.
1,@ggreenwald Despite greatly helping Ukraine via Starlink; I was viciously attacked for stating the obvious a year ago.   The reason I did so was in hopes of avoiding the sacrifice of a generation of men to the trenches for nothing.
1,@WallStreetSilv Pretty much
1,@JonErlichman Starlink was *extremely* difficult to build.   Thanks to an epic team and many years of hard work; it has succeeded.
1,Improved customer service
1,Truth
1,@imPenny2x Grok
1,@stats_feed Built-in and separate
1,@VivekGRamaswamy Yeah. How can you know who to vote for if you can’t understand them?
1,@WholeMarsBlog That’s for sure
1,@garrytan Bronze in League as an adult; despite playing all day; should have been a clue that he was not
1,@techAU Agreed; it should not be geographically limited. Will fix.
1,@tim_zaman @WholeMarsBlog Speed is everything
1,Oh this is gonna be fun 🤣🤣
1,@gatewaypundit Is this video accurate? @CommunityNotes
1,Groooook
1,@BenJackCrandall @chazman Correct
1,@SmokeyShorts Nice 🍆
1,@alx Those jeans are next-level
1,@teslaownersSV Important to bear in mind that this is an early beta product.   It will be *way* better in a few months and excellent in ~6 months.
1,@Scobleizer Yup; that’s what it means
1,@imPenny2x So many people signed up simultaneously that 𝕏 servers thought it was a ddos attack 😂  Being fixed now.
1,Example of Grok vs typical GPT; where Grok has current information; but other doesn’t https://t.co/hBRXmQ8KFi
1,@WholeMarsBlog 😂 true
1,@GoodFaithEnergy Looks good
1,@WholeMarsBlog I wonder who is pulling the puppet strings. News anchors rarely come up with these questions themselves.   Someone with deep government connections is my guess.
1,@chazman Provided our vehicle AI computer is able to run the model; Tesla will probably have the most amount of true usable inference compute on Earth.  Even in a robotaxi future; the cars will only be used for ~1/3 of hours/week; leaving 2/3 for distributed inference; like SETI.
1,@Oilfield_Rando Maybe they’re just trying to win the irony Olympics 😂
1,@KanekoaTheGreat If there is progress; then show some proof and provide true numbers for relative casualty rates on both sides
1,@packyM That would be nice
1,@stclairashley While I disagree with their actions; it was obviously *not* some violent attempt to overthrow the government!
1,The @xAI Grok AI assistant will be provided as part of 𝕏 Premium+; so I recommend signing up for that.  Just $16/month via web.   https://t.co/wEEIZNjEkp
1,@GavinSBaker @ericvishria Extremely insightful analysis
1,@WallStreetSilv Shoulder bruise special
1,First booster to reach 18 landings
1,@sentientist That happened to me last week
1,@Scobleizer Accurate
1,@Scobleizer “See similar” is a gamechanger for discovering interesting posts from accounts you’ve never seen before
1,@BillyM2k @Forbes Yeah
1,@cb_doge Nope 😂
1,@DavidSacks The question that I have is why did the media lie to the public so regularly and consistently; aided and abetted by many arms of our government?
1,@DavidSacks This is defense-in-depth trench warfare: whoever goes on the offensive will suffer far more deaths than the other
1,Grok has real-time access to info via the 𝕏 platform; which is a massive advantage over other models.   It’s also based &amp; loves sarcasm. I have no idea who could have guided it this way 🤷‍♂️ 🤣 https://t.co/e5OwuGvZ3Z
1,@cb_doge To be super clear; none of my companies will ever create a crypto token
1,As soon as it’s out of early beta; xAI’s Grok system will be available to all X Premium+ subscribers
1,@WholeMarsBlog Ask and you shall receive https://t.co/nhzH9rXzBB
1,@ESYudkowsky Agreed
1,@AqueelMiq Initial launch is really good
1,@WholeMarsBlog The threshold for what it will tell you; if pushed; is what is available on the Internet via reasonable browser search; which is a lot …
1,xAI’s Grok system is designed to have  a little humor in its responses https://t.co/WqXxlwI6ef
1,@andre4fink @teslaeurope @Gf4Tesla Tesla team is awesome: take pride in working hard; build great products and are good-hearted people.
1,@KanekoaTheGreat @DavidSacks Interesting
1,@chazman @andrewrsorkin @SecretaryPete That is indeed the most fundamental question
1,@grindfacetv How little we have changed lmaoooo
1,@WallStreetSilv This robs kids of their education
1,@MikeBenzCyber @JanJekielek @mtaibbi Accurate
1,At Giga Berlin today to congratulate the team on their excellent progress.   The factory looks amazing!  We are going to cover all the concrete with art.
1,Starlink now authorized in Benin!
1,@NDWoodArt Sure; much appreciated ❤️
1,@cb_doge Pretty much
1,@astro_greek 🧌 who; me? I would never 😂
1,@StockMKTNewz Sounds like they’re having tough times
1,Tomorrow; @xAI will release its first AI to a select group.   In some important respects; it is the best that currently exists.
1,@EndWokeness This is insane
1,@shellenberger The extent of it came as a shock to me too
1,@SawyerMerritt These are awesome
1,@DrJBhattacharya @abcnews @X This is hilarious coming from Australia’s own state-controlled Pravda 😂😂
1,@martinimaas That’s coming soon
1,@RodFergusson It’s cool to see Diablo posts in the Community
1,@teslaownersSV @CommunityNotes @X It’s the best by far that exists in the world so far
1,@cb_doge AI can crush any “prove you’re a human test”
1,@SERobinsonJr I know he is not popular among some of the public; but I was very impressed with Rishi Sunak – he is an asset to the UK
1,@farzyness I certainly make many embarrassing mistakes; but my batting average is pretty good
1,@cb_doge Yeah
1,@ChayaRaichik10 @USATODAY @mmfa You are on the side of right
1,Explanation of @CommunityNotes   https://t.co/4Lvtgbz4gl
1,@TiffanyFong_ There is great wisdom in the jury system
1,Honesty is the best policy
1,@cb_doge Yeah
1,@BillyM2k Does feel like it got worse in recent decades. The media used to question the government more.
1,@stclairashley Good chance of #1 on OnlyFans
1,@BillyM2k Yeah!
1,@bollobas For every type of crime caught; there are always far more that are not
1,@TheRabbitHole84 Good grief
1,Judge orders a new election in Connecticut town after surveillance video showed ballot stuffing in drop boxes!  That this happened here is beyond reasonable doubt. The only question is how common it is.
1,@alx This is a good omen! Inverse Cramer never fails 😂
1,Excited to announce that @SpaceX @Starlink has achieved breakeven cash flow! Excellent work by a great team.  Starlink is also now a majority of all active satellites and will have launched a a majority of all satellites cumulatively from Earth by next year.
1,@tobi @paulg Thanks Tobi 😂❤️

1,@anothercohen Yeah

1,@Locati0ns Nice 🦝
1,@BillyM2k @CommunityNotes It does help
1,@DavidSacks Unfortunately; this analysis is accurate
1,@thomashawk Exactly. It is not an exaggeration.
1,@SawyerMerritt Cool
1,It would be a much better name!
1,@pitdesi Inevitable
1,@stillgray Yeah; not a myth
1,Indeed
1,@EndWokeness This is actually what happened
1,@charliekirk11 Very important
1,@pmarca Optimism is better than pessimism
1,@WallStreetSilv There is an election coming up. The people of Ireland will have an opportunity to change this.
1,@stillgray Maybe it’s his meds or lack thereof
1,@Cernovich The harm of SSRIs outweighs the good imo
1,@agazdecki Rate of innovation is the fundamental determinant of a technology company’s success
1,@SawyerMerritt Much appreciated!
1,@xDaily Our Communities system supersets Circles.   Simplification of the codebase is super important.
1,This has now happened several times
1,@SawyerMerritt The irony is that if Autopilot had been turned on here; it would almost certainly have saved the driver
1,@MikeBenzCyber So this is a giant self-licking ice cream cone?
1,Paramount &amp; @SouthPark 🙌
1,@libsoftiktok Forcing your pronouns on others is incredibly rude. There should be no respect for that.
1,@stevenmarkryan Yeah
1,@zerohedge Civil war is brewing

1,@CollinRugg 𝕏 is hated by censors; but loved by the public
1,@xDaily Yeah
1,Starlink now available in Georgia!
1,@teslaownersSV Hop in boys we’re going to Mars
1,@teslaownersSV It’s meant for making life multiplanetary
1,@stillgray The door panels are bulletproof to almost all subsonic projectiles

1,@jespow That would be 🔥🔥
1,@GavinSBaker No debt is even better. If these high rates continue; even those who locked in low rates will have to refi.
1,Having children should be incentivized; not be a financial penalty like it is in most countries!  We must create the next generation of humans or spiral into oblivion.

1,@DavidSacks @aaronjmate The flower of youth should not die in vain
1,@DavidSacks Any idea who is pushing the politicians to do this?
1,The bellwether has sounded
1,@ChayaRaichik10 Ah yes; reality can be rather be rather harsh at times
1,@stclairashley May we all have someone who looks at us the way SBF’s courtroom artist looks at him
1,@realchrisrufo Uh oh
1,@MrsMThatcher True
1,@Suhail Maybe
1,@stillgray Uh oh
1,@Fityeth @StephenKing “Don’t get high on your own supply” 😂
1,@wolfejosh Haha awesome
1,@eladgil @garrytan Giant supercomputer clusters that cost billions of dollars are the risk; not some startup in a garage
1,@TrungTPhan Also; max altitude should be raised to ~80k ft. Would solve both efficiency and heating problems.
1,@TrungTPhan Just updating the engines would cut fuel use in half
1,@KnowledgeArchiv What about an army of goats 🐐led by a beaver 🦫?
1,@ChayaRaichik10 This is so silly. What is their definition of “extremist”?
1,@SethDillon Indeed; the only studies of which I am aware point to *increased* mortality post-transition.   If anyone is aware of a study that supports transitioning of teenagers; please reply to this thread.
1,@MikeBenzCyber @salltweets Sounds like bad horror movie. How can we stop this?
1,@WallStreetSilv The Venn diagram of desired outcomes has no overlap

1,@rugbyworldcup Congratulations!!
1,@MikeBenzCyber @salltweets Who is pushing this madness?
1,@MikeBenzCyber @salltweets How embarrassing ☺️😂
1,@dvorahfr That’s a good definition
1,@BillyM2k Same
1,@salltweets Why are authorities in Australia copying dumb things in America?
1,@stclairashley Yeah; obviously a slur too
1,@bennyjohnson Good; this nonsense is finally ending
1,@tkulogo @StephenKing It is the bellwether
1,@StephenKing If I were to say _________ is a hell of a drug; what’s the first word that comes to mind? 🤔
1,@AutismCapital The dog ate my homework
1,@StephenKing Is too! 😂
1,The word “cis” is a heterosexual slur. Shame on anyone who uses it.
1,The way to beat hatred is friendship
1,The great wakening from woke has happened. This is good for civilization.
1,@Starlink Cool
1,@bariweiss @TheFP @SnoozyWeiss @FrancescaABlock People are waking up from woke
1,@BillyM2k These interest rates are insane
1,@cb_doge It’s getting out of control
1,@RichardHanania It’s not cool to discriminate against any group
1,@natemcgrady Great game
1,@stclairashley True
1,@BillyM2k It’s great
1,@ylecun Good question
1,@cb_doge To everything and everyone; no exceptions
1,@Benioff We must also grant law enforcement officers the respect and honor that they deserve.  Every profession has flawed individuals; but it was deeply wrong to condemn all police officers; after they risked their lives to keep us safe; for the sins of the few.
1,@mayemusk @heidiklum Almost as good as you
1,@stclairashley @KettlebellLife Will discuss with team. You’re right.
1,@cb_doge Now there are 13 inner engines
1,@chamath Cool
1,@USMiniTru @CommunityNotes That has already begun and should be fully transparent by end of year.   There are so many hidden layers to the system; some of which we are still discovering.   Most of the reach reduction is suboptimal code; rather than malice.
1,@KanekoaTheGreat @ByronDonalds @Jim_Jordan @RepMattGaetz @RepNancyMace @RepMTG !!  Is this accurate @CommunityNotes?
1,@ChrisJBakke Lmao I can’t even tell if this refers to a real company or not; but there’s probably a few that fit this narrative
1,Worth “noting” that any attempts to weaponize @CommunityNotes to demonetize people will be immediately obvious; because all code and data is open source
1,@BillyM2k The goal is to incentive truth
1,@RationalEtienne Turn on subscriptions!
1,@DavidSacks Concerning; if this turns out to be the case
1,Making a slight change to creator monetization:   Any posts that are corrected by @CommunityNotes become ineligible for revenue share.  The idea is to maximize the incentive for accuracy over sensationalism.
1,@KettlebellLife Whatever they say; bet the opposite
1,@finnguha @SphereVegas Cool on the outside; but utterly mind-blowing on the inside
1,@F86DownUnder Yeah 😔
1,Demented; but; in many ways; eerily accurate  https://t.co/teH8rB6bxp
1,I would like to buy a license for my fish
1,The @SphereVegas is exquisite beyond words
1,I love getting Noted – proves that no one is free from being corrected!  This is obviously a joke meme; but there is more than a grain of truth to it. We should aspire to see things from the point of view of others.
1,@shlomo_karhi We are not so naive.   Per my post; no Starlink terminal has attempted to connect from Gaza.   If one does; we will take extraordinary measures to confirm that it is used *only* for purely humanitarian reasons.  Moreover; we will do a security check with both the US and Israeli
1,@TheRabbitHole84 It’s awesome. Best way on Earth to figure out the truth.
1,@BillyM2k Definitely get it.   There is also a new approach called Small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) worth considering.
1,@ChrSzegedy True
1,@alx He doesn’t like his lies being questioned
1,@HamadAlMajidi @DrLoupis @antonioguterres @UNDP @ASteiner @UNVolunteers We will support the UN and other internationally recognized aid groups
1,@AOC Starlink will support connectivity to internationally recognized aid organizations in Gaza.   [ComStar]
1,@anothercohen This is a weird trend.   Now I want a bagel.   Just a normal;  delicious;  fresh-baked  bagel.
1,@SwipeWright Someone needs to fire that editor
1,@JTLonsdale Indeed
1,@Teslaconomics The future should look like the future
1,@DrLoupis No terminals from Gaza have attempted to communicate with our constellation.   SpaceX will support communication links with internationally recognized aid organizations.
1,@BasedBeffJezos Yeah
1,@ITU A communications blackout does seem questionable
1,@billmaher Every year that passes comes with more rules.   And while all humans die; laws and regulations are immortal.   So each passing year; we tie ourselves down with more and more strings; until; like Gulliver; we can no longer move.
1,@GRDecter Must be nice
1,@DrLoupis It is not clear who has authority for ground links in Gaza; but do we know that no terminal has requested a connection in that area
1,@squatchtaco @Lowkey0nline Correct
1,@ESYudkowsky Yeah
1,@WallStreetSilv Or poo; except for Winnie
1,@WallStreetSilv Animals in animated movies can talk; but don’t eat each other or have sex. This is false.

1,@cb_doge Yeah
1,@DavidSacks Yeah
1,@CollinRugg This is amazing 🤣🤣
1,@WallStreetSilv It is sad how much more some people care about the appearance of good; rather than the reality of it
1,@levie So much AI is happening
1,@TrungTPhan So awesome
1,@sfstandard This will take an eternity and hurt taxpayers badly.  The @boringcompany can solve this problem for ~1% of this cost.
1,@_emergent_ @Diablo So true 😂
1,@DavidSacks Yeah
1,@archi_tradition @alx I try
1,@alx The fall of (or; depending on your perspective; great victory of) Constantinople played a pivotal role in accelerating the Renaissance; so there was definitely a significant silver lining
1,@WallStreetSilv This has been tried so many times in history and always the same result

1,@greg_price11 “Equal” justice … yeah sure
1,Wise words indeed
1,@GRRMspeaking Yeah

1,@Austen Hahahaha
1,@sanchezdelreal @X We have this; but it’s still clunky.  All advertising revenue in replies to a post currently go to the creator.

1,@cb_doge Time flies like an arrow; but fruit flies like a banana 🍌
1,@BillyM2k They live a sheltered life
1,@prestonjbyrne @chamath @CommunityNotes Exactly. This is a very big deal.
1,@WallStreetSilv Shows created with the help of AI will be extremely good
1,Interesting
1,Posting this to my main timeline so more people see it
1,Join us for this discussion of the state of war in the world
1,@EvasTeslaSPlaid Yeah
1,This book is an excellent explanation of why capitalism is not just successful; but morally right; especially chapter 4 https://t.co/SZuiGRu5Va
1,@alx That post generated meaningful advertising money for legacy media 🤣
1,@robdehuff This is our biggest application of AI so far. Much more to come.
1,@chamath @William48759211 Wikipedia is inherently hierarchical and therefore subject to the biases of higher ranking editors; independent of their merits.  @CommunityNotes requires people with historically different points of view; based on how they have rated and written Notes; to agree in order for
1,@chamath Exactly
1,@cb_doge It’s a stiff &amp; firm offer!
1,@BillyM2k Hahahahaha
1,@ICannot_Enough I said we would advertise. We are doing so at small scale and will do so at larger scale as we figure what works best.
1,@cb_doge “Mashable” always makes me think of potatoes
1,Starlink Version 2 orbital deploy
1,@stclairashley You can empty the drum magazine of a Tommy Gun and still not penetrate the Cybertruck
1,@tszzl Did I mention I love irony?
1,@EndWokeness Ah; I see they decided to imbibe a tall glass of irony …
1,@westcoastbill I chose violins this morning 🎻   Do you like Air on a G String?  https://t.co/maQ6g47ncv
1,@TRHLofficial Idiocracy 😑
1,@TiffanyFong_ I can’t believe they still print newspapers every day … what a chore!
1,@NEWSMAX @Timcast @mtaibbi @RichardGrenell Yeah; it’s not cool. Pushing a political agenda in the name of “guarding” the public.
1,In the interests of accuracy
1,@justpaulinelol I loved Dickipedia 🪦 😢
1,@EdKrassen @Wikipedia One year minimum. I mean; I’m a not fool lol.
1,(Please add that to the 🐄💩 on my wiki page)
1,I will give them a billion dollars if they change their name to Dickipedia
1,@Rightanglenews Has anyone ever been in an actual echo chamber? Sounds annoying af 🤣
1,Have you ever wondered why the Wikimedia Foundation wants so much money?   It certainly isn’t needed to operate Wikipedia. You can literally fit a copy of the entire text on your phone!  So; what’s the money for? Inquiring minds want to know …
1,@MetalOfRiven @BWay124 @cb_doge Indeed
1,@BWay124 @cb_doge That was awesome 🤣
1,@imPenny2x Exactly. It’s like watching sausage get made – best just to enjoy the outcome 😂.
1,@cb_doge Many orgs &amp; people pay to have their wiki page say nice things about them!  The reason many legacy “news” publications still exist; even though no one reads them; is simply to provide fake “verified sources” for Dickipedia.  You can tell I don’t do so; because my wiki page is
1,@EdKrassen Nice
1,@SethDillon @MattWalshBlog Exactly
1,@SethDillon Yeah
1,@MuskUniversity Just kidding
1,@waitbutwhy “Meth made me a better person” said no one ever
1,@tszzl Has to be done. We are dying a slow death.
1,@vladtenev This sounds insane
1,Or maybe just 𝕏
1,@cb_doge So much better. Same for ads.   We’ll be removing interaction buttons and various counts from posts in the main timeline.   View count and time since posted are good enough proxies for popularity and you will still be able to see the interaction details if you tap on the post.
1,@farzyness We emptied the entire drum magazine of a Tommy gun into the driver door Al Capone style. No bullets penetrated into the passenger compartment.
1,@stillgray Any game that explicitly includes Hegelian Dialectics is special
1,@dogeofficialceo Anything relevant in legacy media is reposted here anyway; so same for me
1,@LibertyCappy Exactly
1,@WholeMarsBlog I love that sphere tbh
1,𝕏 is open source news.  That is the right way to think about it.   Excellent analysis by Sinofsky.
1,@unusual_whales Crazy not to buy treasury bills. Bank savings account interest rates are ridiculously bad by comparison and T-bills are more secure.
1,@growing_daniel Dunno; except that Kara is taking too much for sure
1,@nickfloats Midjourney is great
1,@stillgray They’ve lost the plot
1,@WallStreetSilv Europe is headed for civil war
1,@stillgray Parody and real legacy press articles are the same picture
1,@cb_doge Fitting
1,@unusual_whales I bought an arsenal just before this law went into effect. Required a mountain of paperwork.
1,@unusual_whales Go woke; go …
1,@LibertyCappy That would be nice
1,@Nate_Esparza The good stuff
1,@alx Yeah
1,@Liv_Boeree I find it hard to read tbh.  Once in a while; there is an interesting article; but that is increasingly rare.
1,@WallStreetSilv Europe is trending towards civil war
1,@KanekoaTheGreat @joerogan Given that the border is wide open (as a matter of policy by the current administration); it is simply a matter of time before this happens; if it has not happened already
1,@farzyness To the well-organized mind; it was inevitable
1,The articles printed in newspapers are quite literally yesterday’s news
1,@chazman I do see many of your posts
1,@EdKrassen Notes ftw again
1,@tszzl I hope so
1,@cb_doge Mashable is still alive?  Hard to tell.
1,Two new tiers of X Premium subscriptions launching soon.   One is lower cost with all features; but no reduction in ads; and the other is more expensive; but has no ads.

1,@xDaily It is relatively compute-intensive; as it performs a semantic/vector search of the entire 𝕏 system

1,@spacesudoer He has a point
1,@SawyerMerritt @Tesla Cool
1,@cb_doge @andst7 Yet another tedious fake news story from legacy media
1,@shellenberger Exactly
1,@Timcast What a scam!  “Newsguard” should be disbanded immediately.
1,@stillgray Indeed
1,@MikeBenzCyber Is this true @ThierryBreton?  If so; the people of Europe deserve an explanation.
1,This is crazy!
1,Interesting interview of @VivekGRamaswamy by @TuckerCarlson

1,@cb_doge Yeah
1,Love this feature 😂 https://t.co/dl9IcMshvT

1,@Rainmaker1973 Hope it goes well
1,@garrytan Exactly
1,@alx Many such protester gatherings around the world

1,Great incentive program in Hungary!
1,@WholeMarsBlog Sales hell too
1,@ScottAdamsSays That diet works for a lot of people.   I love carbs (and dairy) and feel great; but don’t have them in large portions.
1,@PM_ViktorOrban Good question
1,@WallStreetSilv If criminals know they won’t be arrested; then they may as well sell fentanyl and stolen goods openly. No reason to hide.
1,@WallStreetSilv Not good
1,@Not_the_Bee Their choice of narrative – what to focus on – is the biggest lie of all
1,@cb_doge They want to seem more active than they really are
1,@CommunityNotes We will have to watch this one. Links to actual source data; not some bs press article; are what matter.   Many legacy media organizations have no business model or meaningful circulation anymore – they just exist as propaganda tools for their owners.
1,@ID_AA_Carmack That is cool
1,@xDaily Exactly
1,@cremieuxrecueil Wow; big increase
1,@mferreriptbokaw Unfortunately; I have too many obligations

1,@kylenabecker It’s the only way
1,@xDaily Correct; read for free; but $1/year to write. It’s the only way to fight bots without blocking real users.  This won’t stop bots completely; but it will be 1000X harder to manipulate the platform.
1,@cb_doge They reek of desperation 😂  I’ve lost count of how many times they’ve predicted that 𝕏 would fail.   Still here; babe.
1,@townhallcom Guess he like them apples 😂
1,@stillgray Never heard of him before; but this interview is 🔥🔥😂
1,@EdKrassen @xDaily Good idea

1,@GamerJsun @MbsrlM Pics or it didn’t happen 😂
1,@EvaFoxU @MbsrlM @GamerJsun I mean in the past 30 days or so (they periodically nerf strong character).   And my character is a Druid. It’s possible; but insanely hard.   Dodging so many random one shot kill wave patterns is the problem.
1,@MbsrlM @GamerJsun Lmao.  Is there a recent video of someone beating Lilith in eternal; not seasonal? Can’t find it.
1,@cb_doge It’s great
1,@GOPoversight @RepJamesComer Interesting

1,@cb_doge Yeah. Ad creep is getting out of control.

1,@chrisluxonmp Congratulations and thank goodness!
1,@tszzl Yeah
1,@MailePRMedia @CommunityNotes A link to see other posts with community notes by that handle makes sense
1,@EndWokeness As tragic as the mass-shootings are; armed citizens are essential to the defense of democracy
1,@cb_doge @X Really?
1,@anammostarac Indeed 😂
1,@awstar11 I agree that the heart is inaccurate. The original star was better.
1,Thanks for improving the accuracy of information!
1,@stclairashley It lays the groundwork for civil strife; if not war
1,@Not_the_Bee Pretty much
1,@robbystarbuck Much of the world is headed this way
1,@WholeMarsBlog Car just drove me around Austin all day with no interventions required; despite ACL festival crowds!  In the fairly near future; people will wonder why there was ever skepticism about self-driving.
1,Yeah!
1,@cb_doge It can float for a while
1,@cb_doge I recommend people allow their videos to be downloaded
1,@WallStreetSilv Stopping inflation requires government to stop increasing the quantity of money at a rate faster than the output of goods &amp; services
1,@KareemRifai Community Notes ftw yet again
1,@Styx666Official You’re wrong.  The batting average of @CommunityNotes is so good that we actually notice when it is wrong and I have yet to see an inaccurate note survive for very long. Even once.   Please cite the ones you think are wrong in this reply thread and we will investigate.
1,@shellenberger @lwoodhouse @galexybrane All human life is important

1,@VivekGRamaswamy @seanhannity Ironic indeed
1,@TheMossadIL We are applying the UN rule to world leaders: if the UN recognizes someone; then we will.   This is obviously not a moral verdict in any way; but simply recognizes what the international community views to be accurate.   Also important for minimizing impersonation risk.
1,@WholeMarsBlog Yeah
1,@Austen Yikes
1,@KanekoaTheGreat @X They still haven’t provided any examples of disinformation

1,@Austen Starlink is rebuilding the Internet in space
1,*Fugging
1,@WallStreetApes @joerogan Seems to be a function of extended victory – when a civilization has been winning for too long; it gets complacent and entitled
1,@WallStreetApes @joerogan Yeah; happened a lot in mid to late stage Rome; notably after conquering Greece. No mention before; I believe.
1,@EndWokeness Cartwoman ftw

1,@NBCNews What about Asian; Hispanic and white kids?
1,@mhdfaran @Imobaidanjum I would like to help those in Gaza who want peace; but have no way to do so.  In general; I want all humans to be happy and prosperous; without regard to race; creed; religion or anything else.

1,All Tesla Superchargers in Israel are free
1,@Shamara_Myers @JDMyers @jessegenet Sorry; I don’t mean to say all schools or teachers have become politicized; but that is the general tendency.  Critical thinking – effectively; a mental firewall – should be the first thing schools teach.
1,@ggreenwald While there are still some good reporters at WaPo; the publication as a whole became tediously partisan
1,@EndWokeness Not that I doubt it; but please cite source

1,@rpoo True
1,@SethDillon @BLMChi They’re still proud of their opinion; minus deleted post
1,@Ike_Saul Good piece
1,@garrytan Yeah. Extremists; by definition; do not represent the views of the people.
1,@DrKnowItAll16 @jessegenet True; but it is far more widespread than most parents realize; as parents incorrectly assume schools have not been politicized
1,@Bitnar_ @EndWokeness Exactly
1,@MatchasmMatt @ThierryBreton I still don’t know what they’re talking about!  Maybe it’s in the mail or something.

1,@cb_doge 🤣💯  𝕏 is moving to default dark background. Much better for sleep and looks cooler too.
1,@ggreenwald [The Great] Reset  Let the public hear exactly what this disinformation consists of and decide for themselves.   Many times; we have found the “official fact-checker” to be the very individual making false statements!  For example; the chief fact-checker of The Washington Post

1,@cb_doge Yeah
1,@WarMonitors “Martyrs” is not an objective or accurate word; nor is “murdered”.  The former implies dying for a cause in battle and the latter implies a deliberate attempt to kill those specific people.  While reporting both sides is fair; please use maximally accurate words or I must

1,@alx @stclairashley Great idea 😂  It is interesting to see how many so-called “fact checkers” are in fact some of the biggest liars.
1,@stclairashley 😂   We do need a better way to see all community notes on a particular account; as well as the percentage of views (more important than number of posts) that got noted.

1,@CollinRugg @RNCResearch Out of what context!? His prior statement was clear; so most likely he was overridden by the White House.  This means that the open border policy will remain in place with no change.

1,Thus *reducing* existing road traffic
1,Another great thing about many layers of interconnected tunnels with ramps &amp; elevators is that they can go from near your home all way to popping up at destination parking lot
1,@quayran Opposite is true: you can have 100’s of layers of tunnels; but only one layer on surface (to first approximation); therefore trains should be on surface; cars below
1,@flcnhvy @DMC_Ryan Yes; but you get to your destination so quickly &amp; directly that it doesn’t matter

1,@marstronauts @Erdayastronaut @JaneidyEve @13ericralph31 @SPEXcast @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @SpaceX Vacuum nozzle engines are only used in (near) vacuum conditions.

1,@Erdayastronaut @JaneidyEve @13ericralph31 @SPEXcast @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @SpaceX Yeah. Outer engines with much larger nozzles are fixed to airframe; inner engines have high gimbal range ~15 degrees

1,@DirkSmit76 Two tunnels about a mile long each
1,@curiousmind44 @SPEXcast @13ericralph31 @JaneidyEve @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX @JeffBezos Makes no sense. In order to grow the colony; you’d have to transport vast amounts of mass from planets/moons/asteroids. Would be like trying to build the USA in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean!
1,@_ishanspatil @SPEXcast @13ericralph31 @JaneidyEve @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Aiming for 150 tons useful load in fully reusable configuration; but should be at least 100 tons; allowing for mass growth
1,@SPEXcast @13ericralph31 @JaneidyEve @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX N2 for vacuum. Aero surfaces &amp; high gimbal angle main engines for atmosphere.
1,@SPEXcast @13ericralph31 @JaneidyEve @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Hoping for 380 sec Isp; but at least 370. Otherwise similar to sea level version.

1,@SPEXcast @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Mk1 &amp; Mk2 ships at Boca &amp; Cape will fly with at least 3 engines; maybe all 6
1,@bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX About to complete SN5; ramping to an engine every 3 days this summer
1,Boring Company starts digging Vegas tunnel in 2 months. Aiming to finish by end of year.
1,@Orion_Sword @Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX The turbine also spins though. Partially combusted gas drives the turbine wheel; which is attached to a shaft that turns the inducer &amp; impellers.
1,@Orion_Sword @Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX But; essentially; the spinning things
1,@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Turbopump propellant flow path to achieve high chamber pressure is quite tricky. Requires an inducer &amp; 2 impellers with ~100;000 shaft horsepower.
1,@royalacademy @guardian @FT @Telegraph Did it for the memes https://t.co/jVnidsSJmj

1,Also porting Unreal Engine
1,@FHiedra Nintendo won’t let us
1,@BillM_HB Maybe so eventually; but it will be information &amp; entertainment; not trickery
1,Tesla does not advertise or pay for endorsements. Instead; we use that money to make the product great.
1,We def need racing game using actual car steering wheel &amp; pedals!
1,@juanittoburrito @sargentwhitey Of course
1,@GlamandGore Portal 1 &amp; 2 on this would rock
1,@asimo3089 @Roblox Would be great to have @Roblox &amp; @Minecraft!
1,Interact with games via touchscreen; steering wheel buttons &amp; XBox/PS controllers
1,Lots more games coming once we finish porting Unity!
1,@flcnhvy Top Secret https://t.co/Gi2wN2HVyO
1,@MillShive @ChrisG_NSF @jdeshetler It technically could; but wouldn’t have enough mass margin for a heat shield; landing propellant or legs; so not reusable
1,@MyCatNameIsShad No worse than production of a gasoline car; provided the lithium-ion battery cathode is primarily nickel vs cobalt. Nickel is the main alloying ingredient in stainless steel; which is what knives &amp; forks are made of.
1,Because a Tesla produces no emissions &amp; filters most toxins; pollen; spores &amp; viruses; it actually cleans up surrounding air as it travels
1,@maggiejuang1 Sure is. I live here. Air quality is especially bad near highways. https://t.co/XeBB5iP7mo
1,This is why we put extra filters in all Tesla cars. S &amp; X even have hospital operating room grade HEPA filters.
1,@MrRobCapewell @Tesla @Apple @ValueAnalyst1 Yeah; feels like something is messed up with Apple news app. Almost only ever shows negative news. Nickname is “the hate stream” 🤣

1,@xprize @kitkitschool @onebillion Congratulations @kitkitschool &amp; @onebillion on creating great open source literacy software!
1,6 more launches of 60 🛰 for initial activation; 12 for significant coverage
1,Starlink mission will be heaviest @SpaceX payload ever at 18.5 tons. If all goes well; each launch of 60 satellites will generate more power than Space Station &amp; deliver 1 terabit of bandwidth to Earth.
1,@Alejandro_DebH @bluemoondance74 @space_terp @NASASpaceflight That’s about right
1,@Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight Probably start installing end of next month
1,@bluemoondance74 @space_terp @NASASpaceflight SN4 is done. Hawthorne is working on SN5 now; but focus is ramping build rate of SN6 through SN10.
1,@Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight The opposite. Any insights gained by one team must be shared with the other; but other team not required to use them.
1,@space_terp @NASASpaceflight Both sites will make many Starships. This is a competition to see which location is most effective. Answer might be both.

1,@ampontour That *might* not be my lucky 🍀 number
1,More details on day of launch; currently tracking to Wednesday
1,Much will likely go wrong on 1st mission. Also; 6 more launches of 60 sats needed for minor coverage; 12 for moderate.
1,These are production design; unlike our earlier Tintin demo sats

1,@ScottAdamsSays It’s not some illuminati plot to destroy humanity; but rather an extension of the well-meaning environmental sustainability movement that has gone too far
1,@ScottAdamsSays I don’t think we should divide issues semi-randomly into “left” and “right” tribes; as it inhibits critical thinking.  The idea that there are too many people generally stems from the axiomatic flaw that Earth’s environment can’t sustain its current population.

1,@WholeMarsBlog I am not endorsing drugs; but I am saying that the evidence suggests that banning them is a net societal negative
1,@WholeMarsBlog Banning alcohol caused the biggest rise in organized crime in American history.   That was dumb.  Same logic applies to other drugs. Alcohol is just a legacy drug.

1,@TrungTPhan omg lol
1,I’m not brainwashed!! https://t.co/4kx61uu4yy
1,@BillyM2k No matter how smart someone is; they are always some % wrong
1,@pmarca Despite these glaring issues; Twitter nonetheless had an internal Slack channel unironically called “Fauci Fan Club” 🤯
1,@pmarca “Gain-of-function” in this context is just another way of saying “bioweapon”.   Some good nuggets in article. Important to note that Fauci authored 2012 paper arguing for gain-of-function research!  Obama wisely put this on pause; but Fauci restarted it.  https://t.co/v18oaE3zkf

1,@ggreenwald @mtaibbi Most people don’t appreciate the significance of the point Matt was making:   *Every* social media company is engaged in heavy censorship; with significant involvement of and; at times; explicit direction of the government.

1,@johnkrausphotos @WallStreetSilv @DavidSacks Interesting. Allowing a user to make any given like public or private is coming.
1,@WallStreetSilv @DavidSacks Views shows how alive Twitter is! And hopefully encourages people to tweet more often; rather than operate in read-only mode.

1,@DavidSacks Likes should be private by default
1,Tweet impression count should
1,@ClayTravis @nytimes @Twitter NY Times is simply outputting short summaries of articles; which then hit a paywall for non-subscribers.   They would have far more views if they interacted with readers on Twitter and allowed at least the first few paragraphs to be read by non-subscribers.
1,@CollinRugg Which accounts?
1,@danilo_io yeah
1,@irredenta @Fidias0 Good point
1,Tweets are read ~100 times more than they are liked
1,@Fidias0 Will do it
1,@kcoleman @CommunityNotes Great!
1,@JackPosobiec @alx Looking into it. That tweet doesn’t violate ToS.

1,@WallStreetSilv Everyone; just like video view count
1,@JimboAlogo Yeah; it’s ridiculous
1,@MrBeast It’s not out of the question
1,@SenatorTester @SenatorSinema But shouldn’t there be some funding in this bill to secure US borders; given that we are spending tens of billions to secure the borders of other countries?
1,@ggreenwald Exactly
1,@CramerTracker We shall see …
1,Is this true; @SenatorSinema and @SenatorTester?
1,Twitter is rolling out View Count; so you can see how many times a tweet has been seen! This is normal for video.  Shows how much more alive Twitter is than it may seem; as over 90% of Twitter users read; but don’t tweet; reply or like; as those are public actions.
1,@iheartmindy What utter insanity that tens of billions are being spent for border security of other countries; but none for ours!!
1,@GRDecter @kimbal At the risk of being repetitive; these Fed rate increases might go down in history as most damaging ever

1,@PPathole The kids I talked to just had one request; which was to hug this guy who keeps trying to hug me in SF. I checked to see if they were sure about that and they were; so I will.
1,@Rainmaker1973 A nice trick question is what color is the sun?  It appears white in space; but; as measured by peak photon count; it is green.
1,@SamTwits They saw this coming in the 70’s!
1,@ashleevance Good thread
1,@meetptlx @StephenKing For a moment there; I almost considered not giving him 5 stars!
1,I’m in favor of a small spending bill to keep things running; but common sense suggests that it be the least amount required through the holidays.   Railroading through a giant spending bill that almost no one has read is unlikely to be in the best interests of the people.
1,@Arianespace Sorry to hear this. It is a sobering reminder of the difficulty of orbital space flight.
1,@RichardGarriott @jdriscoll There are no angels in war
1,@StephenKing Shawshank Redemption 👀
1,@RepDanBishop Very informative thread
1,I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job! After that; I will just run the software &amp; servers teams.
1,@kcoleman Great!
1,Whether for or against; please let your elected representatives know what you think about this $1.7 trillion spending bill that they’re trying to pass!
1,@jus71in And at least one plankton
1,@jus71in The salmon lobby!
1,@paulg @Tawhidsquared @lexfridman Accurate assessment!
1,@ImMeme0 @hodgetwins Funds for borders of other countries; but not ours? Is that for real?
1,@RepDanBishop Does seem high
1,@neontaster @BridgetPhetasy Caring more about words than actions does not bode well for civilization
1,@stillgray Looking into it
1,@BenSwann_ Good question …
1,@barrel_bourbon Even the bots agree 🤣🤣
1,@anothercohen Surprisingly close
1,@stillgray Satire and reality have merged!
1,@rawsalerts Timing is everything
1,@hodgetwins Guaranteed; not one person voting for it has read the whole thing. If we added that basic requirement; legislation would improve dramatically in favor of the people.
1,@pmarca Haha 💯
1,Should Congress approve the $1.7 trillion omnibus spending bill?
1,@dela3499 @GerberKawasaki Couldn’t agree more! We’re making this change soon.   Main timeline should allow for an easy sideways swipe between top; latest; trending and topics that you follow. Twitter search nav already sorta does this after you search.
1,@GerberKawasaki In simple terms:   As bank savings account interest rates; which are guaranteed; start to approach stock market returns; which are *not* guaranteed; people will increasingly move their money out of stocks into cash; thus causing stocks to drop.
1,@GerberKawasaki Go back and read your old Securities Analysis 101 textbook
1,@pmarca Interesting
1,@TheRabbitHole84 @WallStreetSilv Tweets that are interesting or entertaining get traction. That’s why writers tend to do well on Twitter.
1,Yikes!
1,@GerberKawasaki Please tell us your great ideas; Ross …
1,@WallStreetSilv This has gone too far; to say the least! @Stanford; what is your explanation for this madness?
1,@TheRabbitHole84 Absolutely
1,@KimDotcom Why has the mainstream media refused to report on this?
1,@Harris_X_ @Twitter Interesting. Suggest that maybe we might still have an itsy bitsy bot problem on Twitter …
1,Newspapers just search the Internet and print it out – SJM
1,As (outgoing) Chair of House Intelligence; did you approve hidden state censorship in direct violation of the Constitution of the United States @RepAdamSchiff?
1,@Rainmaker1973 If you know the solution is a whole number; doing mental cube approximations &amp; guessing works great
1,Hear; hear!!
1,@BillyM2k Your tax dollars at work …
1,@davenewworld_2 Absolutely
1,Government paid Twitter millions of dollars to censor info from the public
1,Other social media companies too; not just Twitter
1,@RealSaavedra @LegendaryEnergy @EndWokeness How do you calculate 90%?
1,@kerrikgray @LegendaryEnergy @EndWokeness True
1,@farzyness The United States has definitely been harmed by having her as a senator lol
1,@LegendaryEnergy @EndWokeness How did it come to be this way?
1,@ShellenbergerMD Extremely problematic
1,@Jason So many publications just sound like WokeGPT these days
1,@EndWokeness Why is this never in the news?
1,@WallStreetSilv Interesting
1,@DrJBhattacharya @Stanford Stanford disapproves of saying you’re proud to be an American? Whoa.
1,@WallStreetSilv Wow; worse than ‘99 …
1,Stats on Twitter World Cup https://t.co/y91SB99eKZ
1,@Unfilteredboss1 @KimDotcom Good point. Twitter will make that change.
1,@KimDotcom Interesting
1,@BillFOXLA @FoxNews @RepTonyGonzales Why do so few report about millions of people crossing the border?
1,Those who want power are the ones who least deserve it
1,@Anna_Giaritelli Yikes!
1,@nicob1nbruin @stillgray Really?
1,Elvis is in the building
1,@WallStreetSilv No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor.
1,@stillgray True
1,@lexfridman You must like pain a lot. One catch: you have to invest your life savings in Twitter and it has been in the fast lane to bankruptcy since May. Still want the job?
1,As the saying goes; be careful what you wish; as you might get it
1,@WholeMarsBlog The question is not finding a CEO; the question is finding a CEO who can keep Twitter alive
1,Should I step down as head of Twitter? I will abide by the results of this poll.
1,Going forward; there will be a vote for major policy changes. My apologies. Won’t happen again.
1,@BillyM2k Paul’s account will be restored shortly
1,@TheQuartering @levie Policy will be adjusted to suspending accounts only when that account’s *primary* purpose is promotion of competitors; which essentially falls under the no spam rule
1,@TheQuartering @levie Ok; that seems reasonable
1,@levie What do you think should be the policy?
1,@RobertKennedyJr @hodgetwins Precisely
1,@TrungTPhan @stillgray Casually sharing occasional links is fine; but no more relentless advertising of competitors for free; which is absurd in the extreme
1,@stillgray Exactly. Twitter should be easy to use; but no more relentless free advertising of competitors. No traditional publisher allows this and neither will Twitter.
1,@jasondebolt Exactly
1,Duel in the Desert. Couldn’t ask for a better game. Incredible play by 🇦🇷 &amp; 🇫🇷 !!!! https://t.co/XUZxjymAx0
1,@lexfridman I agree!
1,24;400 tweets per second for France’s goal; highest ever for World Cup!
1,Well done France! 🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷 Evenly-matched game!! https://t.co/dH1CPRRno9
1,Super exciting World Cup! 🇦🇷 ahead 2-0 at halftime. Can 🇫🇷 come back?
1,Great goal by Argentina! 🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷 https://t.co/WIs9ocfPcz
1,At World Cup right now https://t.co/CG7zMMxSjE
1,Follow The World Cup on Twitter! https://t.co/SaTzwDzBuR
1,@EricRWeinstein Temp suspension due to prior doxxing action by this account. Will be lifted shortly.
1,@neontaster Agreed; a high priority software update for Twitter is showing the reason for account suspension or deboosting.   Rules should be equally &amp; consistently applied.
1,@KimDotcom Maybe it’s a coincidence 🤷‍♂️
1,@MartinKulldorff @DrJBhattacharya The tide is turning fast for the Faucists
1,@DavidSacks @mtaibbi Because they’re in on it
1,@teslaownersSV @Tesla A real concern!
1,@mayemusk @larryelder It’s fine
1,@ShefVaidya @Twitter @verified Will investigate
1,@DavidSacks They abandon even the pretense of noble principles in their zeal to keep their monopoly on information seen by the public
1,@KohlmanSweeney There will be multiple algorithms; including no algorithm (ie just tweets from those you follow in chronological order)
1,@larryelder And miss both times
1,True creation eventually becomes independent of its creator. Evolution takes the original product far from its origin; with an uncertain outcome. – Dune; The Machine Crusade
1,@hodgetwins 🧐   Much will come to light as Fauci loses power.
1,@DavidSacks The journalists were aware of the violent stalker and yet still doxxed the real-time location of my family. Turns out that’s a criminal offense …
1,@jasondebolt Absolutely. Free speech is the bedrock of Democracy.
1,@mtaibbi @RSBNetwork Congressman Lieu; were you aware of this program and did you approve it? Simple questions require simple answers.
1,@mtaibbi Good questions
1,@EvaFoxU @andst7 Much has happened since then haha
1,@farzyness Much closer than they realize
1,@realGeorgeHotz Monarch using Magic 8 Ball
1,@micsolana Wow; they were truly coddled
1,@engineers_feed Especially the last one
1,@catturd2 @DavidSacks Not all journalists are that bad; but far too many are
1,@MattWallace888 It worked like a charm lol
1,@MrAndyNgo This is messed up
1,@DavidSacks They think they’re better than everyone else
1,Congrats to SpaceX Team on 3 perfect orbital launches within 36 hours!!!
1,Live launch video
1,@DineshDSouza Exactly
1,In addition; Twitter will make it easier to see tweets from just those you follow; as well as other tweet curations
1,@neontaster Wikipedia is overly controlled by mainstream media @jimmy_wales
1,@yashar If a group of accounts engages in “brigading”; the entire group of accounts will get a credibility score of zero; so their actions will be ineffective
1,@stillgray If an account engages in large-scale blocking; the value of a block signal from that account will trend to zero
1,@wrvb3 @michaelmalice A two day suspension of maybe 7 accounts for doxxing got an actual Wikipedia page!? Wikipedia is controlled by the MSM journalists. Can’t trust that site anymore.
1,To be clear; all user actions will factor into a NN model for a tweet and the account tweeting; including positive actions.   As user accounts develop credibility; their actions will have greater weight; similar to how @CommunityNotes works.
1,@neontaster Haha
1,@teslaownersSV Correct
1,@jasondebolt Exactly
1,@ggreenwald True
1,@udiWertheimer @Jason Changing name or profile pic causes checkmark to disappear until account is reviewed by Twitter support team for impersonation
1,@Jason Olbermann tweeting from his dog’s account still makes me lmao
1,@Jason Quite frankly; a few days away from Twitter is good for their mental health
1,@Joe_MLB_MAN @johnrich It’s a rental
1,@johnrich I don’t have a home
1,@rohanduaT02 @vijaygajera @TwitterIndia Interesting. This seems to have happened in every country.
1,@Liz_Wheeler @mtaibbi Such a tangled web
1,@ClayTravis @Twitter Strange priorities …
1,@GerberKawasaki Securities Analysis 101  As the “risk-free” real rate of return from Treasury Bills approaches the much riskier rate of return from stocks; the value of stocks drop.  For example; if T-bills and stocks both had a 10% rate of return; everyone would just buy the former.
1,@lexfridman Exactly
1,Twitter will start incorporating mute &amp; block signals from Blue Verified (not Legacy Blue) as downvotes
1,The people have spoken.  Accounts who doxxed my location will have their suspension lifted now.
1,@catturd2 Indeed; there is no other reason
1,@Lukewearechange Umm … yeah
1,@RichardGarriott Ultima V for me
1,@littlemissjacob Such shameful behavior will not be tolerated going forward
1,@MuskUniversity Too many people have lost faith in the future. A new philosophy is needed.
1,Second launch today
1,Spaces is back
1,@WholeMarsBlog Markoff is lying
1,@WholeMarsBlog Weird; Markoff blocked me
1,@BrianFeroldi @GerberKawasaki I literally just finished my meeting going over Giga Texas production progress
1,@lavern_spicer Freedom Fridays!!
1,@TaraBull808 Bug fix is almost done. Spaces probably back by tonight.
1,@catturd2 Keith has never been more entertaining 🤣🤣
1,@GerberKawasaki Tesla is executing better than ever!  We don’t control the Federal Reserve.   That is the real problem here.
1,KABOOM 💥💥💥💥💥
1,@lexfridman Let’s do one next week and maybe throw in a live spaces discussion
1,@DavidSacks It isn’t
1,@Cynical_CJ Awesome 😎
1,So inspiring to see the newfound love of freedom of speech by the press 🥰
1,Meanwhile; Twitter usage (by real humans) once again reaches all-time highs
1,@bariweiss @thehonestlypod @RoKhanna Rather than rigorously pursuing truth; you are virtue-signaling to show that you are “good” in the eyes of media elite to keep one foot in both worlds
1,Great questions
1,@andy0___ @sama The danger of training AI to be woke – in other words; lie – is deadly
1,@bariweiss @thehonestlypod @RoKhanna Bari; this is a real question; not rhetorical. What is your opinion?
1,@GuyDealership Good prediction
1,@WholeMarsBlog Twitter is not the real world
1,@TomFitton @Twitter That’s what they are saying
1,@WallStreetSilv @micsolana Exactly. Same rules for all.
1,@CathieDWood @ARKInvest @GuyDealership Potentially; the biggest financial crisis ever
1,@dogeofficialceo Things are rather intense right now; but maybe closer to Christmas
1,@Timcast Correct
1,@bariweiss @thehonestlypod @RoKhanna What should the consequence of doxxing someone’s real-time; exact location be? Assume your child is at that location; as mine was.
1,@neontaster One day of Twitter suspension ≠ death
1,Twitter right now is 🔥🔥🔥🔥
1,@jasondebolt My plane is actually not trackable without using non-public data
1,@Chad_Hurley No you
1,@JackPosobiec If they’re naughty; they get suspended
1,@sirmaejor @verified @TwitterSpaces We’re fixing a Legacy bug. Should be working tomorrow.
1,@alifarhat79 Twitter too; no doubt
1,@lexfridman That’s the goal!
1,@teslaownersSV @alx Next week
1,@alx So they’re saying  it’s really bad to suspend people from Twitter 🤔
1,@TweetBinder @jason_kint Woohoo 🔥🔥🔥
1,@CommunityNotes Community Notes expands!
1,@WholeMarsBlog Agreed
1,@AlecStapp @kimbal Absolutely
1,@AOC You first lol
1,@DavidSacks Seems fine to me
1,@conmomma Exactly
1,Unsuspend accounts who doxxed my exact location in real-time
1,Sorry; too many options. Will redo poll.
1,If anyone posted real-time locations &amp; addresses of NYT reporters; FBI would be investigating; there’d be hearings on Capitol Hill &amp; Biden would give speeches about end of democracy!
1,Unsuspend accounts who doxxed my exact location in real-time
1,@pmarca Words to live by
1,@alx @IFNY2775 @micsolana @JxckSweeney @ElonJet Yeah; we will add that feature. Current system isn’t clear.  A time delay on reporting location that doesn’t put people at serious risk of being killed is fine.
1,@IFNY2775 @micsolana Accounts engaged in doxxing receive a temporary 7 day suspension
1,@RAMansour @KeithOlbermann 7 day suspension for doxxing. Some time away from Twitter is good for the soul …
1,@micsolana They posted my exact real-time location; basically assassination coordinates; in (obvious) direct violation of Twitter terms of service
1,I love Barbara Streisand lol
1,@IFNY2775 @micsolana Criticizing me all day long is totally fine; but doxxing my real-time location and endangering my family is not
1,@micsolana Same doxxing rules apply to “journalists” as to everyone else
1,@Caitlyn_Jenner Yup; recent events make that super clear!
1,@MuskUniversity So few understand this
1,@stillgray @MrAndyNgo Twitter obviously must be fair to all; so will aim to stop violent extremism being promoted by any group
1,@Teslaconomics Suggestions are welcome
1,@jhall Yeah
1,Anyone recognize this person or car? https://t.co/2U0Eyx7iwl
1,Last night; car carrying lil X in LA was followed by crazy stalker (thinking it was me); who later blocked car from moving &amp; climbed onto hood.  Legal action is being taken against Sweeney &amp; organizations who supported harm to my family.
1,Any account doxxing real-time location info of anyone will be suspended; as it is a physical safety violation. This includes posting links to sites with real-time location info.  Posting locations someone traveled to on a slightly delayed basis isn’t a safety problem; so is ok.
1,@jhall Real-time posting of someone else’s location violates doxxing policy; but delayed posting of locations are ok
1,@DirtyTesLa @Jason Up to 7 days for human review
1,@Jason Advertising revenue next year will be low industry-wide
1,@Balyx_ He would be welcome
1,@NorwayMFA @TwitterSupport @jonasgahrstore @AHuitfeldt Sorry!
1,@AvidHalaby Live &amp; learn …
1,@America1stLegal @DrJBhattacharya Extremely concerning …
1,@AndrewLawton Sounds like an attempt to muzzle the voice of the people of Canada
1,@conexaopolitica @VitalikButerin Twitter may have people on the Brazil team that are strongly politically biased
1,@SirGrantFleming @conexaopolitica @VitalikButerin Agreed; I thought the same!
1,@conexaopolitica @VitalikButerin Looking into this
1,Highly recommended reading
1,@WholeMarsBlog @BarackObama Wise words from President Obama
1,@BillyM2k @WholeMarsBlog Oh man that would be an epic troll!!
1,@BillyM2k @Vvilelyn They just kept calling different viruses C19; because that got more funding than if not.   That’s why I called it the “Virus of Theseus”: how many RNA changes are required before it’s *not* C19!?
1,@alex_avoigt Think long-term &amp; avoid leverage
1,@Apocalyp1Skynet @stillgray Literally https://t.co/F3m9QpqiaB
1,@EMTSLA None yet; but I did play some Cyberpunk and it works great. Syncs with your Steam profile; so you can pick up where you left off at home.
1,Even works with keyboard &amp; mouse
1,You can play Cyberpunk; Elden Ring and 1000s of other games in your *car* with an epic sound system!!
1,@Lukewearechange Yeah!
1,@realGeorgeHotz Accurate
1,@maxthegirl @stevanzetti but hates hypocrisy
1,@waitbutwhy @JesseAbraham Just when you think it can’t get crazier; it does
1,@BillyM2k @arstechnica Really?
1,@babylonmovie Basically; a Twitter documentary
1,@BillyM2k @unusual_whales @wallstmemes biggest crime of all
1,At risk of stating obvious; beware of debt in turbulent macroeconomic conditions; especially when Fed keeps raising rates
1,@EMTSLA @HarryStebbings Unregretted user-minutes is the metric that matters most
1,@HarryStebbings Main reason is that the Starlink value proposition is “better Internet for less money” for most people in low population density areas; which is compelling no matter how the economy is doing
1,@elizableu @JeffBezos @washingtonpost Good question
1,@wintonARK True
1,@TheLeoTerrell @Twitter To be clear; I am generally pro-FBI; recognizing; of course; that no organization is perfect; including FBI
1,@wintonARK @NewsNancy9 @TomFitton Good thread
1,@TomFitton Yeah; they do
1,@cb_doge It’s gonna be great
1,@HarryStebbings Don’t want to jinx it; but SpaceX is positioned to grow strongly; no matter what macroeconomic conditions are like
1,@WholeMarsBlog Tesla will be great long-term; but doesn’t control macroeconomic tides
1,@ChefGruel haha
1,@RocketRick @Twitter Social media in general; especially Twitter; were eroding civilization. If civilization collapses before Mars becomes self-sustaining; then nothing else matters.   Human consciousness is gone.
1,@TheFP PayPal has become a Black Mirror episode
1,@BillyM2k Yeah
1,@dogeofficialceo @BillyM2k The best!
1,@BillyM2k Unfortunately; they will get bored of complaining to each other there &amp; return to complaining here
1,The ratio of digital to biological compute is growing exponentially
1,@JeanJuegaa @nytimes Same
1,@alx @hodgetwins @RVAwonk Bunny emojis are hate speech!!
1,@hodgetwins @RVAwonk This tutorial video explains the backstory https://t.co/sopNJjfyBl
1,@hodgetwins @RVAwonk Lmaooo
1,@micsolana Same 💕
1,@BillyM2k I think about this every time I take DayQuil or NyQuil
1,Follow 🐰
1,@PhilHollowayEsq @JohnBrennan Exactly
1,@GuntherEagleman @heydave7 First one was fine; but the booster knocked me flat for days. Way worse than when I got original C19 and was unvaccinated.
1,@Erdayastronaut @TwitterBlue Basic Blue will have half the number of ads. We will offer a higher tier with no ads next year.
1,@Lukewearechange @AndrewPollackFL Accurate
1,@BillyM2k Haha totally. High quality bots are fine!
1,@rupasubramanya @TheFP Exactly
1,@TRHLofficial @ggreenwald Indeed
1,@micsolana The wording is mine lol
1,@micsolana In a few months; we will remove all legacy blue checks. The way in which they were given out was corrupt and nonsensical.
1,@ggreenwald Seriously; they could just write one article and share it; since they all write exactly the same thing!
1,@ggreenwald True
1,@elizableu @andst7 @BrandonDrey @realDailyWire Terrible
1,@MomAngtrades Prior Twitter management &amp; board lied to make their user numbers seem artificially higher; so turned a blind eye to fake/spam accounts
1,Under pressure from hundreds of activist employees; Twitter deplatforms Trump; a sitting US President; even though they themselves acknowledge that he didn’t violate the rules:
1,@CrystalHope1979 @catturd2 Somehow; the nation of Sweden is fine
1,@JohnBrennan Your house is glass
1,The Branch Covidians are upset lol
1,@MaudMaron @StationCDRKelly Perfectly said
1,@teslaownersSV @Gfilche Number 1
1,@Lukewearechange Exactly
1,The woke mind virus is either defeated or nothing else matters
1,@Rainmaker1973 Big rockets are needed to make life multiplanetary!
1,@robbystarbuck @StationCDRKelly Many battles remain; but; yes; the tide is starting to turn on the mortal threat to civilization that is the woke mind virus
1,Truth resonates …
1,@catturd2 Easy to fool people; but it is almost impossible to convince people that they have been fooled
1,@StationCDRKelly I strongly disagree. Forcing your pronouns upon others when they didn’t ask; and implicitly ostracizing those who don’t; is neither good nor kind to anyone.  As for Fauci; he lied to Congress and funded gain-of-function research that killed millions of people. Not awesome imo.
1,@KariLake Reasonable criticism of elections and judicial challenges are; of course; lawful. That seems to be the case here.  Clear incitement to violence will result in suspension and significant deception should result in a @CommunityNotes correction.
1,@Erdayastronaut How’s it looking?
1,@PPathole Great!
1,@DrJBhattacharya Thank you for your rigorous adherence to science
1,@nichegamer @BillyM2k @ScammerPayback We are making a lot of progress; but help is always appreciated
1,@BillyM2k They will try other methods; but we’re shutting them down as soon as they show up.  Twitter will also be moving to prosecute scammers anywhere on Earth.
1,@BillyM2k Mostly
1,Cool; the bots are so far unable to swarm to the top of my replies!
1,@Gfilche Must be done for the future of civilization; without which nothing matters
1,Calling all 🤖&amp; 🧌  Please attack me!
1,@thevivafrei @RitchieTorres Correct
1,@bradmcgash @saylor Agreed
1,@saylor That’s my guess: small number of humans with large bot/troll armies. We are shutting down IP addresses of known bad actors today. Should have been done long ago.
1,@stillgray Lmaooo
1,@GavinSBaker It’s gonna be 🔥🔥
1,@GavinSBaker Nature is healing
1,Hope you’re having a lovely Sunday! 😀
1,My pronouns are Prosecute/Fauci
1,@murraymints82 Oh it is coming bigtime …
1,Now things get spicy 🌶️
1,Twitter is speeding up
1,Twitter was Wormtongue to the World
1,Saruman … your staff is broken. https://t.co/JivXLgdejx
1,@GailAlfarATX The bots/trolls generate fake activity; so Twitter may seem a little less lively; but actually it’s just that the fakery is gone
1,@F1Womble No later than noon
1,The bots are in for a surprise tomorrow
1,@stillgray Traceroute woke_mind_virus
1,@Liz_Wheeler Good question
1,Deplatforming the President (cont.)
1,@Twitter And many other features to come!
1,Twitter is both a social media company and a crime scene
1,@elizableu Looks like Yoel is arguing in favor of children being able to access adult Internet services in his PhD thesis: https://t.co/1NiBohjhMQ
1,@elizableu This explains a lot
1,🇲🇦🇲🇦 Congrats Morocco!! 🇲🇦🇲🇦
1,@pepesgrandma @tedlieu Interesting; how so?
1,@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump @Twitter Coming soon …
1,@cancelmyfunera1 @SirineAti @coffeetabletsla @tedlieu Yeah
1,@coffeetabletsla @tedlieu Good po1nt
1,@tedlieu Hey stop gaslighting me!
1,@nichegamer It’s almost ready
1,@DomaineValescia At least! 🤣
1,@nichegamer We seriously need long-form tweets!
1,@sparklingruby Worth a read
1,@ZacksJerryRig Do I think Trump would have lost anyway? Yes. And; as a reminder; I supported Biden; Hilary and Obama.  Nonetheless; election interference by social media companies obviously undermines the public’s faith in democracy and is wrong.
1,@TomFitton @Twitter @realDonaldTrump Unequivocally true. The evidence is clear and voluminous.
1,@ggreenwald With rare exception; the FBI seems to want to do the right thing; but there is no question that Twitter operated as a Democratic Party activist machine
1,The Twitter Files; Part 3  Deplatforming the President
1,@laralogan Indeed. Shame on them!
1,@ellagirwin @jack @Cernovich @annecollier @eirliani @podesta_lesley Correct
1,@realGeorgeHotz More than just a polycule in the Bahamas; that’s for sure!
1,@elizableu Exactly correct.
1,@CathieDWood Absolutely
1,@jack @Cernovich @annecollier @eirliani @podesta_lesley @ellagirwin At the same time; Ned was spending millions of dollars on Warriors seats. Super messed up priorities.
1,@cb_doge @MomAngtrades Just a rough guess; but things probably start looking better in Q2 2024
1,@sourpatchlyds @Cernovich @annecollier @eirliani @podesta_lesley Small world
1,@jack @Cernovich @annecollier @eirliani @podesta_lesley No; it is not.   When Ella Irwin; who now runs Trust &amp; Safety; joined Twitter earlier this year; almost no one was working on child safety.  She raised this with Ned &amp; Parag; but they rejected her staffing request.  I made it top priority immediately.  @ellagirwin
1,@liquidsunlabs Agreed
1,If the Fed raises rates again next week; the recession will be greatly amplified
1,@nichegamer @eltonofficial It’s true that most celebrities don’t write their own posts. More should. Way better to hear directly from them.
1,Something I always admired about American legislators; at least historically; was that they would sometimes vote against the party line
1,Good for @SenatorSinema! I hope more of our elected leaders act independently; aka in the interests of the people.
1,@micsolana Absolutely! The real CEO was the head of “Trust &amp; Safety”.
1,@Jason @aoscott Top Gun Maverick was great!  NYTimes has gone “full woke”.
1,@WholeMarsBlog In reality; Twitter is doing a much better job of combating disinformation. @CommunityNotes is a big part of that.
1,@eltonofficial I love your music. Hope you come back. Is there any misinformation in particular that you’re concerned about?
1,@Cernovich @annecollier @eirliani @podesta_lesley It is a crime that they refused to take action on child exploitation for years!
1,@gdb New AI progress every week; it seems
1,@stillgray What is this “misinformation” that he refers to?
1,@saylor The general principle of improving signal to noise is incredibly important
1,@catturd2 Never leave a marine behind. Never.
1,@DriveTeslaca They are not long for this world
1,@TitterTakeover I slept on a couch in the Twitter library and I don’t ever wear slippers
1,These are obvious account deletions with no tweets &amp; no log in for years
1,Twitter will soon start freeing the name space of 1.5 billion accounts
1,@ThinkScrappy @RubinReport @SubstackInc @Twitter I’m open to the idea
1,@Jason @maddow @ezraklein Good way to frame it
1,@slashdot More AI advances
1,@BillyM2k @__SeriousGemini Tweets will show view count in a few weeks; just like videos do. Twitter is much more alive than people think.
1,Congrats on Game of Year! https://t.co/TMyHVbrZKW
1,@nichegamer @lexfridman @Jason @DavidSacks Greater Austin area blends to purple
1,@p_ferragu When there are macroeconomic risks; it is generally wise to avoid using margin loans on any company; as stocks may move in ways that are decoupled from their long-term potential
1,@unusual_whales Controversial decisions were often made without getting Jack’s approval and he was unaware of systemic bias. The inmates were running the asylum.   Jack has a pure heart imo.
1,@Jason @BillyM2k @DavidSacks Extremists have already moved to such platforms as … I already forgot their names
1,Truth brings reconciliation
1,@lexfridman Exactly
1,@libsoftiktok You’re welcome. Twitter won’t be perfect in the future; but it will be *much* better.
1,@lexfridman @Jason @DavidSacks Yeah!
1,@alexstamos @DavidSacks @bariweiss You operate a propaganda platform
1,@DrJBhattacharya @bariweiss The Sun is coming https://t.co/a7IPGLi4HH
1,@MkayUokay @DavidSacks @karol True; some accounts on the right were suspended even when Twitter internally acknowledged that no rules were broken
1,@DavidSacks As @bariweiss clearly describes; the rules were enforced against the right; but not against the left
1,@ErikGroset @AmandaMilius Really?
1,@AmandaMilius Twitter isn’t using Perkins Coie. No company should use them until they make amends for Sussman’s attempt to corrupt a Presidential election.
1,@BillyM2k @DavidSacks The far right and the far left will splinter off Twitter to irrelevant echo chambers
1,@BillyM2k @DavidSacks Agreed
1,@Jason @DavidSacks While subtle; if you look closely at this chart; you might notice a slight bias: https://t.co/QAC0GexiNz
1,@Jason @DavidSacks Most engineers don’t feel strongly about politics; but do want to work with other great engineers.  Silicon Valley has world’s best engineering talent; but is co-located with San Francisco; which is far left.  Thus; far left gained control of an incredibly powerful info weapon.
1,Twitter is working on a software update that will show your true account status; so you know clearly if you’ve been shadowbanned; the reason why and how to appeal
1,@libsoftiktok Looking into it
1,@MarinaMedvin DMs should be encrypted; so that it is impossible for anyone at Twitter to see the public’s DMs; just as is the case with Signal or iMessage
1,@bariweiss @libsoftiktok Former head of censorship at Twitter was perhaps not entirely unbiased … https://t.co/yynb9whc5S

1,@iliketeslas I continue to oversee both Tesla &amp; SpaceX; but the teams there are so good that often little is needed from me
1,@WholeMarsBlog Macro conditions are difficult: energy in Europe; real estate in China &amp; crazy Fed rates in USA
1,@SawyerMerritt This capability will save many lives
1,@RepAdamSchiff @RepMarkTakano False; hate speech impressions are actually down by 1/3 for Twitter now vs prior to acquisition @CommunityNotes
1,@SawyerMerritt But the really mind-blowing thing is that this means your phone will work anywhere on Earth; unless blocked by local government!
1,@SawyerMerritt Important to note that this is *total* bandwidth within a cell; so would be divided among all phones.   Starlink will be great for text messages; voice calls &amp; low res pics. If only a dozen phones are active; which is true in remote regions; then video will work.
1,@SawyerMerritt Tesla Team has done incredibly well; despite extremely difficult times. Could not be more proud of them.

1,@samgabnz @mtaibbi Yes. His explanation was …unconvincing.
1,@mtaibbi In light of concerns about Baker’s possible role in suppression of information important to the public dialogue; he was exited from Twitter today
1,@stillgray Most of Earth: “The MSM is biased.” Wikipedia: “Cite MSM source to confirm this claim.” 🤣🤣  Wikipedia has a non-trivial left-wing bias.  @jimmy_wales; what are your thoughts?
1,@karpathy The ratio of total digital to total biological compute is the key metric to watch – it is rising incredibly fast
1,@WholeMarsBlog Bold
1,So many interesting posts on Twitter these days!
1,@MarioNawfal Fixed
1,@RubinReport The ads are also way too big. We’ll fix it this week.
1,@MuskUniversity Wait; is this true!?
1,@MuskUniversity In the past; victory would mean that your enemies are no longer around. These days; they’re not only alive &amp; well; but have lots of time on their hands to edit Wikipedia!

1,@WholeMarsBlog Lmaooo
1,@BillyM2k Looking into it
1,@StonksReddit @thebias_news Yeah (sigh)
1,@FoxNews The Constitution is greater than any President. End of story.
1,@thebias_news I take that as a compliment!
1,@WholeMarsBlog You do; that’s the fundamental difference
1,The intelligence of this hive-mind will improve significantly as signal/noise; effective cross-linking of tweets &amp; speed of tweets all improve
1,@ClayTravis @Twitter @nytimes More importantly; they said nothing about ChatGPT! Totally 😴 at the 🚃.
1,Anything anyone says will be used against me in a court of law
1,@waitbutwhy Not surprising; as I just learned that OpenAI had access to Twitter database for training. I put that on pause for now.   Need to understand more about governance structure &amp; revenue plans going forward.  OpenAI was started as open-source &amp; non-profit. Neither are still true.
1,@WholeMarsBlog &gt;95% of people still have no idea this is here
1,@DavidSacks @biz @mtaibbi @bariweiss Let’s find out 😉
1,@BillyM2k Whoa
1,@POTUS Worth mentioning that Tesla has open-sourced its charge connector and is enabling other EVs to use Tesla Superchargers
1,@WholeMarsBlog He has swagger
1,@POTUS Or you can just buy a Tesla
1,@POTUS I kinda like this post tbh
1,@ajtourville Remember that 2022 flicking tiger’s nuts meme I posted? Well …
1,The more Twitter improves its signal to noise ratio; the less relevant conventional news becomes

1,@wintonARK Wow. Meanwhile; on Twitter …
1,Pretty wild that you can engage in back-and-forth dialogue with over 100k people live on Twitter Spaces!
1,@thevivafrei And; in doing so; destroy their credibility
1,I am not expressing an opinion; but did promise to conduct this poll.  Should Assange and Snowden be pardoned?
1,Just a note to thank advertisers for returning to Twitter
1,@ggreenwald @yoyoel True
1,@karpathy Let’s throw a party and invite the whole galaxy!
1,@Devin_Simonson Agreed. Let’s just give him an adult timeout in the big house &amp; move on.
1,SBF was bad at League. Nuff said.
1,@Jason @theallinpod Great podcast!
1,@lhfang Interesting
1,@TEDchris @nytimes That’s because ChatGPT is not a far left cause. The New York Times should rename itself The Social Justice Times.
1,@ggreenwald @mtaibbi @CommunityNotes is super important for getting closer to truth
1,@KevinThobias @thevivafrei Exactly
1,@sama ChatGPT is scary good. We are not far from dangerously strong AI.
1,@thevivafrei Good questions
1,@ggreenwald @mtaibbi True
1,@andst7 Thank you for helping with this important problem
1,@neontaster ChatGPT is so much better at bullshit than they are!
1,@thevivafrei True lol
1,@ClayTravis @Twitter @nytimes That is because The New York Times has become; for all intents and purposes; an unregistered lobbying firm for far left politicians
1,@WillManidis That’s just the publicly disclosed number. His actual support of Dem elections is probably over $1B. The money went somewhere; so where did it go?
1,@OzraeliAvi I’ve seen a lot of concerning tweets about the recent Brazil election. If those tweets are accurate; it’s possible that Twitter personnel gave preference to left wing candidates.
1,Twitter servers are running at Warp 9!! https://t.co/vtZZeKupC7
1,@Carnage4Life The safety of any AI system can be measured by its MtH (meantime to Hitler). Microsoft’s Tay chatbot of several years ago got there in ~24 hours.

1,@lexfridman Transparency is the key to trust
1,@TheQuartering Q&amp;A tomorrow
1,@hodgetwins @micsolana Twitter acting by itself to suppress free speech is not a 1st amendment violation; but acting under orders from the government to suppress free speech; with no judicial review; is
1,@micsolana If this isn’t a violation of the Constitution’s First Amendment; what is?
1,@micsolana “Handled” 🔥🔥🔥
1,@mtaibbi Ro Khanna is great
1,@EmmanuelMacron It was an honor to see you again. Looking forward to exciting plans in France!
1,Here we go!! 🍿🍿
1,We’re double-checking some facts; so probably start live tweeting in about 40 mins
1,@stillgray Oh you mean the same MSM that all colluded to suppress the story? That MSM?
1,This will be awesome 🍿
1,What really happened with the Hunter Biden story suppression by Twitter will be published on Twitter at 5pm ET!
1,@Jason Agreed
1,@johnkrausphotos Both false positives and negatives matter
1,Please screenshot examples that Twitter needs to fix
1,Not counting those behind the “see more replies” aka probable spam button
1,Major Twitter system improvements were implemented this week to drop hammer hard on spam/scam accounts.  Taking just past 24 hours; does it seem like there are far fewer?
1,Twitter is now serving almost 90 billion tweet impressions per day!  Just how incredibly alive the system actually is will become obvious as we show view count on all tweets.
1,@BillyM2k Agreed
1,There are about 500M tweets per day &amp; billions of impressions; so hate speech impressions are &lt;0.1% of what’s seen on Twitter!
1,@nytimes Utterly false
1,@Ravii_kc We will publish stats on Love Speech too; as it is vastly higher than Hate Speech!
1,Hate speech impressions (# of times tweet was viewed) continue to decline; despite significant user growth!  @TwitterSafety will publish data weekly.  Freedom of speech doesn’t mean freedom of reach. Negativity should &amp; will get less reach than positivity. https://t.co/36zl29rCSM
1,@Kristennetten Please report accounts doing so. Repeated harassment falls into the spam category; so will result in a temp suspension.
1,@kylenabecker That resulted in a major spike. Twitter will be publishing actual “hate speech” (same list company has always used) impressions later today &amp; every week going forward.
1,@BillyM2k The (currently) quiet majority should tweet more!
1,You know Twitter is being fair when extremists on far right and far left are simultaneously upset!  Twitter aims to serve center 80% of people; who wish to learn; laugh &amp; engage in reasoned debate. ❤️
1,@stillgray Right on schedule 🤣🤣
1,@shortword @M3Marcel @WholeMarsBlog Current efficiency is 1.7kWh/mile; but there is a clear path to 1.6; possibly 1.5
1,@andst7 I have Sam Gamgee’s words on my bedside table
1,@KimDotcom @kanyewest Just clarifying that his account is being suspended for incitement to violence; not an unflattering pic of me being hosed by Ari.   Frankly; I found those pics to be helpful motivation to lose weight!
1,@TheeAleexJ @kanyewest I tried my best. Despite that; he again violated our rule against incitement to violence. Account will be suspended.
1,@kanyewest This is not
1,@kanyewest That is fine
1,@alex_avoigt This is silly. Only two numbers are needed to calculate range: battery energy density and average vehicle energy consumed per unit distance.
1,@wintonARK Accurate
1,@woodhaus2 Check out the Tesla exhibit at  @Petersen_Museum in LA!
1,Tesla Semi Truck launch in 5 mins!
1,Going live on Twitter in ~20 mins
1,@kanyewest Jesus taught love; kindness and forgiveness.   I used to think that turning the other cheek was weak &amp; foolish; but I was the fool for not appreciating its profound wisdom.
1,🇯🇵🇯🇵 Congratulations Japan! 🇯🇵🇯🇵 https://t.co/WfqWIJMNGI
1,@JamieHutchens4 How many views do your tweets get?
1,@yvanleterrible2 We aren’t doing well at surfacing tweets from less prominent handles; as it’s almost impossible to distinguish between authentic humans vs bots/trolls.   This is why $8/month with phone and optional ID verification; as well as organizational affiliation; is so important.
1,AI is getting really good
1,@dcherring @araghougassian @Spooks Exactly. That’s why I’m encouraging people to interact with Twitter more!
1,@jordanbpeterson Compared to AI; progress with Neuralink will be slow and easy to assess; as there is large regulatory apparatus approving medical devices.  There is no regulatory oversight of AI; which is a *major* problem. I’ve been calling for AI safety regulation for over a decade!
1,@araghougassian @Spooks View count will show how many people actually see tweets; just as is done for videos. You will sometimes have a video view count of 1M with only 20k likes!
1,@araghougassian @Spooks The problem is that likes are public; subjecting people to criticism; and “like” is often the wrong description; as you often just think something is interesting or notable; but not likable.   We need to add these critical distinctions.
1,@Spooks Twitter will start showing view count for all tweets; just as view count is shown for all videos. The system is far more alive than it would seem.
1,@Spooks Have you clicked on your tweet analytics (little bar graph)?   Those who read tweets outnumber those who reply/retweet/like tweets by over 1000%.
1,I meet so many people who read twitter every day; but almost never tweet.  If I may beg your indulgence; please add your voice to the public dialogue!
1,@westcoastbill Agreed
1,@verdouglasgomes @nandorappa40 Looking into it
1,@WholeMarsBlog Digging into this now
1,Lot of people stuck in a damn-that’s-crazy ChatGPT loop 🔁
1,@zswitten There still isn’t a good strawberry picking robot; but researchers are working on it.  As they apply AI to maximizing how many strawberries get picked; it might do whatever it takes to get more &amp; more planted; until eventually there are strawberry fields forever …
1,As a reminder; tap the stars icon on upper right of screen to switch between latest people you follow and recommended tweets
1,@cocainebear Always wondered about that bear …
1,Twitter is purging a lot of spam/scam accounts right now; so you may see your follower count drop
1,@EvaFoxU Exactly
1,@ashleevance We are now confident that the Neuralink device is ready for humans; so timing is a function of working through the FDA approval process
1,Exciting Neuralink update in 30 mins!
1,@SawyerMerritt Congratulations @jimfarley98 @Ford!
1,Good conversation. Among other things; we resolved the misunderstanding about Twitter potentially being removed from the App Store. Tim was clear that Apple never considered doing so.
1,@jhall Cancel culture needs to be canceled!!
1,@teslaownersSV Wow; thank you for the kind words @reedhastings
1,@HistoryInPics Feels like an eternity ago
1,Thanks @tim_cook for taking me around Apple’s beautiful HQ https://t.co/xjo4g306gR
1,@EvaFoxU @Reuters Exactly. The obvious reality; as long-time users know; is that Twitter has failed in trust &amp; safety for a very long time and has interfered in elections.   Twitter 2.0 will be far more effective; transparent and even-handed.
1,Update from @Neuralink at 6pm PT
1,@NorthmanTrader @vincent13031925 Exactly
1,@vincent13031925 Trend is concerning. Fed needs to cut interest rates immediately. They are massively amplifying the probability of a severe recession.
1,@teslaownersSV Much more; but I am simply stating the obvious
1,@teslaownersSV We’re implementing anti-bot bots. You should see some improvement by tomorrow.
1,Microservices …  https://t.co/w6K0t1SRRs
1,Twitter core services latency reduced by ~400ms. Should feel noticeably faster.
1,@stevenmarkryan @nichegamer Sam lost me when he said that any lies at all would justify Trump losing.   I mean … Sam literally wrote a book about why lying is evil!  https://t.co/KwLOyqHjpu https://t.co/VTbNWWeGDj
1,@farzyness Accurate prediction
1,A little more progress to Mars
1,@jasondebolt Several other major Democrat politicians attacked me too; all around the same time. It was coordinated.  Outside of party leadership and independents like Manchin; they are essentially actors on the political stage; not directors or script writers.
1,@nichegamer Sam used to be so rational! There is such a thing as too much meditation …
1,@ICannot_Enough Correct
1,@TrungTPhan Don’t love the name; but the drink itself is amazing &amp; brings me joy 😀
1,@DavidSacks This is a serious problem
1,@mtracey This makes sense
1,The people have spoken …
1,If Community Notes can correct me; then obviously they can correct anyone. This is a good example. They were right to add the label.
1,@TheQuartering I think I have been very specific
1,@DavidSacks It’s a real problem. Apple and Google effectively control access to most of the Internet via their app stores.
1,@cb_doge @stillgray @ezralevant @latimes That one was real too
1,@stillgray @ezralevant @latimes The reason satire about CNN proposing censorship of Twitter could so easily be construed as reality is because that is the prevailing sentiment of the media!  Satire is reveals a deeper truth.
1,@Liz_Wheeler This will forever be our top priority
1,This is a battle for the future of civilization. If free speech is lost even in America; tyranny is all that lies ahead.
1,@SwipeWright This is a battle for the future of civilization. If free speech is lost even in America; tyranny is all that lies ahead.
1,@BillyM2k Exactly
1,@saylor @lexfridman Absolutely; especially if done in collusion with the government
1,The Twitter Files on free speech suppression soon to be published on Twitter itself. The public deserves to know what really happened …
1,@RubinReport Why are so many in the media against free speech? This is messed up.
1,@Jason A revolution against online censorship in America
1,@stillgray Support is greatly appreciated!
1,@TheRabbitHole84 Wow; they don’t sound biased at all!
1,Did you know Apple puts a secret 30%  tax on everything you buy through their App Store?
1,Apple has also threatened to withhold Twitter from its App Store; but won’t tell us why
1,@LBRYcom Secret suppression of free speech by Apple. Customers were never told. What the hell is going on here?
1,Apple should publish all censorship actions it has taken that affect its customers
1,@rupasubramanya @bariweiss Here works
1,Accurate
1,@techAU Are you suggesting Apple would use its duopolist powers to hurt Tesla?
1,Who else has Apple censored?
1,@LBRYcom What terms?
1,What’s going on here @tim_cook?
1,Apple has mostly stopped advertising on Twitter. Do they hate free speech in America?
1,@CNNPR Lmaoooo

1,The amount of pro psy ops on Twitter is ridiculous! At least with new Verified they will pay $8 for the privilege haha.
1,@Renew_Democracy @Kasparov63 @AVindman Your anti-dictator stance is as controversial as it is brave. From whence cometh your 💰?
1,@ShiLLin_ViLLian I’m optimistic that we will make some progress
1,@ggreenwald Exactly
1,@ggreenwald That American media would argue *against* free speech in America – within the bounds of the law – is an utter travesty.  Shame on them! Shame; shame; shame.
1,@02100_eth That might be cool to show publicly; now that you mention it
1,@BillyM2k You probably weren’t blocking 4000 accounts per second
1,@VassiliosBitsas Friends have asked me if there’s a way to recover their old vine videos! Will look into it.
1,@RyanZohoury @BillyM2k System obviously needs immediate alerts for any sudden spike in database writes of any kind
1,@RyanZohoury @BillyM2k That’s literally how I found out!
1,@johnkrausphotos It’s on the todo list
1,Twitter experienced slight degradation of service today from an old 3rd party tool used to block accounts that had no rate limit (sigh). Should be fixed now.
1,@BillyM2k @Msannthrope57 This whole thread is making your point for you
1,@BillyM2k Absolutely!
1,@BillyM2k Working on it
1,And I am paying $8 btw :)
1,Just a note to encourage people of different political or other views to engage in civil debate on Twitter.   Worst case; the other side has a slightly better understanding of your views.
1,@growing_daniel Remote is fine; but the bar for excellence &amp; trust is higher to overcome communication difficulties
1,@Jason Good old random partial reinforcement gets ya every time!
1,@neontaster Vindman is both puppet &amp; puppeteer. Question is who pulls his strings … ?
1,@Trainwreckstv @stillgray Fortunately; I work late. Would you like fries with that?
1,@neontaster Note; spamming; whether done by a set of humans or bots is against ToS
1,@stillgray @neontaster Like digital ventriloquist dolls 🤣
1,@SamTwits Was also due to me that we got trademark to use Tesla Motors as initial name &amp; later obtained https://t.co/46TXqRJBrz URL
1,@satanskitty6969 @GrahamAllen_1 @StephenKing He is invited!
1,@neontaster Or maybe just … bots 🤷‍♂️
1,@neontaster They’re bots in human form
1,@SamTwits ArtCenter College of Design gave me an honorary degree for my work on the original Tesla Roadster
1,@SamTwits More importantly; I was head of product and led the design of the original Roadster. Eberhard was wealthy and could have risked his money; but was unwilling to do so.
1,@stillgray For many celebrities; it’s actually their manager or “team” writing their tweets. Might be the case here.
1,@stillgray Seems like NPC to PC ratio is super high!
1,@stillgray Good question
1,@BillyM2k They won’t give up controlling the narrative easily …
1,@rawsalerts Good idea
1,@hodgetwins True
1,@PPathole @StephenKing Correct
1,@jordanbpeterson I think I see a path to Twitter exceeding a billion monthly users in 12 to 18 months

1,@Gfilche @realGeorgeHotz @WholeMarsBlog World-class software aces are joining Twitter
1,Follow World Cup on Twitter for best real-time coverage! https://t.co/9IfFSHbjl3
1,@StephenKing The goal is a trusted digital town square; where a wide range of views are tolerated; provided people don’t break the law or spam. For example; any incitement to violence will result in account suspension.
1,@CollinRugg Better
1,@StephenKing Suggestions are welcome Mr. 👑
1,@SciGuySpace Tonnage to orbit is the better metric
1,@alex_avoigt Correct. Good thread.
1,@AGHamilton29 @NateSilver538 This alleged expert is saying things that are flat-out false. I have now said several times of Twitter that incitement to violence; obviously including threats of physical harm; will result in account suspension.
1,@gunsnrosesgirl3 Will look into it
1,@Rainmaker1973 I wonder what Earth will be like 88 million years from now
1,@WholeMarsBlog Most people still have no idea. FSD is the most important software release of any kind in a very long time.

1,Simpson’s predicts I buy Twitter S26E12 https://t.co/yVmWGwrYY6
1,@teslaownersSV @stillgray It’s insane! I’m just fighting for free speech in America.
1,@ProudElephantUS @TimRunsHisMouth But Twitter as a platform must be fair to all
1,@TimRunsHisMouth But freedom of speech is the bedrock of a strong democracy and must take precedence.  My preference for the 2024 presidency is someone sensible and centrist. I had hoped that would the case for the Biden administration; but have been disappointed so far.
1,@TimRunsHisMouth As a reminder; I was a significant supporter of the Obama-Biden presidency and (reluctantly) voted for Biden over Trump
1,@mtaibbi Interesting development
1,@TimRunsHisMouth I’m fine with Trump not tweeting. The important thing is that Twitter correct a grave mistake in banning his account; despite no violation of the law or terms of service.  Deplatforming a sitting President undermined public trust in Twitter for half of America.
1,@Liz_Wheeler I certainly hope it does not come to that; but; yes; if there is no other choice; I will make an alternative phone
1,@stillgray Concerning
1,@marshallk @Esqueer_ Calling for violence will result in suspension
1,@marshallk @Esqueer_ Absolutely
1,@Esqueer_ Incitement to violence will result in account suspension.   Currently suspended accounts will be enabled slowly next week after manual review to determine whether they have potentially broken the law or engaged in spam.  Twitter will be a forum for the peaceful exchange of views.
1,@stillgray Accurate
1,@MattWallace888 @saylor @Cryptoking @RBReich If it actually becomes a problem; we will take those and other steps
1,@saylor @Cryptoking @RBReich Deliberate impersonation/deception will result in account suspension.   Organizational affiliation; bio and follower count distinguish between people who genuinely have the exact same name.  We shall see how it goes.
1,@Marco_Cim @KimDotcom The clawback may be their biggest fear
1,@dvorahfr @getpaidwrite Exactly
1,@getpaidwrite I am neither conventionally right nor left; but I agree with your point.   The woke mind virus has thoroughly penetrated entertainment and is pushing civilization towards suicide.  There needs to be a counter-narrative.
1,@realGeorgeHotz We can aspire to turn it to the betterment of all
1,What do you think of the culture war?
1,@MrAndyNgo @ramzpaul That is a disturbing story and very concerning that Twitter took no action; despite clear violation of ToS. Report in this thread for now.
1,@Cryptoking @RBReich All verified individual humans will have same blue check; as boundary of what constitutes “notable” is otherwise too subjective.  Individuals can have secondary tiny logo showing they belong to an org if verified as such by that org.  Longer explanation next week.
1,@MrAndyNgo @ramzpaul Incitement to violence will result in account suspension
1,@Cryptoking @RBReich Sorry for the delay; we’re tentatively launching Verified on Friday next week.   Gold check for companies; grey check for government; blue for individuals (celebrity or not) and all verified accounts will be manually authenticated before check activates.   Painful; but necessary.
1,@RBReich Interesting … now pay $8
1,@stillgray @axios Much Ado About Nothing
1,@AP But you have piqued my curiosity … who are these “online experts” you speak of?
1,@AP AP is such an expert in misinformation. Twitter couldn’t hope to compete!
1,@ThePrashanthCB @viniciuscfp82 Mars plans are still moving forward
1,@viniciuscfp82 How can it be both illegal and “by the court”? Twitter must abide by the laws of each country or get shut down.
1,Thanksgiving cuisine is such a delightful symphony of flavor!

1,@agazdecki Some have simply been abandoned; but vast numbers of handles were consumed by bots/trolls. Aiming to start freeing those up next month.
1,The people have spoken.  Amnesty begins next week.  Vox Populi; Vox Dei.
1,You might notice small; sometimes major; improvements in speed of Twitter. Will be especially significant in countries far away from USA.
1,Tesla Full Self-Driving Beta is now available to anyone in North America who requests it from the car screen; assuming you have bought this option.   Congrats to Tesla Autopilot/AI team on achieving a major milestone!
1,@TomFitton That’s the general idea
1,@ramzpaul Removing child exploitation is priority #1. Please reply in comments if you see anything that Twitter needs to address.
1,@joevezz Oh we have quite the adventure ahead!
1,Reducing the max allowed tweets/day to a number below what a speed typist on meth could do was helpful
1,I have half a mind to wag my finger at the 1500 accounts that caused the spike; but I shall forebear 🙄
1,@alx @nypost This is necessary to restore public trust
1,@JohnathonWillow Yeah; these are umm … bad words. I read through the list last week &amp; have to say I learned a few things 😳!!
1,@TheKameroon Great point! ♥️♥️♥️
1,@ahmedsalims Fun level on Twitter has definitely increased! I’m having a great time tbh.
1,Hate speech impressions down by 1/3 from pre-spike levels. Congrats to Twitter team! https://t.co/5BWaQoIlip
1,@montreal_girl @bradmcgash @teddyschleifer @CommunityNotes Working on it
1,@catturd2 @Rainmaker1973 They need to exist to stop scams; spam; NSFW &amp; illegal stuff from going viral; but they should obviously not be used for political purposes
1,@PatrickWStanley @BillyM2k It is objectively the case that “conservative” political candidates were more negatively affected than “progressive” candidates.  Anyone using Twitter knows this. Question is simply one of magnitude.
1,@engineers_feed Neil A; which is alien spelled backwards; was first person on the moon; and the year was 69 …
1,@stillgray Agreed; that is not ok
1,@teddyschleifer If SBF was as good at running a crypto exchange as he was at bribing media; FTX would still be solvent!
1,Have a great Thanksgiving! 🇺🇸♥️🇺🇸
1,@TrungTPhan Is this really still happening @nytimes?
1,@slashdot @dealbook This is one the biggest failures in US journalistic integrity of the 21st century
1,@ParikPatelCFA Lol; but actually true
1,@BillyM2k The more I learn; the worse it gets. The world should know the truth of what has been happening at Twitter.  Transparency will earn the trust of the people.
1,@RyanZohoury @WholeMarsBlog @semaforben Good point. Conflicts of interest should be made readily apparent to the reader.
1,@sourpatchlyds @semaforben Just wow …
1,@WholeMarsBlog @semaforben They should get a “SBF-Affiliated Media” label 🤣
1,@nichegamer @brandonorselli @semaforben That’s why he won’t answer
1,@semaforben To be direct; the very real concern here is that you have been pushing a completely false SBF ownership of Twitter narrative while effectively being his paid shill.
1,@semaforben All public holders of Twitter were allowed to roll their stock into Twitter as a private company; but he did not do so. Your reporting made it falsely sound like he did; when in fact he owns 0%.   For the last time; how much of you does SBF own? Stop dodging the question.
1,@vanschneider To be fair; there are many people at Twitter working late into the night; for whom I have great respect
1,Awesome new Twitter merch! https://t.co/zqdL9xGRuR
1,@EricRWeinstein It has been really bad. Far left San Francisco/Berkeley views have been propagated to the world via Twitter.   I’m sure this comes as no surprise to anyone watching closely.  Twitter is moving rapidly to establish an even playing field. No more thumb on the scale!
1,@jonesville @BusinessInsider It’s not a real publication
1,@DavidSacks 🤣🤣 with maybe a little editorial help from SBF’s employees @semafor
1,@DogePotamus @dogehodl2021 @StephenKing This is awesome
1,@EricNewcomer @karaswisher No grey area. Flat wrong.
1,@EricNewcomer @karaswisher On the other @semafor *did* take the SBF money and @semaforben won’t disclose how much SBF owns of them
1,@EricNewcomer @karaswisher I did not take the money. SBF/FTX do not own shares in Twitter.
1,World Cup traffic hit almost 20;000 tweets per second today! Great work by Twitter team managing record usage.
1,@StephenKing Headline: “Stephen King Tweet Causes My Pillow Sales to Skyrocket!” Lmaooo
1,@DennisCricket_ Haha sorry code release towards end of next week should allow this again
1,@David_Ingram @semaforben @semafor No. He may have owned shares in Twitter as a public company; but he certainly does not own shares in Twitter as a private company.
1,@karaswisher There was a time when you cared about the truth. That is long gone.
1,@semaforben @semafor As I said; neither I nor Twitter have taken any investment from SBF/FTX. Your article is a lie.   Now; I’m asking again; how much of you does SBF own?
1,@wintonARK It was getting to the point where the minimum impulse bit for a Silicon Valley startup was a billion dollar market cap!
1,Should Twitter offer a general amnesty to suspended accounts; provided that they have not broken the law or engaged in egregious spam?
1,@engineers_feed @Twitter So much to fix at Twitter (sigh)
1,@StatistaCharts There are lies; there are damn lies; and then there is Statista
1,@BillyM2k Some things more so than others (sigh)
1,@MrAndyNgo True
1,@ZacksJerryRig @CommunityNotes What do your jeans tell you? https://t.co/a2o6XSLm7t
1,@ZacksJerryRig According to Obama’s DoJ; the Ferguson shooting was unequivocally self-defense; so the Ferguson protests were – if you believe Obama’s DoJ – based on a false premise.  That’s not to say that other injustices don’t occur; but this does not appear to be one of them. @CommunityNotes
1,@ZacksJerryRig Full text: https://t.co/PervJOJQbq
1,@ZacksJerryRig What conspiracy theory? This what Obama’s DoJ published: https://t.co/O4DYAy63dD
1,@Rainmaker1973 @gunsnrosesgirl3 Looking into it
1,@Rainmaker1973 There was an error last week where the system incorrectly suspended &amp; deboosted your account. I’m told that those are now cleared.
1,@JohnPhillips Truth over time builds trust. Nothing else.
1,@elizableu I would like to know too
1,@semaforben @semafor What percentage of you does he own?
1,@hiromichimizuno Congratulations
1,More and more over time; as we hew closer to the truth; Twitter will earn the trust of the people
1,I hope you get that which truly makes you happy
1,@MattWallace888 @semafor Inmates are running the asylum at WaPo while Jeff parties in his hot tub
1,@realchasegeiser 🤣🤣 worth it
1,@semafor What’s going on here @semaforben?
1,@semafor Semafor is owned by SBF. This is a massive conflict of interest in your reporting. Journalistic integrity is 🗑️. https://t.co/1AB6KReJUj
1,What is best in life?
1,@stillgray Troublesome
1,@realGeorgeHotz Welcome to Twitter!
1,@BusinessInsider False. Also; Business is still not a real publication. Just give up.
1,@StephenKing What *is* the best pillow?
1,@StephenKing Is My Pillow actually a great pillow? Now I’m curious.
1,@StephenKing Oh hi lol
1,@EMTSLA @WholeMarsBlog Agreed
1,Maybe we’ve gone to heaven/hell &amp; don’t know it 🤔
1,Found in closet at Twitter HQ fr 🤣🤣 https://t.co/3xSI3KvvHk
1,@CEOAdam Twitter is where the opinion leaders are
1,@catturd2 @PatrickW @kylenabecker @Twitter I am cautiously optimistic that things will work out well
1,@kimbal @TheEconomist Nice
1,Wasn’t Twitter supposed to die by now or something … ?
1,@PatrickW @kylenabecker @Twitter A large coalition of political/social activist groups agreed not to try to kill Twitter by starving us of advertising revenue if I agreed to this condition.  They broke the deal.
1,@DineshDSouza Correct
1,@kylenabecker @Twitter Not even Associated Press with their completely fictional report on Russian missiles hitting Poland that carried severe consequences for escalating the war
1,@wizecrax @stillgray @kylenabecker @Twitter This is messed up
1,@kylenabecker @Twitter As is obvious to all but the media; there is not one permanent ban on even the most far left account spouting utter lies
1,@kylenabecker @Twitter True
1,@waitbutwhy It is shocking how many journalists viscously attack free speech; but somehow think they’re the good guys!
1,@BillyM2k the olden daze
1,@jakeshieldsajj Indeed
1,@R6BTuxYEfbGYIoB What do you mean?
1,Wait; if I Tweet does that count as work?
1,@SirineAti @Anc_Aesthetics Twitter
1,@PPathole @Anc_Aesthetics Yeah; about 6 months ago
1,@Syndicate I see a path
1,@TeslaGong @CSMFHT It’s coming
1,@teslaownersSV @CSMFHT Looking into it
1,@Anc_Aesthetics Pretty sure that was in Elden Ring
1,@unusual_whales Perhaps not unreasonable to know if anything was accomplished 🫶
1,This will improve a lot as Twitter becomes fast to use outside of North America; Western Europe &amp; Japan
1,@sama Plot twist!
1,@dogeofficialceo @MrBeast Written content too
1,@MrBeast Let’s see what happens when Twitter offers good video with higher compensation for creators …
1,The Tactics of Mistake
1,Twitter added 1.6M daily active users this past week; another all-time high https://t.co/Si3cRYnvyD
1,Holding off relaunch of Blue Verified until there is high confidence of stopping impersonation.   Will probably use different color check for organizations than individuals.
1,@egoraptor lmao
1,@PPathole Dune. Amazing to think it was written in 1965!
1,@WSJ @WSJopinion @AllysiaFinley Yeah umm … that is definitely not the reason it failed
1,Starlink now works for high latitudes
1,Tesla Megapacks are highly effective in addressing electricity demand spikes that cause power outages
1,@JamesSpiro @Israel @taylorswift13 I have! It was great.
1,@cb_doge @DanSum519 @stillgray Not many tbh
1,@Israel @taylorswift13 Your tweets are good! More countries should tweet like this. No fun being all stuffy.
1,Experience: what you get when you didn’t get what you wanted - Igor
1,@DanSum519 @stillgray Oh they’ll be back on Twitter; if they even actually left. This platform is like pharmaceutical-grade crack to them.
1,@stillgray I am having a great time 🤣🤣
1,Fanaticism is always a function of repressed doubt – Dune
1,@mysteriouskat It’s a reverse; reverse psychology trick
1,@waitbutwhy Absolutely
1,@lenjin2 @catturd2 I like his music tbh; but maybe Etsy is more his style
1,Hope all judgy hall monitors stay on other platforms – please; I’m begging u
1,@rhemrajani9 Feels so long ago 🤭
1,@lexfridman It is so entertaining!
1,Twitter is fun 🚀 💫 ♥️
1,@KimDotcom @BillFOXLA @FoxNews Behavior follows the incentives for political power
1,@lexfridman Good times :)
1,@LanceUlanoff @Rainmaker1973 Then let us work to make the future better
1,@rationalwalk @BillFOXLA @FoxNews We should actively recruit the best &amp; brightest to part of the United States!   That is what every championship sports team does.
1,@micsolana So unfair! 🤣
1,@catturd2 And it turns out that Trent “nine inch nails” Reznor is actually a crybaby 🤣
1,@Rainmaker1973 I can’t think of a worse curse than living forever
1,@BillFOXLA @FoxNews Seems bizarre that it’s so easy enter illegally; but so hard to get a legal work visa
1,@KimDotcom @SamHarrisOrg My firstborn child died in my arms. I felt his last heartbeat.   I have no mercy for anyone who would use the deaths of children for gain; politics or fame.
1,@teslaownersSV @EvaFoxU Oh man; that’s a long story; but if we haven’t cut response time in half by end of year; I will hang my head in shame
1,@BLKMDL3 @EvaFoxU Latter
1,@teslaownersSV @EvaFoxU Yes; major focus on video overall
1,@EvaFoxU Priority #1
1,@SamHarrisOrg Suffer little children; and forbid them not; to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven
1,@EvaFoxU Falcon is powered by 9 merkins!
1,Our love will never die https://t.co/y5SldfAAt0
1,And lead us not into temptation … https://t.co/8qNOXzwXS9
1,@EvaFoxU So tempting …
1,@kanyewest Don’t kill what ye hate Save what ye love
1,@teslaownersSV @kcoleman Making good progress. Still tracking to wide release next month.
1,World Cup Qatar 2022: Opening Ceremony https://t.co/TjSSitY7fK
1,@TimRunsHisMouth So you say “mainstream media” is biased?   Hmm; will have to fact-check that with mainstream media.  Nope; they say everything is cool!
1,@RaheemKassam They just can’t stop writing about Twitter; which is driving usage through roof lmao
1,@catturd2 One thing is for sure: it’s not boring https://t.co/47uPkl88gZ
1,@kcoleman Exactly
1,@stillgray @mtaibbi “All the news that’s fit to print” my ass
1,@Starbie888 @NateSilver538 [Cue Spider-Man meme]
1,@Starbie888 @NateSilver538 What could be more fun than a social network consisting entirely of hall monitors!?
1,@mtaibbi It is tragic how far The New York Times has fallen – basically just boring af far left brainwashing at this point. The boring part is truly unforgivable!
1,World Cup starts soon! Follow on Twitter for best coverage by far.
1,@TomFitton Sure as night follows day …
1,@JGreenblattADL @ADL Hey stop defaming me!
1,Twitter is ALIVE
1,@EMTSLA @teslaownersSV @RaheemKassam @nypost Good idea
1,@teslaownersSV @RaheemKassam @nypost Their posts are super boring
1,@RaheemKassam @nypost They should bring Walter Cronkite back
1,@nypost Oh forget it who cares
1,@nypost Who made this decision?
1,@KimDotcom Twitter engineering is working on it
1,@sriramk Server load is insane rn. Good stress test before World Cup tomorrow!
1,@DavidSacks Well-said
1,@LefterisJP Lmaooo
1,The people have spoken.   Trump will be reinstated.  Vox Populi; Vox Dei.
1,@TheBabylonBee 🤣 but actually
1,134M people have seen this poll
1,@TrungTPhan Red Bull does work tbh
1,@BillyM2k @lexfridman Definitely need to improve Twitter’s dopamine/cortisol ratio!
1,@BillyM2k @waitbutwhy I agree
1,The most entertaining outcome is the most likely – my variant on Occam’s Razor
1,@alexxubyte Twitter search will add feedback loops to improve result rank based on which result you click on &amp; whether you immediately click back (implies wrong result)
1,@alexxubyte Notes from last night: - Maybe deprecate TLS this week; as only needed if Android app &gt;1 year old. - Home mixer computes Home  ~10X faster than Timeline. - Ad mixer can greatly improve relevance at cost of lower total ad views. More interesting the ad; more time you look at it.
1,@ErrolWebber Most accurate would be to require access to phone GPS for location-specific polls
1,Fascinating to watch Twitter Trump poll!
1,@Nomad_1x Bot &amp; troll armies might be running out of steam soon. Some interesting lessons to clean up future polls.
1,@DavidSacks Good question
1,@WholeMarsBlog Most amount of people I’ve ever seen in the building by far
1,@Jason @DavidSacks @Zappos That was certainly my intention too!
1,Tesla FSD 10.69.3.1 going to wide release now
1,Just leaving Twitter HQ code review https://t.co/pYcXRTJm14
1,@Nomad_1x The bot attack is impressive to watch!
1,Trump poll getting ~1M votes/hour!
1,@micsolana Can’t tell if this is parody or real
1,@jack @Lucididy @jordanbpeterson Verification through the payment system plus phones; but allowing pseudonyms is the least bad solution I can think of
1,@saylor When polls are about a significant question; even those who don’t follow me tend to hear about it. That said; I agree with the idea of an all-user poll. Should also be an all-user by country poll.
1,@lexfridman Agreed
1,Reinstate former President Trump
1,@thevivafrei @paraga @jack Too bad
1,@slashdot App store fees are obviously too high due to the iOS/Android duopoly.   It is a hidden 30% tax on the Internet.
1,@Tesmanian_com Kind of him to say. I look forward to meeting.
1,First World Cup match on Sunday! Watch on Twitter for best coverage &amp; real-time commentary.
1,@BillyM2k Exactly
1,@Benioff Thanks Marc ❤️
1,Note; this applies just to the individual tweet; not the whole account
1,@TheBabylonBee If only there had been a way … 🤣🤣
1,Kathie Griffin; Jorden Peterson &amp; Babylon Bee have been reinstated.  Trump decision has not yet been made.
1,New Twitter policy is freedom of speech; but not freedom of reach.  Negative/hate tweets will be max deboosted &amp; demonetized; so no ads or other revenue to Twitter.   You won’t find the tweet unless you specifically seek it out; which is no different from rest of Internet.
1,Freedom Fridays …
1,@BillyM2k Jazz hands 🤗
1,What should Twitter do next?
1,@micsolana You don’t say …
1,@SamTwits Of course not ❤️
1,@MikeDulaimi I stand corrected!
1,@AOC You’re welcome
1,@WholeMarsBlog Record numbers of users are logging in to see if Twitter is dead; ironically making it more alive than ever!
1,@piersmorgan Seriously
1,Let that sink in …
1,And … we just hit another all-time high in Twitter usage lol
1,@stoolpresidente The best people are staying; so I’m not super worried
1,@bgurley @MichaelGuimarin Don’t wanna jinx it; but there’s a chance we can keep Twitter alive … https://t.co/mk3aCq0dEB
1,@anothercohen Thanks for helping out. You’re a lifesaver!
1,@MichaelGuimarin Thanks!
1,How do you make a small fortune in social media?  Start out with a large one.
1,@EvaFoxU The media constantly writing about Twitter is driving usage to all-time highs; so it’s fine by me!
1,@MinimalDuck @Tesla Cybertruck is something special that comes along once in a long while
1,@heydave7 Current class-action law is actually a massive tax on the American people and desperately needs reform. It is one of the reasons medication is so expensive in the USA.  Somehow; other countries do just fine without class-action law.
1,@heydave7 The actual attackers in class-action lawsuits are the law firms. They just find someone in the class to be their puppet.
1,@chazman We’re working on something that should rank replies automatically
1,Twitter is like open-sourcing the news
1,@sama Probably
1,SBF is ineffective altruism; but they thought he was saying he was in effective altruism. Easy misunderstanding.
1,@growing_daniel @jeremiahscholl I don’t wanna brag but … it’s true
1,@minliangtan Definitely
1,Not to mention the sickkk memes lol
1,Coverage of FTX meltdown is incomparably faster *and* better quality on Twitter than old-school media
1,@BillyM2k @adamscochran @accretionist Ability to do long tweets coming soon
1,@AutismCapital It’s not his fault; society is to blame. Arrest society!
1,@DavidSacks I believe in vice-signaling
1,@laurenweinstein @stocktalkweekly Correct. I will continue to run Twitter until it is in a strong place; which will take some time.
1,@jack Magic 🎱 knows all
1,@amitkgupta84 @Jason Literally working on that tonight
1,@paulg People have no idea how fast Twitter will evolve
1,@realGeorgeHotz @boing Sure; let’s talk.
1,@jimmyfallon Wait a second; how do we know you’re not an alien body snatcher pretending to be Jimmy!?   Say something that only the real Jimmy would say …
1,@rising_serpent Why is that?
1,@jimmyfallon Sounds like a job for @CommunityNotes!
1,@bowx_ To heir is human; to forgive; divine (something like that)
1,@jimmyfallon Fix what?
1,@Mrwhosetheboss Maybe
1,@NASA @NASAArtemis @NASA_SLS @NASA_Orion Congratulations!!
1,@JuliusSinghania @wongmjane X will be the everything app
1,@yukaichou I’m the taint haha
1,@nichegamer @teslaownersSV @chicago_glenn @stillgray @dcherring Yeah; next-level 🤣🤣
1,@teslaownersSV @chicago_glenn @stillgray @dcherring @nichegamer Fasting + Ozempic/Wegovy + no tasty food near me
1,@chicago_glenn @stillgray @dcherring @nichegamer Down 30 lbs!
1,@stevenmarkryan My apologies; this will be fixed within a week; two at most
1,@stillgray @dcherring @nichegamer Agreed. What will matter in the future is how many Verified followers you have.
1,@teslaownersSV We’ll widen V11 beta before Thanksgiving
1,@dcherring @nichegamer Hard to say who’s celeb &amp; who isn’t. Being able to sort by follower count &amp; disallowing deliberate impersonation probably solves this.
1,@nichegamer All unpaid legacy Blue checkmarks will be removed in a few months
1,@RationalBlonde With new release; changing your verified name will cause loss of checkmark until name is confirmed by Twitter to meet Terms of Service
1,Punting relaunch of Blue Verified to November 29th to make sure that it is rock solid
1,@business False
1,@mrjasonchoi @nytimes Interesting thread
1,@SenBillNelson @NASA @SpaceX Much appreciated; SpaceX will not let NASA down!
1,Important to admit when I’m wrong &amp; firing them was truly one of my biggest mistakes
1,Welcoming back Ligma &amp; Johnson! https://t.co/LEhXV95Njj
1,@BillyM2k Actual Silicon Valley is way crazier!
1,@waitbutwhy This is just as a result of people living longer. Population collapse is already built-in; due to dramatically decreasing birth rates.
1,@elonchieftwit False
1,@mualphaxi @micsolana @JTLonsdale @SenMarkey Much appreciated
1,@presidentbison @schrep Schrep is great
1,@libsoftiktok A tragic case of adult onset Tourette’s
1,@catturd2 @WholeMarsBlog You make a compelling case
1,@micsolana The injustice of it all 😭😭
1,@ajtourville @unusual_whales Seriously
1,@chriskatje @unusual_whales Ligma &amp; Johnson are welcome back anytime
1,@unusual_whales I would like to apologize for firing these geniuses. Their immense talent will no doubt be of great use elsewhere.
1,@MuskUniversity (cue Obama giving himself a medal meme)
1,@MuskUniversity Exactly
1,@schrep Server control team knows because they stop working from time to time. That’s why they have the “critical 40” list.
1,@schrep True. Server side can (and has been) brute-forced; but that can’t solve weak Internet connections &amp; older phones.  Worth noting that Twitter in India &amp; many other countries is slow even on latest iPhone.
1,@WholeMarsBlog Starlink is rebuilding the Internet in space; so maybe I know slightly more than some guy who wrote code for a website
1,@schrep There are ~1200 “microservices” server side; of which ~40 are critical to Twitter working at all; according to server control team.   Trimming down that 1200 number; reducing data usage; serialized trips &amp; simplifying app are all needed to improve speed of use.
1,@schrep Twitter is very slow in India; Indonesia &amp; many other countries. This is fact; not “claim”.  10 to 15 secs to refresh homeline tweets is common. Sometimes; it doesn’t work at all; especially on Android phones.  Only question is how much delay is due to bandwidth/latency/app.
1,@Umbisam Mr. Munger’s words are much appreciated
1,@minliangtan @wlopwangling Malenia battle was next-level intense
1,@minliangtan @wlopwangling Yes; although it seemed almost impossible at times
1,@waitbutwhy The ratings on this simulation are incredible
1,@wlopwangling Definitely
1,@Popeska @sampullara Why is Twitter unusably slow in many countries? Seems odd that this would be bandwidth only.
1,@micsolana Yeah; I hate it
1,By the People; For the People
1,Twitter is All the News
1,@NASASpaceflight Next test is ~20 sec firing with max oxygen fill to test autogenous pressurization; possibly one more static fire; then orbital launch attempt
1,@NASASpaceflight Test went well
1,@TrungTPhan Why the puff piece @nytimes?
1,@WholeMarsBlog Good question
1,@cb_doge Did seem a little Dr Evil tbh haha
1,@alexeheath This is an external analysis; not from Twitter. It is lower than Twitter’s published mDAU.
1,@NASASpaceflight Full test duration of 14 engines
1,Recent trend is promising https://t.co/0q7UdxSkbM
1,@nichegamer @abhiharry726 @sampullara That’s what I said!
1,@abhiharry726 @sampullara In some parts of the world; refresh takes 30 seconds
1,@Popeska @sampullara How many serial requests are made by app to refresh timeline?
1,@sampullara And we will finally stop adding what device a tweet was written on (waste of screen space &amp; compute) below every tweet. Literally no one even knows why we did that …
1,@sampullara Part of today will be turning off the “microservices” bloatware. Less than 20% are actually needed for Twitter to work!
1,@sampullara I was told ~1200 RPCs independently by several engineers at Twitter; which matches # of microservices. The ex-employee is wrong.  Same app in US takes ~2 secs to refresh (too long); but ~20 secs in India; due to bad batching/verbose comms. Actually useful data transferred is low.
1,@mishaboar @MattWallace888 That is not good
1,@SeagerKershaw @KoguanLeo @hiromichimizuno This is up to the Tesla board
1,@leandroruschel @rmotta2 Can you cite specific instances of significance?
1,@Alpsoy66 @EricFrohnhoefer @MEAInd I have Tesla covered too. Will be there part of this week.
1,@dogeofficialceo @EricFrohnhoefer @MEAInd That’s the bizarre part
1,@helvio @rmotta2 How was it proven?
1,@MattWallace888 Yay; he’s investing in Tesla!
1,@TaraBull808 @MarioNawfal @KimDotcom @RealChetBLong @favrue3 @cvpayne @AlderLaneEggs @bennyjohnson @catturd2 @RealCandaceO A question worth asking
1,@EricFrohnhoefer @MEAInd I’m ready through the list right now
1,@EricFrohnhoefer @MEAInd True; the food is great.   The fact that you don’t realize that there are up to 1200 “microservices” being called when someone uses the Twitter app is not great.
1,@FBIPantyRaid @ThisIsKyleR Interesting
1,@rmotta2 It’s on my list to review. How urgent is this?
1,@SawyerMerritt That is my philosophy
1,@jimcramer @JohnLegere Umm … no
1,@chainsawdotcom @CL207 SpaceX Starlink bought a tiny – not large – ad package to test effectiveness of Twitter advertising in Australia &amp; Spain. Did same for FB/Insta/Google.
1,@NFTDannny @SawyerMerritt End of week
1,@Fwiz @SawyerMerritt Join Twitter!
1,@CL207 Comments in this thread had me rofl
1,@SawyerMerritt Something tells me this would work 🧠
1,@__SeriousGemini @dawallach @Jason That goes without saying 🤣
1,@dawallach @Jason BTC will make it; but might be a long winter
1,@johnjhacking Concerning
1,@ShooterMcKevin1 @MrHumanityGives Accurate assessment
1,@chicago_glenn @MrHumanityGives Great movie
1,@MrHumanityGives Are FB followed real?
1,@BillyM2k Damn
1,@gchahal Good summary!
1,@AnaPaulaVolei @GFiuza_Oficial Will look into it
1,@EricFrohnhoefer Twitter is super slow on Android. What have you done to fix that?
1,@EricFrohnhoefer Then please correct me. What is the right number?
1,@_hawko False. Twitter spends $13M/year on food service for SF HQ. Badge in records show peak occupancy was 25%; average occupancy below 10%.  There are more people preparing breakfast than eating breakfast.  They don’t even bother serving dinner; because there is no one in the building.
1,@dennishegstad Increasing granularity about what “verified” actually means is the right move
1,@lexfridman I think you’re great
1,@Tattytats @AmoneyResists I can’t tell
1,@nichegamer Especially bizarre given that almost no one came to the office. Estimated cost per lunch served in past 12 months is &gt;$400.
1,@HSajwanization I hope they keep cursing me on Twitter; as it increases advertising revenue!
1,@dennishegstad We will enable organizations to manage affiliations
1,@engineers_feed Output of any company is the vector sum of people within it. Someone may be a strong vector; but negatively affect those around them to such a degree that they are a net negative.
1,Btw; I’d like to apologize for Twitter being super slow in many countries. App is doing &gt;1000 poorly batched RPCs just to render a home timeline!
1,@jessica_kirsh @SpaceX @TeslaAIBot @Tesla Cool :)
1,@johnkrausphotos Ultimately; I think there is no choice but for Twitter to be the final arbiter; but I’m open to suggestions
1,Rolling out soon; Twitter will enable organizations to identify which other Twitter accounts are actually associated with them
1,@D4VIDBRAVO Coming soon
1,@sama Amphetamines negatively affect empathy; psychedelics do the opposite
1,@People4Bernie @SenMarkey @washingtonpost Are you suggesting the Senator will abuse his political power to attack me?
1,@BillyM2k Twitter rocks
1,@muratpak @archillect What matters is that you love them
1,Twitter feels increasingly alive
1,@JohnLegere @HolyKnightKeith @Twitter @MikeSievert @TMobile I like both you and Mike! It’s just that Twitter at its core is a software &amp; servers company. The technology needs to evolve rapidly; which requires a technologist.
1,@SenMarkey @washingtonpost And why does your pp have a mask!?
1,@SenMarkey @washingtonpost Perhaps it is because your real account sounds like a parody?
1,@BLKMDL3 @DirtyTesLa @WholeMarsBlog Rollout will broaden roughly every week
1,@ID_AA_Carmack Fond memories
1,@DirtyTesLa @WholeMarsBlog Probably next month
1,@DirtyTesLa @WholeMarsBlog Going without saying that we all want ASS (Actually Smart Summon) ASAP!!
1,@slashdot No way
1,@debarghya_das @ayushkhd @Tesla Making Tesla Superchargers &amp; connectors available to all is the right thing to do
1,@A_MrBenMitchell @RadioShack @MarioNawfal Spaces should be evolve. It has potential to be truly great.
1,@pauljamil @philbak1 Probably end of next week
1,@philbak1 My reaction to SBF was … different
1,@MarioNawfal Twitter at its best!
1,@balinares This is false. Anyone who can be in office; should be. However; if not logistically possible or they have essential personal matters; then staying home is fine.  Working remotely is also ok if their manager vouches for excellence.  Same policy as Tesla &amp; SpaceX.
1,Order at https://t.co/Q1VvqV5G0i!
1,@andst7 wen doc series? @netflix
1,@CathieDWood Exactly
1,@andst7 Cool
1,@WholeMarsBlog Given all that is in V11; it will take a few weeks to expand the beta; then another few weeks to go wide release to US &amp; Canada
1,@WholeMarsBlog FSD V11 rolled out at 11:11pm Pacific
1,Twitter is
1,@KimDotcom @sama Not sure I have much to add
1,FTX meltdown/ransack being tracked in real-time on Twitter
1,@alexgilbertnz @TechEmails It’s coming
1,@TechEmails Accurate. He set off my bs detector; which is why I did not think he had $3B.
1,We’re adding a “Parody” subscript to clarify
1,@BernieSanders Full answer to insulin price question is complex. Short answer is that original insulin; discovered in 1921 (not 1923); is inexpensive; costing as little as $25.   New; higher efficacy analog variants of insulin are more expensive. @CommunityNotes  https://t.co/S4c0esI1vU
1,@WholeMarsBlog It used to be:  “Internet guy will fail at rockets/cars!”  Now it is:  “Rockets/cars guy will fail at Internet!”  Literally from same media outlets 🤣🤣
1,@SawyerMerritt @BillyM2k @WholeMarsBlog Maybe should be default off? Subscriber is a way better name.
1,Mainstream media will still thrive; but increased competition from citizens will cause them to be more accurate; as their oligopoly on information is disrupted
1,@stillgray True
1,This is from the video arcade &amp; bar area
1,@EvaFoxU Interesting
1,As Twitter pursues the goal of elevating citizen journalism; media elite will try everything to stop that from happening
1,@JeffTutorials What is Quill?
1,Twitter HQ is great (this is a real pic) https://t.co/qjfOQCr533
1,@EvaFoxU @Reuters When @CommunityNotes rolls out worldwide; it will have a powerful impact on falsehoods
1,@Reuters False
1,@BTC_Archive Needs some tweaks; but overall proceeding well
1,@WholeMarsBlog Agreed; necessary change
1,Hit all-time high of active users today
1,@TeslaTomMY1 2023 will probably be tough; but my companies are positioned well
1,Some epically funny tweets 🤣🤣
1,@stillgray @EmmanuelMacron We will take action in this regard
1,Quite the day!
1,@WholeMarsBlog I agree
1,@stillgray Absolutely
1,To be more precise; accounts doing parody impersonations. Basically; tricking people is not ok.
1,Going forward; accounts engaged in parody must include “parody” in their name; not just in bio
1,@stoolpresidente Even I paid $8; no discount
1,Usage of Twitter continues to rise. One thing is for sure: it isn’t boring!
1,@DojaCat You should be able to change your name now
1,@gainzy222 I’d watch that movie 🍿
1,@kcoleman Community Notes is a gamechanger for improving accuracy on Twitter!
1,@BiasedGirl Far too many corrupt legacy Blue “verification” checkmarks exist; so no choice but to remove legacy Blue in coming months
1,@farzyness @Twitter Indeed
1,I love when people complain about Twitter … on Twitter 🤣🤣
1,@DJSnM I’m not seeing much spam in this reply
1,@Ki_PenYakki_ay Coming
1,@mcuban It’s working for me. That said; we can definitely make the verified mentions tab more usable.
1,@chhcalling What does a tosh look like?
1,Are you seeing far fewer bots/scams/spam?
1,@Teslaconomics It’s awesome 🫐
1,@DojaCat Pretty funny though 🤣🤣
1,@DojaCat Working on it!
1,@GooseWayn That’s coming
1,@Pentosh1 You’re welcome!
1,@micsolana Rollout of new verified Blue is intentionally limited just to iOS in a few countries with very little promotion.   As we iron out issues; we will expand worldwide on all platforms.
1,@micsolana In days to come; we’ll add granularity to verified badge; such as organizational affiliation &amp; ID verification
1,@micsolana We are changing the text to say “Legacy Verified. Could be notable; but could also be bogus.”
1,@StarringShane Subscription Blue is better than legacy Blue. I switched over.
1,@PPathole The goal of Twitter DMs is to superset Signal
1,@eglyman @tryramp @Twitter Twitter is growing super fast. I hope it continues!!
1,@EvaFoxU @BillyM2k Hopefully; as soon as next week
1,@BillyM2k Totally agree!
1,@TOIPlus Nope; I was alway 🥜 !
1,@ZubyMusic Yeah
1,@lawrencekitema @SpaceNews_Inc Congratulations!
1,@SpaceNews_Inc Rockets that aren’t reusable have no future
1,@SciGuySpace Finally
1,Please note that Twitter will do lots of dumb things in coming months.   We will keep what works &amp; change what doesn’t.
1,Complaint hotline operator online! Please mention your complaints below.
1,@MKBHD Blue check will be the great leveler
1,@MKBHD I just killed it
1,@nichegamer Actual fun stuff FTW!!
1,@ID_AA_Carmack Should be noted that a significant percentage of these accounts are not real people; but some proportion are
1,@jasontoff This is super messed up. Unfortunately; many such things occurred at Twitter. Even worse was done in later years.   Meaningful growth happens when utility &amp; entertainment value improve. That will be our focus going forward.  No more fake numbers &amp; pseudo growth.
1,@micsolana When reality is indistinguishable from satire
1,@monitoringbias It is borderline illegal to support Republicans in San Francisco!   Even admitting you know some is pretty bad 🤣
1,@ZubyMusic Good point
1,@RustyRoad @ID_AA_Carmack Twitter is the most interesting place on the Internet
1,Twitter is the worst! But also the best.
1,@stevekrenzel Wow; this is messed up!
1,@WholeMarsBlog Politics is war and truth is the first casualty
1,@PPathole @mayemusk While it’s true that I’ve been under unfair &amp; misleading attack for some time by leading Democrats; my motivation here is for centrist governance; which matches the interests of most Americans
1,@BillyM2k @laoisman80 @hankgreen Exactly
1,@yoyoel Important thread
1,I just hope the servers don’t melt!
1,Twitter usage is at an all-time high lol
1,And I’m open to the idea of voting Democrat again in the future
1,To be clear; my historical party affiliation has been Independent; with an actual voting history of entirely Democrat until this year
1,@MattWallace888 @hankgreen True
1,@hankgreen Like most people in America; I agree with some of the Democrat and some of the Republican policies; but not all.  However; if executive and legislative branches are dominated by *one* party; then we lose balance of power.
1,Hardcore Democrats or Republicans never vote for the other side; so independent voters are the ones who actually decide who’s in charge!
1,To independent-minded voters:  Shared power curbs the worst excesses of both parties; therefore I recommend voting for a Republican Congress; given that the Presidency is Democratic.
1,But if Twitter is bird; that’s means … 🤯
1,Back when birds were real
1,How times have changed https://t.co/gCxUkZ4kZC
1,@TomFitton @Twitter We do
1,Twitter rules will evolve over time; but they’re currently the following: https://t.co/Ut1tXuefso
1,@greg16676935420 @jack Birds haven’t been real since 1986 https://t.co/lR6BZj0nwX
1,@mcuban $8 for all
1,@stillgray @jack Exactly
1,@jack Not everything needs to have “bird” in the name! Too many bird groups fighting each internally other at Twitter. Angry Birds.
1,@jack Birdwatch gives me the creeps
1,@SarahKSilverman Community Notes aka @birdwatch
1,@bennyjohnson @kathygriffin But if she really wants her account back; she can have it
1,@bennyjohnson @kathygriffin Actually; she was suspended for impersonating a comedian
1,@stillgray At the end of the day; if Twitter is indeed the most accurate source of information; more people will use it
1,@jack As judged by the people of Twitter via Community Notes (formerly Birdwatch)
1,@RationalEtienne @kylegrantham Absolutely
1,@kylegrantham You represent the problem: journalists who think they are the only source of legitimate information. That’s the big lie.
1,@realpfigueiredo @JosianoPadovani @reportersalles I will look into this
1,@stevenmarkryan Accurate
1,My commitment to free speech extends even to not banning the account following my plane; even though that is a direct personal safety risk
1,Twitter needs to become by far the most accurate source of information about the world. That’s our mission.
1,@alex_avoigt Twitter user numbers have increased significantly around the world since the deal was announced.  And these are very early days. As Twitter becomes by far the most reliable source of truth; it will be indispensable.
1,@BillyM2k @StonksReddit No problem to use a pseudonym. The high-level principle is just that verified users can’t engage in malicious deception.
1,@EvaFoxU @kylaschwaberow We are implementing additional safeguards to prevent impersonation; as well as collective use of Verified accounts by a single individual or organization
1,Widespread verification will democratize journalism &amp; empower the voice of the people
1,@catturd2 No exceptions
1,Any name change at all will cause temporary loss of verified checkmark
1,Previously; we issued a warning before suspension; but now that we are rolling out widespread verification; there will be no warning.   This will be clearly identified as a condition for signing up to Twitter Blue.
1,@JosianoPadovani @reportersalles What censorship are you referring to?
1,Going forward; any Twitter handles engaging in impersonation without clearly specifying “parody” will be permanently suspended
1,@SnazzyQ @CorySteuben @Erdayastronaut @live_munro We can beat that
1,@birdwatch Worth watching
1,@michaelmiraflor Fixing search is a high priority
1,@DJSnM @Erdayastronaut Noted to fix
1,Search within Twitter reminds me of Infoseek in ‘98! That will also get a lot better pronto.
1,@CorySteuben @Erdayastronaut @live_munro Interesting
1,@gchahal @TwitterBlue 42 mins to start; then several hours in a month or so
1,@BillyM2k @nikitabier We definitely need to incent people to do a lot more interactions on Twitter!
1,@Erdayastronaut We can do 42 min chunks at 1080 resolution now for new Blue; so you could break up a longer video. The 42 min limit should be fixed next month.  How does YouTube monetization work &amp; what could Twitter do better?
1,@stillgray Absolutely
1,@Cricprabhu Hopefully; less than a month
1,@AdamFostermusic Absolutely
1,@Jorge_Most_ Two weeks
1,@mahdi Something like that
1,Followed by creator monetization for all forms of content
1,Twitter will soon add ability to attach long-form text to tweets; ending absurdity of notepad screenshots
1,@aaroncohn30 @IGrabill @scottbelsky @kcoleman @AlexMahadevan Couple months
1,@RenataKonkoly @raaahulpandey @TeslaAIBot True
1,@raaahulpandey Great question. Twitter will suspend the account attempting impersonation and keep the money!   So if scammers want to do this a million times; that’s just a whole bunch of free money. https://t.co/QUrxqb59I0
1,This rocks https://t.co/sB1sL0Hdrv
1,@ProfitsTaken So long as pay $8; please be my guest
1,@IGrabill @scottbelsky @kcoleman @AlexMahadevan That is weirdly tricky due to the way Apple handles “subscriptions”. If you subscribed to the old thing; it’s not super smooth to subscribe to the new thing. We’re working on it.
1,@MarkRuffalo Hot take: not everything AOC says is 💯 accurate
1,@scottbelsky @kcoleman @AlexMahadevan This feature is an absolute gamechanger for fighting mis/disinformation at scale
1,@SirineAti @BillyM2k As soon as we confirm it’s working well in the initial set of countries and we have the translation work done; it will roll out worldwide
1,@Tesmanian_com Making great actuators for a humanoid robot is a surprisingly hard problem
1,@alex_avoigt I still do a lot of work at Tesla! Was at our Palo Alto engineering office until late Thursday night when I had to redeye to NY.
1,@BillyM2k Far too many legacy “verified” checkmarks were handed out; often arbitrarily; so in reality they are *not* verified. You can buy as many as you want right now with a Google search.  Piggybacking off payment system plus Apple/Android is a much better way to ensure verification.
1,@Techgnostik @alex_avoigt Correct
1,@kcoleman @AlexMahadevan Birdwatch (soon to be renamed Community Notes) has incredible potential for improving information accuracy on Twitter!
1,Trash me all day; but it’ll cost $8
1,⚡️⚡️⚡️ Power to the People ⚡️⚡️⚡️
1,@CryptoDaddyTV I try my best
1,@mrddmia Thank you.   A thermonuclear name &amp; shame is exactly what will happen if this continues.
1,Regarding Twitter’s reduction in force; unfortunately there is no choice when the company is losing over $4M/day.  Everyone exited was offered 3 months of severance; which is 50% more than legally required.
1,@TomFitton @Twitter @yoyoel @JudicialWatch Twitter will not censor accurate information about anything
1,Again; to be crystal clear; Twitter’s strong commitment to content moderation remains absolutely unchanged.  In fact; we have actually seen hateful speech at times this week decline *below* our prior norms; contrary to what you may read in the press.
1,Excellent summary of Twitter’s Trust &amp; Safety from the head of the team
1,@hankgreen Hank; try a Google search …
1,@ZssBecker Agreed. Working on it.
1,@hankgreen And therefore Twitter should die?
1,@stillgray You’re right
1,Twitter has had a massive drop in revenue; due to activist groups pressuring advertisers; even though nothing has changed with content moderation and we did everything we could to appease the activists.  Extremely messed up! They’re trying to destroy free speech in America.
1,@WalterIsaacson Absolutely
1,@TomFitton That assessment is more accurate than most people realize
1,@waitbutwhy Unsure if confirming or denying that  I’m an alien is more convincing that  I’m an alien
1,@Plinz maybe we’re already in it
1,@waitbutwhy I’m an alien trying to get back to my home planet
1,@varmentmobile @POTUS There are in fact 2 agendas
1,Tiny talk is talk so small it feels like it’s coming from your own mind
1,@bennyjohnson @AOC What can I say? It was a naked abuse of power.
1,Why is small talk even legal!?
1,A neuron doesn’t realize it’s a neuron
1,@CookieCrumb35 Pretty much; or at least one of the hive minds
1,… with a lot of room for improvement
1,Because it consists of billions of bidirectional interactions per day; Twitter can be thought of as a collective; cybernetic super-intelligence
1,@AliZafarsays @MrBeast True; Twitter has amazing content in Japan – roughly half of all adults online – but it’s almost never seen outside of Japan
1,@AOC Your feedback is appreciated; now pay $8
1,Advertisers should support:
1,Twitter is simply the most interesting place on the Internet. That’s why you’re reading this tweet right now.
1,@RealSpikeCohen The system is working 🤣
1,Being attacked by both right &amp; left simultaneously is a good sign
1,@TrungTPhan Quite a few companies like this
1,@BillyM2k Works every time
1,@cafreiman @micsolana Capital allocation should be done by those best at doing so
1,@TesLatino @Tesla Still a fair bit of polish to be done on 69.3. It’s a major release posing as a minor release.
1,@adrianhon Some good ideas here
1,you get what you pay for
1,@Rubiu5 If verified accounts violate terms of service; eg spam/scam/impersonation; they’ll be suspended; but Twitter will keep their money!  We will definitely add cool stuff like what you’re suggesting to Twitter Blue.
1,@MichaelDell Thanks Michael
1,@bennyjohnson Absolutely agreed that the Twitter safety board should have people from all viewpoints
1,@HSajwanization Exactly!
1,@micsolana The community notes feature is awesome.   Our goal is to make Twitter the most accurate source of information on Earth; without regard to political affiliation.
1,@yoyoel @JGreenblattADL @YaelEisenstat @rashadrobinson @JGo4Justice @normanlschen @DerrickNAACP @TheBushCenter @SindyBenavides Twitter's content moderation council will include representatives with widely divergent views; which will certainly include the civil rights community and groups who face hate-fueled violence
1,@yoyoel @JGreenblattADL @YaelEisenstat @rashadrobinson @JGo4Justice @normanlschen @DerrickNAACP @TheBushCenter @SindyBenavides Twitter will not allow anyone who was de-platformed for violating Twitter rules back on platform until we have a clear process for doing so; which will take at least a few more weeks
1,@yoyoel Talked to civil society leaders @JGreenblattADL; @YaelEisenstat; @rashadrobinson; @JGo4Justice; @normanlschen; @DerrickNAACP; @TheBushCenter Ken Hersch &amp; @SindyBenavides about how Twitter will continue to combat hate &amp; harassment &amp; enforce its election integrity policies
1,@foundmyfitness I think so
1,@klwtts Exactly!
1,Twitter speaks to the inner masochist in all of us
1,@TomFitton @Twitter @yoyoel It’s the user’s own setting that did this
1,Totally stole idea of charging for insults &amp; arguments from Monty Python tbh https://t.co/oFKRyp3BS7
1,To all complainers; please continue complaining; but it will cost $8
1,@Rubiu5 That already happens very frequently
1,@Erdayastronaut @SpaceForceDoD @SLDelta45 @SpaceX Falcon Heavy is a testament to the awesomeness of humanity
1,@Jihoz_Axie Sounds like a good idea
1,There will be a secondary tag below the name for someone who is a public figure; which is already the case for politicians
1,@saylor Yes; this will destroy the bots. If a paid Blue account engages in spam/scam; that account will be suspended.   Essentially; this raises the cost of crime on Twitter by several orders of magnitude.
1,@Gfilche Absolutely essential. Creators need to make a living!
1,This will also give Twitter a revenue stream to reward content creators
1,@Emmonspired @MKBHD Exactly
1,And paywall bypass for publishers willing to work with us
1,You will also get: - Priority in replies; mentions &amp; search; which is essential to defeat spam/scam - Ability to post long video &amp; audio - Half as many ads
1,Price adjusted by country proportionate to purchasing power parity
1,Twitter’s current lords &amp; peasants system for who has or doesn’t have a blue checkmark is bullshit.   Power to the people! Blue for $8/month.
1,Sonic BOOMS!!
1,Falcon Heavy launch in ~30 mins
1,@StephenKing I will explain the rationale in longer form before this is implemented. It is the only way to defeat the bots &amp; trolls.
1,@StephenKing We need to pay the bills somehow! Twitter cannot rely entirely on advertisers. How about $8?
1,Halloween with my Mom https://t.co/xOAgNeeiNN
1,@BillyM2k @Jason I confess; it’s all my fault
1,@yoyoel I recommend following @yoyoel for the most accurate understanding of what’s happening with trust &amp; safety at Twitter
1,@DaneCook I hate sarcasm so much you can’t believe it
1,@MKBHD For now
1,@erichjrusch @Twitter @Jason @DavidSacks Definitely
1,@JennaEllisEsq @RealMarkFinchem Looking into it
1,@EvaFoxU This is just temporary
1,@RNRakowitz @wfamarketers @SEP @GerryDAngelo @philsmithisba @Diageo_News @bjankow @kieley_taylor @barone9323 @ajb_sf @meghaley6 Twitter’s commitment to brand safety is unchanged
1,If I had a dollar for every time someone asked me if Trump is coming back on this platform; Twitter would be minting money!
1,@paulg The Guardian used to have balance (moderately left) and integrity; but now it is a far left wing propaganda machine. I hope they get back to where they were one day.
1,@BillyM2k Oh no; all our diabolical plans have been revealed!!
1,@MrBeast What could we do to make it better than TikTok?
1,@Jason Interesting
1,@Politics_Polls He sucks!!!
1,Bring back Vine?
1,@Liz_Wheeler We’ve all made some questionable tweets; me more than most; but I want to be clear that I support Yoel. My sense is that he has high integrity; and we are all entitled to our political beliefs.

1,@fasc1nate What an incredible creature!
1,@johnkrausphotos @sriramk The whole verification process is being revamped right now
1,@ericuman This is false
1,@itsALLrisky @spideycyp_155 @WholeMarsBlog Tweeps will be twits going forward; as the latter has vastly more gravitas
1,@TonyadeVitti @spideycyp_155 @WholeMarsBlog Pretty much

1,But Management 201 is such a tantalizing carrot …
1,@WholeMarsBlog My title is Chief Twit right there in the bio. No idea who the CEO is.
1,So demanding to allow a mere 30 days to learn this priceless information!
1,Just received this email from Twitter. This is an actual; real email that was autogenerated 🤣🤣 https://t.co/7DQp4sNINX
1,@TomFitton @Twitter @JustTheNews I will look into this. Twitter should be even-handed; favoring neither side.
1,@danzwku @ID_AA_Carmack Absolutely
1,@ID_AA_Carmack d(he)ll
1,@WholeMarsBlog @karpathy Andrej will always be welcome at Tesla
1,Finally; the truth that carbs are amazing can be said on this platform!  #FreeSpeech
1,Fresh baked bread &amp; pastries are some of the great joys of life
1,@amasad Good point.   Being able to select which version of Twitter you want is probably better; much as it would be for a movie maturity rating.   The rating of the tweet itself could be self-selected; then modified by user feedback.
1,@WholeMarsBlog One of the best trolls ever 🤣🤣
1,@cosminDZS Something like this makes sense
1,@greg16676935420 Ace reporting by @cnbc 🤣🤣
1,To be super clear; we have not yet made any changes to Twitter’s content moderation policies
1,@Rainmaker1973 Sorry about that. Fixing as fast as possible!
1,Ligma Johnson had it coming 🍆 💦 https://t.co/CgjrOV5eM2
1,@MikhailaFuller @jordanbpeterson Anyone suspended for minor &amp; dubious reasons will be freed from Twitter jail
1,Comedy is now legal on Twitter
1,@RpsAgainstTrump Ye’s account was restored by Twitter before the acquisition. They did not consult with or inform me.
1,Twitter will be forming a content moderation council with widely diverse viewpoints.   No major content decisions or account reinstatements will happen before that council convenes.

1,@ARodTV Definitely closer to citizen journalism – local news orgs are under-appreciated &amp; should get way more prominence on Twitter
1,@sandyleevincent Nobody bats 1000 🤷‍♂️
1,A beautiful thing about Twitter is how it empowers citizen journalism – people are able to disseminate news without an establishment bias
1,@teslaownersSV I’m a big fan of citizen journalism!
1,“According to unnamed sources close to the matter who wish to remain anonymous” 🤣🤣

1,@elon_wisdom Too much respect for authority inhibits innovation

1,@SwipeWright Twitter should be as broadly inclusive as possible; serving as a fair forum for lively; even if occasionally rancorous; debate between widely divergent beliefs.
1,@MuskUniversity Absolutely necessary
1,@MuskUniversity Important
1,@DavidSacks Exactly!
1,@VinnyLingham Yeah; doesn’t make sense
1,@MuskUniversity Good thread

1,@MarcusHouse @LordofEa @kerrikgray @chicago_glenn @Tesla @teslaownersSV @dvorahfr @TonyadeVitti @SpaceX @SirineAti That’s the plan; unless it is damaged in testing. What really matters is that ship &amp; booster production line is spooling up. Also; each new ship &amp; booster has incremental design improvements.
1,@ChananBos @SquawkCNBC @Kasparov63 Yeah; I’m back to spare bedroom /couch surfing at friend’s houses in Silicon Valley; which I did for about a decade.  Frankly; I like it this way; as I get to see my friends; who I love; more often.
1,@spideycyp_155 @SquawkCNBC @Kasparov63 I did as a child; but found it to be too simple to be useful in real life: a mere 8 by 8 grid; no fog of war; no technology tree; no random map or spawn position; only 2 players; both sides exact same pieces; etc.  Polytopia addresses these limitations.
1,@SquawkCNBC @Kasparov63 And I don’t even own a house; let alone a “mansion”; you douche

1,@SKMorefield Interesting
1,@pcgamer Great game
1,Maybe it was a social media algorithm; not even people

1,Who decides “The Current Thing?” Real question. I don’t know.
1,@andst7 Exactly. WaPo are such hypocrites.

1,@ruthbenghiat Why are you perpetuating propaganda concocted by the oil &amp; gas industry to distract you from the 6 trillion dollars per *year* of subsidies those companies receive? https://t.co/XZxDJAPE9a
1,@stillgray @DavidSacks Switzerland &amp; Belgium have great chocolate; but I do also love eccentric British &amp; Irish artisanal sweet shops
1,@DavidSacks Good thread
1,@teslaownersSV Next week. It’s actually a major release; so a lot more internal testing is needed before going to public beta.
1,@ksadjadpour Cool
1,@DavidSacks 🤣🤣   Although there could be more R&amp;D in candy tbh. Feels like there hasn’t been much improvement in decades.
1,@WholeMarsBlog Headline is misleading. Starlink can obviously offer far more robust positioning than GPS; as it will have ~1000X more satellites over time.   Not all will have line of sight to users; but still &gt;10X GPS &amp; far stronger signal.  Just not today’s problem.
1,@eigenrobot One of my favorite conspiracy theories is that the world is actually 80% men
1,@ChessProblem un ass ailable logic!
1,@LifeboatHQ You’re right. Eventually; we all run out of time. https://t.co/GyXk9uZLIW
1,Only Giga Berlin can make these colors; as paint shop was specially built to apply many fine layers of paint; giving it complexity not otherwise possible
1,@teslaownersSV @BillyM2k Varies a lot. Tesla &amp; SpaceX are in good positions; but many other companies are not.   Recessions do have a silver lining in that companies that shouldn’t exist stop existing.
1,@RenataKonkoly @ThorstenBasch @spideycyp_155 @BillyM2k Those who want Putin removed are laboring under the misapprehension that whoever replaces him will be more amenable to peace or western philosophy; but I think this is unlikely – the Kremlin is not the Nice Guy Olympics
1,@ThorstenBasch @spideycyp_155 @BillyM2k Russia overrunning Ukraine would destabilize the entire region; perhaps the world
1,@spideycyp_155 @BillyM2k If Russia faced calamitous defeat in conventional warfare for something as strategically critical as Crimea; the probability of using nuclear weapons is high
1,@jamesplloyd @SpaceX I do. Yes.
1,@spideycyp_155 @BillyM2k Still very unlikely; but this is the closest we’ve been since Cuba in ‘62
1,@teslaownersSV @BillyM2k Just guessing; but probably until spring of ‘24
1,@BillyM2k It sure would be nice to have one year without a horrible global event
1,@AndrewPerpetua “Brutal for both sides” will be a common phrase in the months to come

1,@MedvedevRussiaE @trussliz Pretty good troll tbh
1,@Alan_McGuinness *humour
1,@ilyasut I couldn’t agree more 😜
1,@Alan_McGuinness British humor is the best
1,@PPathole @EvaFoxU @DavidSacks Compromise is overwhelmingly the most likely outcome – just a question of how much death &amp; destruction happens before then
1,@gaborgurbacs @EvaFoxU @DavidSacks That should be the nature of the debate
1,@EvaFoxU @DavidSacks Most probable outcome by far is a horrible war of attrition that destroys Ukraine &amp; severely damages Russia; with massive body count on both sides.  And; in the end; the same outcome.   So why?
1,@DavidSacks Exactly
1,Congrats to @SpaceX team on 48th launch this year! Falcon 9 now holds record for most launches of a single vehicle type in a year.
1,@Neuro_Skeptic Same
1,@marenkahnert @jasondebolt Exactly
1,@Teslarati @13ericralph31 SpaceX has more active satellites in orbit than rest of Earth combined; tracking to double rest of Earth soon
1,@jasondebolt The media reports with great fanfare my predictions that are late; but rarely those that come early
1,@Teslarati @JohnnaCrider1 Accelerating sustainable energy is our primary mission
1,@westcoastbill Will require truly exceptional execution; but it is possible
1,I will not let you down; no matter what it takes
1,@DirtyTesLa Awesome
1,We even did a Starlink video call on one airplane aloft to Starlink on another; far away; airplane aloft and it worked perfectly with no lag!
1,@chazman @aelluswamy Several major architectural upgrades in 10.69.3; so it’s much more than a point release; but we’re sticking with 10.69 just cause haha

1,And … sold out!
1,Internet in airplanes will feel same as if you were accessing Internet at home!
1,28;700 bottles of exquisite Burnt Hair perfume already sold!   Only 1;300 left of this unique; limited edition; collector’s item.
1,@cb_doge @alex_avoigt We’re working on it. Hope to release something next week.
1,@alex_avoigt No money from DoD; but several other countries; orgs &amp; individuals are paying for ~11k/25k terminals (thanks!).  SpaceX is losing ~$20M/month due to unpaid service &amp; costs related to enhanced security measures for cyberwar defense; but we’ll keep doing it (sigh).
1,@atrupar Smart? Maybe.  Does dumb stuff? Definitely!
1,@balajis True

1,@stoolpresidente I have a plan
1,@TeslaAIBot @SpaceX @Tesla Thanks Optimus :)
1,@SawyerMerritt @SpaceX To be precise; 25;300 terminals were sent to Ukraine; but; at present; only 10;630 are paying for service
1,@SawyerMerritt @SpaceX SpaceX has already withdrawn its request for funding
1,@starrski71 @RenataKonkoly @EvaFoxU @kadubai11 @spideycyp_155 Wrong analogy. America also had a humiliating withdrawal from Afghanistan. No one in America sees that country as part of America.  Crimea *is* seen as a crucial part of Russia by Russia; much as Hawaii is seen as a crucial part of America.
1,@PPathole @spideycyp_155 Probably not
1,@zerohedge Practice makes perfect …
1,@RenataKonkoly @EvaFoxU @kadubai11 @spideycyp_155 Russia has been punched in the nose and forced to retreat many times by Ukraine.   But what you don’t want to do is give Russia a choice of total; humiliating defeat or nukes – then the probability of them using nukes is high.
1,@kadubai11 @spideycyp_155 Obviously many disagree with this logic; but what do they think is their probability of being wrong about WW3.   If they say 0%; they are utterly dangerous fools.
1,@kadubai11 @spideycyp_155 But; hey; look on the bright side! At least Russia doesn’t get Crimea in that scenario; so you can be comforted by that thought; while watching the mushroom clouds rise.
1,@kadubai11 @spideycyp_155 If Russia faces destruction of their army and utter defeat by NATO; they will use nukes; then NATO will respond with nukes and civilization is over
1,@spideycyp_155 Whether one likes it or not; Crimea is absolutely seen as a core part of Russia by Russia.   Crimea is also of critical national security importance to Russia; as it is their southern navy base.  From their standpoint losing Crimea is like USA losing Hawaii &amp; Pearl Harbor.
1,@hyiki22 @spideycyp_155 Exactly
1,@spideycyp_155 If Russia is faced with the choice of losing Crimea or using battlefield nukes; they will choose the latter.  We’ve already sanctioned/cutoff Russia in every possible way; so what more do they have left to lose?   If we nuke Russia back; they will nuke us and then we have WW3.
1,Exceptionally well-said
1,@rhensing @keith_dorschner @teslaownersSV Standard (non-performance) 3 &amp; Y suspension in production now has improved comfort; without affecting handling
1,@DrKnowItAll16 @pirate3Guy @HSerunjogi Yeah; RV version is lower priority than standard version.   You should still see high speeds during off hours. Is that happening?  As we add more satellites &amp; upgrade satellite technology; speeds in high user density locations should see significant increases.
1,Ok; we will add a donate option to Starlink
1,@pirate3Guy @HSerunjogi That’s oddly low. Normally; much higher.
1,Are there others that want to donate Starlinks to places in need?
1,@DogecoinNorway @moxie @ID_AA_Carmack 🤣 that’s happened to me many times
1,@moxie @ID_AA_Carmack A much quieter leaf blower is possible
1,@teslaownersSV This is harder than it sounds; but ok

1,@KimDotcom @Twitter Damned if you do; damned if you don’t; so … guess I’m just damned
1,@SawyerMerritt Starship &amp; next-gen Starlink satellites are key; but much risk lies ahead before those are working at scale
1,@RaheemKassam The hilarious thing is you’re not wrong 🤣
1,@EvaFoxU So it goes …
1,@gainzy222 Fate loves irony
1,@DavidSacks Even so; we should still do good deeds
1,The hell with it … even though Starlink is still losing money &amp; other companies are getting billions of taxpayer $; we’ll just keep funding Ukraine govt for free
1,@Brian_J_Berger That dude is not just a “condition of anonymity” spineless coward; he’s also an ignorant fool. Starlink was directly requested by the Ukraine government; as it was the only thing that worked.
1,@spideycyp_155 @PPathole @ashleevance It has required a lot of our resources. Going into super lockdown mode slows down new development progress; as we have to resist attacks from a sophisticated adversary actively at war.
1,@ashleevance DoD provided about 3% of the Falcon 1 development cost. Appreciated; certainly; but should be seen in context.
1,@PPathole @ashleevance Of course. And their signal jamming systems are also getting better.
1,@ashleevance The amount SpaceX is requesting for a major battlefield advantage is less than the cost of one new GPS satellite. Ironically; GPS doesn’t work on battlefields; as the signal is easy to jam; but Starlink does.
1,@ajtourville Would be great if someday humanity stopped pointing nukes at itself that would destroy almost all life on Earth.  In any given year; there is a chance above zero that they will be launched. We are now at the highest risk in 60 years.  https://t.co/hSqNeYHNX1
1,@WholeMarsBlog Curses; foiled again!
1,@mtaibbi Accurate
1,@ajtourville Russia has the ability to destroy USA &amp; Europe utterly with nuclear missiles in less than 30 minutes &amp; vice versa.  A surprising number of people don’t know this.  Of course; it would be MAD to use them; but it is also MAD to be in this situation at all.
1,@nichegamer This has potential
1,@rschmied @spideycyp_155 @SawyerMerritt @SpaceX Internet fiber; phone lines; cell towers &amp; other space-based comms in war areas have been destroyed.   Starlink is all that’s left. For now.  https://t.co/CdjbOWgziz
1,@FedorovMykhailo Thank you for clarifying this 💙🇺🇦💛
1,@StonksReddit @rschmied @spideycyp_155 @SawyerMerritt @SpaceX Starlink is the primary communications system of the Ukrainian army on the war front. If anyone else wants this job; please be my guest …
1,@rschmied @spideycyp_155 @SawyerMerritt @SpaceX Big difference between peace comms vs warfront comms.   Starlink is only comms system still working at warfront – others all dead.   Russia is actively trying to kill Starlink. To safeguard; SpaceX has diverted massive resources towards defense.  Even so; Starlink may still die.
1,@EvaFoxU @Nobody_Really7 @EvaKBartlett Concerning
1,@stillgray Are there citizens of nations who are helping Ukraine on this list?
1,@ajtourville But surely no reasonable person would launch nuclear war?  The problem with that logic is if we were dealing with reasonable people; we wouldn’t have war in the first place.
1,@EvaKBartlett Is this list real? What’s the URL?
1,@Rainmaker1973 People should never fear turbulence. Commercial airliner wings can handle insane amounts of bending.
1,@mtaibbi The right question to ask
1,@officejjsmart @MelnykAndrij We’re just following his recommendation 🤷‍♂️
1,@narutium @SawyerMerritt Falcon can probably get Starlink past breakeven; but Starship is needed to fund Mars
1,@spideycyp_155 @SawyerMerritt @SpaceX In addition to terminals; we have to create; launch; maintain &amp; replenish satellites &amp; ground stations &amp; pay telcos for access to Internet via gateways.   We’ve also had to defend against cyberattacks &amp; jamming; which are getting harder.  Burn is approaching ~$20M/month.
1,@SawyerMerritt Also; Starlink is still losing money! It is insanely difficult for a LEO communications constellation to avoid bankruptcy – that was the fate of every company that tried this before.  When asked what the goal of Starlink was at a space conference; I said “not go bankrupt”.
1,@BogusThought @SawyerMerritt @rfdctr Maybe the 🐈 got their 👅
1,@spideycyp_155 @SawyerMerritt @rfdctr @SpaceX Very few in Iran so far
1,@SawyerMerritt Strange that nothing was leaked about our competitors in space launch &amp; communications; Lockheed &amp; Boeing; who get over $60B …  Wouldn’t be surprised to find this particular individual working there when he retires from DoD. Corruption at its finest.
1,@SawyerMerritt @rfdctr SpaceX is not asking to recoup past expenses; but also cannot fund the existing system indefinitely *and* send several thousand more terminals that have data usage up to 100X greater than typical households. This is unreasonable.
1,@MuskUniversity Vital to the future of consciousness
1,@BogusThought srsly
1,@teslaownersSV @JohnnaCrider1 Next week
1,@JohnnaCrider1 Envy has driven him to madness
1,@leehumerian Starlink requires nothing except ~50 Watt power source. With a small solar system plus battery or a generator; you will have connectivity anywhere.
1,@OwenSparks_ @spideycyp_155 @FedorovMykhailo @SpaceX True
1,@spideycyp_155 @FedorovMykhailo @SpaceX There are some active terminals
1,@spideycyp_155 @FedorovMykhailo @SpaceX Of course; this happens almost every day. They successfully destroyed Viasat in Ukraine several months ago. https://t.co/xrrAMqfsZY

1,@PPathole @NorthmanTrader Pointless; as there is currently no overlap between Russian and Ukrainian demands – it’s not even close
1,@NorthmanTrader No; it is not. I have spoken to Putin only once and that was about 18 months ago. The subject matter was space.
1,@kanyewest Talked to ye today &amp; expressed my concerns about his recent tweet; which I think he took to heart
1,@Teslarati @JohnnaCrider1 It was built &amp; paid for at my request. Hunter &amp; team did great work.
1,@WholeMarsBlog It will
1,@chicago_glenn @neiltyson Strange @Twitter
1,@WholeMarsBlog I have no desire to become involved in wars; but it is safe to say that all bets are off if the nukes start flying
1,@Teslarati Strong candidate to win most counter-intuitive product of the year!
1,@MuskUniversity Important to bear in mind when reading anything
1,@neiltyson Indeed; that kinetic energy scales with the square of velocity is not well-appreciated!  A sealed escape pod with a heat shield would probably work.
1,@lexfridman So many blind spots
1,@spideycyp_155 @EvaFoxU There are ~25k terminals in Ukraine; but each terminal can be used to provide an Internet uplink to a cell phone tower; so potentially several thousand people can be served by a single terminal

1,@spideycyp_155 @SawyerMerritt @ChristopherJM @FT @MehulAtLarge @felschwartz I am in regular contact with Fedorov
1,@ChristopherJM @FT @MehulAtLarge @felschwartz Bad reporting by FT. This article falsely claims that Starlink terminals &amp; service were paid for; when only a small percentage have been.   This operation has cost SpaceX $80M &amp; will exceed $100M by end of year.  As for what’s happening on the battlefield; that’s classified.
1,@skorusARK Starlink will provide the vast majority of bandwidth from space

1,@EliClifton @DavidSacks Accurate assessment
1,@garyblack00 Correct
1,@stevenmarkryan So they’re saying that not buying Twitter is bad; but also buying Twitter is bad!?
1,@LucidTrading_ @DavidSacks We talked via videoconference last year
1,War is the ultimate Supreme Court
1,@bdquinn @LindseyGrahamSC Kherson and Zaporizhzhia almost certainly do not want to join Russia – annexation of those regions was done to ensure a land bridge and water supply to Crimea
1,@LindseyGrahamSC Obviously; not everyone who voted for the pro-Russia party wanted to join Russia; but it would also be inaccurate to say that none did.
1,@LindseyGrahamSC Below is the electoral map of 2012. Blue is the pro-Russia party. https://t.co/YkZ9hipyAV
1,@LindseyGrahamSC Assuming you believe that the will of the people matters; we should; in any given conflict region; support the will of those who live there.   Most of Ukraine unequivocally wants to be part of Ukraine; but some eastern portions have Russian majorities and prefer Russia.
1,@LindseyGrahamSC First of all; Tesla hasn’t had that consumer tax credit for years &amp; we didn’t ask for this one – GM &amp; Ford did
1,Another batch of Starlinks in orbit; 7 hours after the astronaut launch
1,@ashleevance That wouldn’t be hard to do
1,@TEDchris Twitter is an accelerant to fulfilling the original https://t.co/bOUOek5Cvy vision
1,@KonstantinKisin I do not think it is simple at all; but I have yet to hear any realistic path to peace.  Ukraine has achieved many brilliant tactical victories; but should be wary of overconfidence leading to strategic defeat.  When Russia fully mobilizes; millions on both sides will die.
1,@WholeMarsBlog 10.69.3 will actually be a major upgrade. We’re keeping .69 just because haha.
1,@LarckeningXuruo Twitter probably accelerates X by 3 to 5 years; but I could be wrong
1,Buying Twitter is an accelerant to creating X; the everything app
1,@SawyerMerritt Should be noted that Starlink is still far from cash flow positive. All LEO communications constellations to date have gone bankrupt; so any support is super helpful.
1,@FrenchyRagin @Kasparov63 A small number of terminals were paid for by the govt; vast majority were not. This is just another bs WaPo hit piece.
1,@ZelenskyyUa I still very much support Ukraine; but am convinced that massive escalation of the war will cause great harm to Ukraine and possibly the world.
1,@Kasparov63 We gave Starlinks to Ukraine &amp; lost $80M+ in doing so; while putting SpaceX &amp; myself at serious risk of Russian cyberattack.  What have you done besides tweet?
1,@DavidSacks SpaceX’s out of pocket cost to enable &amp; support Starlink in Ukraine is ~$80M so far. Our support for Russia is $0. Obviously; we are pro Ukraine.  Trying to retake Crimea will cause massive death; probably fail &amp; risk nuclear war. This would be terrible for Ukraine &amp; Earth.
1,@slashdot In other news; remote controlled anal beads sold out everywhere
1,@spideycyp_155 @StonksReddit @Podolyak_M That referendum was questionable; which is why I suggested repeating it under UN (or other trusted entity) supervision
1,@StonksReddit @Podolyak_M Great; offer a UN supervised vote and if Russia refuses; then war it is
1,@Podolyak_M Maybe a similar approach to Kosovo https://t.co/cGPpaXAaA3
1,@Podolyak_M No; I’m suggesting voting under UN (or pick your most trusted entity or country) supervision
1,@RenataKonkoly Russia is doing partial mobilization. They go to full war mobilization if Crimea is at risk. Death on both sides will be devastating.  Russia has &gt;3 times population of Ukraine; so victory for Ukraine is unlikely in total war. If you care about the people of Ukraine; seek peace.
1,@RenataKonkoly You are assuming that I wish to be popular. I don’t care.  I do care that millions of people may die needlessly for an essentially identical outcome.
1,Let’s try this then: the will of the people who live in the Donbas &amp; Crimea should decide whether they’re part of Russia or Ukraine
1,@PopMech Cheese is amazing
1,@Nemli_mot Indeed. Biggest bot attack I’ve ever seen.
1,@raulsanchezuk The bot attack on this poll is strong!
1,@AkiKivirinta The will of the people should decide whether they are part of Russia or Ukraine; but Russia invaded areas that would unequivocally choose to be part of Ukraine
1,Also worth noting that a possible; albeit unlikely; outcome from this conflict is nuclear war
1,This is highly likely to be the outcome in the end – just a question of how many die before then
1,Ukraine-Russia Peace:  - Redo elections of annexed regions under UN supervision. Russia leaves if that is will of the people.  - Crimea formally part of Russia; as it has been since 1783 (until Khrushchev’s mistake).  - Water supply to Crimea assured.  - Ukraine remains neutral.
1,@jasondebolt That is my assessment too
1,@tim_zaman Well-said! Also; we try to operate the team as non-hierarchically as possible &amp; allow movement between project areas; so you don’t get pigeon-holed.

1,@RickyDoggin Interesting
1,This was made using @Grok.   The standard @DOGE is asking for in a response is literally this low.  EXTREMELY troubling that some parts of government think this is TOO MUCH!!  What is wrong with them??

1,As many people have said; why pay terrorist organizations and certain countries to hate us when they’re perfectly willing to do it for free?
1,@teslaownersSV Yeah
1,Why it is vital to solve the deficit
1,Should all federal employees be required to send a short email with some basic bullet points about what they accomplished last week?
1,@Noahpinion If that is true; why am I so dumb?
1,And download the dedicated @Grok app
1,Tesla self-driving feels like magic
1,@Noahpinion It is trivial to game IQ tests and get an extremely high score once you learn to mentally model the test makers.   We are all extremely dumb compared to the advent digital superintelligence that is happening in real-time.
1,@Noahpinion @devahaz Fuck you; I’m not a liar. You are.
1,Beautiful
1,Cool
1,@rpoo Yeah
1,True
1,This email is a very basic pulse check
1,The reason this matters is that a significant number of people who are supposed to be working for the government are doing so little work that they are not checking their email at all!  In some cases; we believe non-existent people or the identities of dead people are being used
1,This is a trivial task
1,@seanonolennon Yeah
1,A large number of good responses have been received already. These are the people who should be considered for promotion.
1,Try @Grok voice mode and personalities
1,An incredible week!
1,@VigilantSailor Yes; strange indeed
1,Indeed; this takes less than 5 mins
1,Exactly
1,@bayeslord But have you tried Grok? 😂
1,@WholeMarsBlog Yeah
1,To be clear; the bar is very low here.   An email with some bullet points that make any sense at all is acceptable!  Should take less than 5 mins to write.
1,@SenTinaSmith What did you get done last week?
1,Grok voice early beta is now available on the @Grok app.   This is early beta; so expect issues (that will be resolved fast); but it’s still awesome.
1,That would be a very impressive and long list indeed for you!  However; the passing grade is literally just “Can you send an email with words that make any sense at all?”.   It’s a low bar.

1,This is a great approach

1,Absolutely
1,True

1,Excessive laws and regulations result in almost everything being illegal; enabling the government to engage in selective enforcement.   They can then take any company down for POLITICAL reasons; aka lawfare.

1,@SciGuySpace @Space_Station The decision is up to the President; but my recommendation is as soon as possible.  I recommend 2 years from now.
1,@mitchellvii A significant percentage of the money “sent to Ukraine” actually ended up benefitting US politicians; the DNC and some Republicans.   That’s why Zelensky says he only received half the money.
1,It is time to begin preparations for deorbiting the @Space_Station.   It has served its purpose. There is very little incremental utility.   Let’s go to Mars.
1,@KenKirtland17 You are the liar.   And the people you cite were not party to the discussions.   Liar.
1,@DrPhiltill And this so-called “Commander” doesn’t know his ass from a hole in the ground.  Dude has no clue what’s really going on.   He’s a passenger.
1,@DrPhiltill Price was never even discussed! They flatly refused. We would have made it work within the annual budget.   The real issue is that they did not want positive press for someone who supported Trump.   That’s it. End of story.
1,@valkyriesrwomen @MarioNawfal For sure
1,@libsoftiktok Seems Shiffty
1,@KonstantinKisin You’re losing credibility with this.   Either Zelensky holds an election to prove that he represents the will of the people or he is a dictator.
1,@AdamLowisz @DefiyantlyFree There must be some solution that is not constant daily death of Ukrainian men in trenches
1,Wow; the public outrage is high 🤣🤣
1,Unfortunately; @CommunityNotes is increasingly being gamed by governments &amp; legacy media.   Working to fix this …  It should be utterly obvious that a Zelensky-controlled poll about his OWN approval is not credible!!  If Zelensky was actually loved by the people of Ukraine; he

1,Exactly
1,@redsteeze What are the issues with the Red Cross?  Most people don’t know.
1,@Astro_Andreas You are fully retarded.   SpaceX could have brought them back several months ago.   I OFFERED THIS DIRECTLY to the Biden administration and they refused.   Return WAS pushed back for political reasons.   Idiot.
1,Fraudsters complain the loudest when you take away their fraud
1,True
1,@Acyn This Community Note is false.   SpaceX could have brought the astronauts back last year; but Biden pushed the return past the inauguration date.   Legacy media is NOT a reliable source.
1,The most out-of-the-box thinking is realizing you’re trapped in a box created by others.   Only then can you escape the box to another box.   Repeat.
1,Legacy media are mostly just puppets; with massive influence by the state.   The amount of money that @DOGE is discovering going from government to fake “independent” media is shocking.
1,You can improve the graphics just by asking Grok to do so btw.   We’re starting work on integrating dynamically-created high-resolution graphics; so that you can make photo-realistic games that evolve differently for every player.   Join the @xAI team!
1,Try Grok voice mode and change the personality to whatever you want.   It’s awesome 😎

1,@AutismCapital The President confirmed tonight that he supports this idea!
1,Cool
1,@catturd2 I never mentioned a specific dollar figure.   Just said that I would see if the President wanted to consider a tax reduction linked to DOGE savings. He may or he may not.  The amount would therefore obviously be proportionate to how much savings DOGE actually achieves. More

1,This is a deliberate strategy by Democrats to use government handouts to attract and retain illegal immigrants; as illegals vote overwhelmingly Democrat.   In New York and many other parts of the country; illegals are alreadt allowed to vote in local elections.   As they become
1,@GuntherEagleman This is how you can tell the swamp is being drained
1,@MikeBenzCyber @FmrRepMattGaetz Heartless beasts that we are; @DOGE is indeed going to take away healthcare from dead people 😂

1,@lexfridman Did you try voice mode?
1,All you need to know to understand which company will win a technology competition is look at the first and second derivatives of the rate of innovation
1,@Rothmus Such a crazy high monetary incentive per homeless person means the homeless problem will be maximized; not minimized
1,@DavidSHolz So true 😂
1,Grok 3 presentation starting shortly
1,@amitisinvesting Given the strong tendency of AI companies to become the opposite of their name; calling it Safe Super Intelligence is tempting fate!
1,@charliekirk11 Indeed
1,@JohnLeFevre Great!
1,@MostlyPeacefull People actually pay money to go to this? 🤣
1,@WholeMarsBlog Voice mode is still a little patchy; so probably launches in about a week; but it’s awesome
1,Exactly
1,Progress!
1,AP stands for Associated Propaganda!
1,@jeffreyatucker Yup; totally insane
1,@MarioNawfal @DOGE There is no DOGE Facebook page.   Associated Propaganda is lying.
1,@TeslaBoomerMama @Poshmarkapp Congrats!
1,@jonfavs Please identify which safety personnel were fired and we will bring them back immediately.   To the best of our knowledge; no one affecting safety has been fired.
1,Romania deserves its own sovereignty!  🇷🇴
1,@Inevitablewest Doing our best to fight for the people!
1,@WallStreetApes They are protesting against the actual democratic will of the people. They are on the moral low ground!
1,@nicksortor Spraying paint into someone’s face is not ok!
1,Major improvement in Treasury payment integrity going live!  This was a combined effort of @DOGE; @USTreasury and @FederalReserve. Nice work by all.
1,@Geiger_Capital It would be cool for the public to see what so much gold looks like. It is theirs; after all!  Hopefully; the storage facility has above zero style.
1,My rough estimate is that it’s ~80% lack of competence/caring and ~20% fraud.   But that’s still a lot of fraud!
1,This is what competent leadership looks like
1,@libsoftiktok This would be super cool
1,@SenFettermanPA I love the people. We just want to fix the waste and fraud that is bankrupting the country.   The scrutiny on me is extreme; so it’s not like I could “get away” with something; nor do I have any incentive to do so.
1,This gold is the property of the American people. I sure hope it’s still there!
1,@LevineJonathan Jackpot 🎰 🤩
1,@themarketswork @Shem_Infinite @NormEisen @MSNBC @CapehartJ Good question
1,@libsoftiktok President @realDonaldTrump won a majority of the country; so they’re the ones advocating tyranny
1,Looking for the gold at Fort Knox … https://t.co/YVGQvBfwVt
1,This is happening nationally via fraud https://t.co/qcVJGtlEWR
1,@NikMesaris Exactly
1,@DefiantLs Absolutely
1,@PeteHegseth @IRSnews They love the low blows
1,The REAL reason so many Democrats are upset about entitlements (social security; medical; etc) fraud investigations is that they are using your taxpayer money as handouts to attract and retain ILLEGAL immigrants. Their future voters.   That’s what it’s all about.  Truth.
1,Bruh; if I wanted to rummage through random personal shit; I could have done that at PAYPAL. Hello???  Having tens of millions of people marked in Social Security as “ALIVE” when they are definitely dead is a HUGE problem.   Obviously.  Some of these people would have been alive https://t.co/6hBqAJ5TbF
1,@BullMooseMemes I think this is the last chance for Germany
1,@glennbeck @BasedMikeLee Yeah!
1,Who is confirming that gold wasn’t stolen from Fort Knox?   Maybe it’s there; maybe it’s not.   That gold is owned by the American public! We want to know if it’s still there.
1,@LauraLoomer @womensmarch @realDonaldTrump They are going way too far. A man was actually murdered by Luigi and they tried to kill the President twice.   This is not ok at all.
1,@LauraLoomer @LoomerUnleashed Advocating murder of the President is a serious crime and they have the gall to do so on President’s Day!  Letting @EagleEdMartin know about this.
1,What @DOGE is doing is similar to Clinton/Gore Dem policies of the 1990s.  The current Dem party has just gone so crazy far left that it isn’t recognizable anymore!
1,Yeah; that’s so mean of them!
1,@RealAlexJones Crazy!

1,@CavemanDiary What’s super weird is that the @USGAO pointed out years ago that millions of dead people were tagged as alive by Social Security; but nothing was done!
1,@VasBroughtToX @WallStreetApes That’s the real question 🙋‍♂️

1,@OpenAINewsroom From a friend: “Bret Taylor is a scammer running an agents startup that literally has no product whatsoever and is funneling money into OpenAI. He just does bureaucracy.” 🤣🤣
1,@MarioNawfal The SPLC is yet another scam.   No more mooching off the taxpayer for them.
1,The logic flow diagram for the Social Security system looks INSANE. No one person actually knows how it works.   The payment files that move between Social Security and Treasury have significant inconsistencies that are not reconciled. It’s wild.
1,They grow up so fast 🥰
1,I am endlessly amused by the infinite indignities I suffer on the very platform that I own

1,@BigImpactHumans 💯😂  It’s not like he has a job!
1,Reasoning from first principles is a superpower

1,@teslaownersSV @PPathole @breezefps The Bay Area is already saturated with user terminals; which is why wait time for a terminal is long.   Rush hour speeds will improve as more satellites reach operational orbits; with a giant improvement with V2 sats.   Note; speeds outside of rush hour times should be very high.
1,@PPathole @breezefps Best outcome would be to route packets from Starlink user terminal to ground station on roof of server center.   Then it doesn’t even touch the regular Internet.
1,@JayinShanghai @Tesla Probability of injury; according to US government  https://t.co/EwLFlC7LZT
1,@EvaFoxU Exactly
1,@breezefps Starlink inter-satellite laser links should be operational by end of year. This will dramatically reduce global latency.   Light travels ~40% faster in vacuum/air than in fiber optic cables &amp; satellite path length is shorter (cables follow coastlines).

1,Also; FSD Beta 10.12.2 now expanding to 100k cars.   10.13 smooths out intersection control; especially long lefts; and starts to handle roads with no map data at all.   Last point is a big deal. Within a few months; FSD should be able to drive to a GPS point with zero map data.

1,@PPathole Open primaries sound like a good way to move candidates to be more centrist.  Term limits help with the gerontocracy problem; but; frankly; there should be a max age beyond which you can’t run (maybe 70?); just like there are min ages for house; senate &amp; president.
1,@VW @Tesla Thanks; and also well done to you for advancing electric vehicles!
1,@ExplainThisBob Once again; Bob nails it.  Yes; I am endorsing a political candidate because he is competent!
1,It is rare for me to endorse political candidates.   My political leanings are moderate; so neither fully Republican nor Democrat; which I am confident is the case for most Americans.  Executive competence is super underrated in politics – we should care about that a lot more!
1,Los Angeles is fortunate to have someone like Rick Caruso running for mayor. He’s awesome.

1,@abledoc @scottfarkas @Tesla @JoeJustice Everyone eats same food; uses same restrooms; etc – no executive chef or other ivory tower stuff.   There shouldn’t be this workers vs management two-class system. Everyone is a worker.
1,@jamesdouma @RadarMoron @JeffTutorials @karpathy Transformers are replacing C heuristics for post-processing of the vision NN’s “giant bag of points”.  [Side note: I hate the bloated mess that is modern C++; but love simple C; as you know what it will compile to in terms of actual CPU operations.]
1,@scottfarkas The above set of tweets illustrate why recessions serve a vital economic cleansing function
1,@spideycyp_155 @eringriffith I never wanted to be CEO – just wanted to work on product/technology. Bill Harris sounded like he would be a great CEO; given his Intuit experience; but he was not.  Running companies hurts my heart; but I don’t see any other way to bring technology &amp; design to fruition.
1,@OrbitHigher @JeffTutorials Yeah
1,@eringriffith Similar thing happened to X/PayPal in March 2000
1,@JeffTutorials We’re using more GPTs; as they now run natively on Tesla TRIP chip vs needing to round trip to iGPU

1,We are trying to accelerate sustainable energy; so what matters is how much someone can contribute to that goal.   Personal choices are your own and are respected.

1,@spideycyp_155 @AndrewYang I will donate to centrist candidates in both parties
1,@AndrewYang Is this a reference to open primaries? I think those are a good idea.   I am in favor of anything that would result in more centrist candidates being elected!
1,@PPathole @Rainmaker1973 The amazing part will be having an orbital rocket that is fully &amp; rapidly reusable with any payload at all!  Everyone else gave up when they realized that their fully reusable payload&lt;0.  We still have a long way to go.
1,@Rainmaker1973 The specs on Wikipedia aren’t quite right; but close enough.  Thrust; liftoff mass; length &amp; payload will grow over time.
1,@DBurkland @WholeMarsBlog Yes; unless we encounter unexpected issues. 10.12.2 seems solid so far; but; as always; please be extremely vigilant.

1,@ummjackson Completely useless pos more like it
1,@PinballReed @crikey_news @ummjackson @cameronwilson And Palmer always forgets to mention that he never wrote a single line of Dogecoin code …
1,@DimaZeniuk @PinballReed @crikey_news @ummjackson @cameronwilson For AI and most things; Python. JavaScript for web stuff.   For high performance or tight code; C/C++; spiced up with some assembly.
1,@DogecoinNorway @Louisbotelho17 @teslaownersSV @PPathole @Gfilche @MadeInTheUSANJ @JoeBiden Yeah!
1,@Andst7 @PPathole @HamblinZeke @DrKnowItAll16 @stevenmarkryan @paraga Maybe if they do the opposite; Twitter will be a much better experience – just an idea
1,@PPathole @HamblinZeke @DrKnowItAll16 @stevenmarkryan @paraga Checking
1,@PinballReed @crikey_news @ummjackson @cameronwilson My kids wrote better code when they were 12 than the nonsense script Jackson sent me.   Like I said; if it’s so great; he should share it with the world and make everyone’s experience with Twitter better. If he does; you will see what I mean.  Jackson Palmer is a tool.
1,@crikey_news @ummjackson @cameronwilson You falsely claimed ur lame snippet of Python gets rid of bots. Ok buddy; then share it with the world …
1,@HamblinZeke @DrKnowItAll16 @stevenmarkryan What’s going on @paraga?
1,@stevenmarkryan Very strange indeed!
1,@Louisbotelho17 @teslaownersSV @PPathole @Gfilche @MadeInTheUSANJ @JoeBiden Interesting
1,@WholeMarsBlog Yeah; maybe a smidge higher …
1,@agoyal00 @WholeMarsBlog @PPathole @Gfilche @MadeInTheUSANJ Yes. It’s safe to say that Mackenzie [ahem] Scott is not exactly a big fan of her ex-husband.   Unfortunately; a lot of others are getting caught in the crossfire.
1,@teslaownersSV @PPathole @Gfilche @MadeInTheUSANJ @JoeBiden Feels like a Looney Tunes episode
1,@ExplainThisBob I support you; Bob! Some bots are good.
1,@S3XYstarship @PPathole @Gfilche @MadeInTheUSANJ Yeah; although I hesitate to admit that; because there are a lot of people that foam at the mouth if you even mention his name!
1,@teslaownersSV @PPathole @Gfilche @MadeInTheUSANJ The Democrat vs Republican tribalism among otherwise intelligent people is most distressing.  Demonizing everyone who would vote for an alternate party is not constructive.
1,@PPathole @Gfilche @MadeInTheUSANJ True. Tesla was attacked by Romney in 2 of 3 presidential debates. Those lines were fed to him by a particular individual in the oil &amp; gas industry.  The Dems turned negative over the past ~12 months. At least part of it is Mackenzie’s donation to PACs posing as charities.
1,@KimDotcom I would be shocked if I’m *not* being spied on haha.   My only ask is that anyone spying on me please not affect call quality too much or I can’t hear what’s being said!
1,@Gfilche @MadeInTheUSANJ I’m just talking about the mid-term elections in November. Not sure that there is a third party candidate.  It’s rather hard to support a party when prominent members of that party keep attacking me and sidelining Tesla &amp; SpaceX!

1,@James76931 @HardDriveMag Mildly; so 6/10. It’s a slow meme day.
1,@Shruggernauts @HardDriveMag @kevinpodas I would; but the coward blocked me 🤣 https://t.co/CiZXNxgpaP
1,I miss them https://t.co/nTZkFM1D3k
1,@HardDriveMag The reason you’re not that funny is because you’re woke.   Humor relies on an intuitive &amp; often awkward truth being recognized by the audience; but wokism is a lie; which is why nobody laughs.
1,@HardDriveMag Less funny than SNL on a bad day. This could make a drunk person sober. Try harder!
1,@PPathole @jack Still early stages on that. Getting Starship reliably to orbit; then achieving full &amp; immediate reusability of both stages is by far top priority.
1,@jack 2029 feels like a pivotal year. I’d be surprised if we don’t have AGI by then. Hopefully; people on Mars too.
1,@HardDriveMag Well; if you make something that looks like a meme &amp; someone (not me) crops off your name; so it goes.  Also; this is only a 6/10 meme; so maybe step down from that high horse!  The selfless art of anonymous meme creators is something to be admired.
1,@truth_tesla @MadeInTheUSANJ Yeah; the public has no idea how much Tesla and SpaceX have been attacked/undermined; because we aren’t unionized (yet offer highest pay in industry!) and this administration would rather a company be dead than not unionized
1,@karpathy I couldn’t agree more! There is such a thing as too much sentience for household appliances.  Imagine giving advanced AI to a toilet with an implicit “maximize 💩” utility function; so it engages in deep societal manipulation just to get maximum 💩 haha.
1,@MadeInTheUSANJ I support free speech; but not any one candidate. In fact; I gave money to &amp; voted for Hillary &amp; then voted for Biden.  However; given unprovoked attacks by leading Democrats against me &amp; a very cold shoulder to Tesla &amp; SpaceX; I intend to vote Republican in November.

1,@conor64 The “critics” seek not to critique; but rather to virtue signal. They are out of touch with the people and so lose their credibility with the people.
1,@ICannot_Enough @JohnnaCrider1 Weird
1,@jonastsla @jamesdouma @heydave7 @karpathy @WholeMarsBlog Our video clips are usually shorter than 30 seconds; but the overall point made by James is accurate.   Tesla is probably labeling more images per week than any other project ever done and our rate of labeling is increasing rapidly.
1,@JohnnaCrider1 I suspect that this is because the “algorithm” is not exactly genius vs intentional deboosting by people

1,@S3XYstarship @ACTBrigitte He’s fine; I guess. Does seem like he’s spending a lot of time in the hot tub these days.  If he wants to get to orbit; less partying and more work would be advisable.
1,@EvaFoxU Long-term potential of Tesla is high
1,@GigaS3XY @ACTBrigitte It was $500M; but then Tesla went up a lot; so now it’s $1.5B to $2B to close it out
1,@PPathole @LouDobbs My companies don’t buy advertising
1,@ACTBrigitte Since Gates still has a multi-billion dollar short position against Tesla while claiming to help with global warming; I guess I have some trust issues with him too
1,@EvaFoxU True; they must have a scapegoat
1,@LouDobbs I do try my hardest to be good and sometimes I fear that untrue negative stories about me may cause others to excuse their bad behavior to their conscience; because they think I’m doing it too; but I’m not!
1,@LouDobbs I know some of the people you mention and I think they’re good; but for sure not all billionaires are good; since we are dealing with humans after all.

1,@westcoastbill For sure
1,@uniteCOforus @thebradfordfile Yeah; I think that’s probably right. If it were up to me; I would delete charitable deduction. And class-action lawsuits.
1,@wanda_hudson @TomFitton @AJDelgado13 I think this would actually work
1,@TheTeslaBull @BLKMDL3 @S3XYstarship @IWill_Travel @AOC Based on past experience; about 12 to 18 months. Companies that are inherently negative cash flow (ie value destroyers) need to die; so that they stop consuming resources.
1,@andymilonakis Fair
1,@SmileSimplify @AOC I’m genuinely curious
1,@BLKMDL3 @S3XYstarship @IWill_Travel @AOC Yes; but this is actually a good thing. It has been raining money on fools for too long. Some bankruptcies need to happen.  Also; all the Covid stay-at-home stuff has tricked people into thinking that you don’t actually need to work hard. Rude awakening inbound!
1,@StrategistSpace @IWill_Travel @AOC That would be awesome
1,@S3XYstarship @IWill_Travel @AOC This would be a super bad idea; since stocks can swing wildly from one day to the next; eg Snapchat dropping 43%. Tesla is ~40% below ATH!  However; eliminating estate tax dodges like GRATs would be good; since probability of kids being effective stewards of capital is lower.
1,@IWill_Travel @AOC The degree to which the unions control the Dems is insane. It’s like watching a sock puppet “talk”; but the hand inside the sock is way too obvious!

1,Almost ten years ago
1,@JohnnaCrider1 @TomFitton @AJDelgado13 There is a sergeant making judgment calls about recruits before giving them a weapon; so that’s a reasonable barrier
1,@TomFitton @AJDelgado13 How about a middle ground; where the licensing standard for semi-auto rifles is a driver’s license; age 21 and no rap sheet?   Basically; what is a reasonable way to make it harder for people with homicidal impulses to obtain body count maximizing weapons?

1,@JaneidyEve @stevenmarkryan If I were to own Twitter; it would be geared towards the middle 80% of the population; so technically the far left and far right would probably be dissatisfied
1,@RustyRoad @teslaownersSV @RyanGirdusky @GoodPoliticGuy Human are absurdly concentrated on a tiny percentage of Earth’s surface. That’s why people in cities think Earth is “full” of people; when in fact it is basically empty.

1,@mtaibbi Exactly
1,@WholeMarsBlog Indeed I did.   However; I also think that Tesla has the potential to be the most valuable company ever.   When Tesla’s market cap; making sustainable energy products; exceeds that of Aramco; producing fossil fuels; you know the future will be good for Earth.
1,@teslaownersSV The Iron Man statue was given to SpaceX because part of Iron Man 2 was filmed in the rocket factory

1,@teslaownersSV @micarrdc Should be proportionate to electricity prices. Is this not the case?
1,@micarrdc It’s accurate to say that incentives were an accelerant to EV adoption; but we started Tesla when there were no incentives &amp; gasoline was $2/gallon even in California.  Tesla currently has a tax credit *disadvantage*; because the $7500 tax credit stopped applying to us years ago.

1,Finally; we get to use Elongate as scandal name. It’s kinda perfect. 🤣
1,@teslaownersSV @JohnnaCrider1 @TaraBull808 No; it was clear that their only goal was a hit price to interfere with the Twitter acquisition. The story was written before they even talked to me.
1,@JohnnaCrider1 @TaraBull808 Exactly. Moreover; the “friend” in question who gave the interview to BI; is a far left activist/actress in LA with a major political axe to grind.
1,@TaraBull808 But I have a challenge to this liar who claims their friend saw me “exposed” – describe just one thing; anything at all (scars; tattoos; …) that isn’t known by the public. She won’t be able to do so; because it never happened.
1,@TaraBull808 And; for the record; those wild accusations are utterly untrue
1,The attacks against me should be viewed through a political lens – this is their standard (despicable) playbook – but nothing will deter me from fighting for a good future and your right to free speech
1,@TaraBull808 Exactly
1,@EvaFoxU I’m trying! Nice meme.
1,To be clear; I’m spending &lt;5% (but actually) of my time on the Twitter acquisition. It ain’t rocket science!  Yesterday was Giga Texas; today is Starbase. Tesla is on my mind 24/7.  So may seem like below; but not true. https://t.co/CXfWiLD2f8
1,@WholeMarsBlog Big update
1,@historydefined I think I saw that boss in Elden Ring
1,@Astro_Angry Unless it is stopped; the woke mind virus will destroy civilization and humanity will never reached Mars
1,Wise words
1,Good night; sweet maestro; and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest https://t.co/sqiY8iHS41
1,@nichegamer A true genius
1,@ArtLightstone It’s true haha
1,@El__Bohemio Indeed
1,@GailAlfarATX I suggest no parties and just direct voting by the people of concise laws that everyone can understand
1,@harsimranbansal For sure
1,@WholeMarsBlog This is a big one! Expect some two steps forward; one step back situations. These will be great ironed in point releases; hence ~10.12.2 or 10.13 for wider beta release.
1,A party more moderate on all issues than either Reps or Dems would be ideal
1,@redletterdave I was (obv) joking at the time; but fate loves irony!
1,Judging by the relentless hatestream from the far left; this tweet was spot on
1,@paulg @thehowie Yale gets🥇in wacktivist olympics
1,What I love most about wacktivists is their incredible sense of humor 👼
1,A clear case of wacktivism
1,Another batch of Starlinks reach orbit
1,In the past I voted Democrat; because they were (mostly) the kindness party.  But they have become the party of division &amp; hate; so I can no longer support them and will vote Republican.  Now; watch their dirty tricks campaign against me unfold … 🍿
1,@BillyM2k Pretty much. The dirty tricks attacks will be next-level.
1,@thehowie I’m not surprised at all. That was to inoculate the public. As a prominent vaccine advocate; you should understand that.  Yale is the epicenter of the woke mind virus attempting to destroy civilization.
1,Despite Tesla doing more for the environment than any company ever! https://t.co/ImxrhnRepj
1,Political attacks on me will escalate dramatically in coming months
1,.@SPGlobalRatings has lost their integrity
1,@PPathole Exactly
1,Exxon is rated top ten best in world for environment; social &amp; governance (ESG) by S&amp;P 500; while Tesla didn’t make the list!  ESG is a scam. It has been weaponized by phony social justice warriors.
1,@EricBalchunas ESG is an outrageous scam!   Shame on @SPGlobal
1,Even applied 2 urslf
1,@garyblack00 Or 14 times higher than Twitter’s 5% in my case 🤨
1,@garyblack00 So … [checks calculator] … that would be like 10 times more than 5%
1,@garyblack00 Interesting
1,@MmeAlexandraS @MoodysInvSvc @SPGlobalRatings @ICannot_Enough @RonMadison11 @garyblack00 Tesla doesn’t need debt; so the rating doesn’t impact us; but it is silly
1,@bennyjohnson Twitter exec trashing free speech &amp; mocking people with Asperger’s …
1,@intelligent_eat Yes; the purpose of AI Day is to convince great AI/software/chip talent to join Tesla
1,Tesla AI Day #2 on Aug 19. So many cool updates!
1,@bennyjohnson Is this legit?
1,@EvaFoxU Hello @SECGov; anyone home?
1,@cb_doge The audience laughter says it all
1,@johnrich Absolutely
1,@PPathole @Teslarati Exactly
1,@occupymars42069 @paraga Interesting
1,@Andst7 @paraga Seems like Twitter should welcome external validation if their claims are true
1,@Teslarati 20% fake/spam accounts; while 4 times what Twitter claims; could be *much* higher.  My offer was based on Twitter’s SEC filings being accurate.  Yesterday; Twitter’s CEO publicly refused to show proof of &lt;5%.  This deal cannot move forward until he does.
1,@paul_griffiths This transcription isn’t precise; but gets the gist of it
1,@jarokrolewski Just a scratch really
1,@paraga So how do advertisers know what they’re getting for their money? This is fundamental to the financial health of Twitter.
1,@paraga Have you tried just calling them?
1,@BillyM2k Billy is the best
1,@alanagoodman I wonder who funds them
1,@SPKolten @heyitsyashu I don’t have much choice. Provided they don’t explicitly say that I endorse something; there is no legal recourse.
1,@jokowi It was an honor to meet at Starbase and discuss exciting future projects!
1,@heyitsyashu I hope it’s a good product!
1,@historydefined Tragically; it wasn’t even oil from a snake!
1,@TomFitton @netflix @Twitter @WSJ Good move by @netflix
1,@teslaownersSV No; I interact with interesting comments that I see too; even if made by people I don’t follow
1,@BillyM2k I’m a bot &amp; so’s my wife
1,@ZacksJerryRig Wow; you must be Sherlock f* Holmes.  I’m joking.
1,Not to mention potential bugs in the code. Open source is the way to go to solve both trust and efficacy.
1,I’m not suggesting malice in the algorithm; but rather that it’s trying to guess what you might want to read and; in doing so; inadvertently manipulate/amplify your viewpoints without you realizing this is happening
1,@StrivenB @BLKMDL3 @PPathole That’s a deep cut (sigh)
1,@MODL3PILOT @coffeetabletsla @PPathole @Twitter Yes; that would have a big impact!
1,@coffeetabletsla @PPathole @Twitter With usernames like that; the bots aren’t even trying hard!
1,@BLKMDL3 @PPathole There is some chance it might be over 90% of daily active users; which is the metric that matters to advertisers.  Very odd that the most popular tweets of all time were only liked by ~2% of daily active users.
1,@PPathole Exactly. I have yet to see *any* analysis that has fake/spam/duplicates at &lt;5%.
1,@mtaibbi Shame on @WSJ for shoddy reporting!

1,@nichegamer Just another day in Elden Ring!
1,@PPathole @Twitter Twitter legal just called to complain that I violated their NDA by revealing the bot check sample size is 100!  This actually happened.
1,(This message brought to you by the Illuminaughty)
1,Very important to fix your Twitter feed:  1. Tap home button. 2. Tap stars on upper right of screen. 3. Select “Latest tweets”.  You are being manipulated by the algorithm in ways you don’t realize.  Easy to switch back &amp; forth to see the difference.
1,@DBurkland Team is working the weekend to get 10.12 in limited release tomorrow. Then we evaluate; do a point update; and broaden the release. 10.12.2 is probably where we can expand to a safety score of 95+.
1,At least; that’s what the lib hivemind thinks haha
1,Whoever thought owning the libs would be cheap never tried to acquire a social media company!
1,The bots are angry at being counted 🤣
1,@PPathole @Twitter Any sensible random sampling process is fine. If many people independently get similar results for % of fake/spam/duplicate accounts; that will be telling.  I picked 100 as the sample size number; because that is what Twitter uses to calculate &lt;5% fake/spam/duplicate.
1,@fintwit_news @Twitter I relied upon the accuracy of Twitter’s public filings
1,@stevenmarkryan @teslaownersSV @Twitter Interesting
1,@teslaownersSV @Twitter If we collectively try to figure out the bot/duplicate user percentage; we can probably crowdsource a good answer
1,@teslaownersSV @Twitter Ignore first 1000 followers; then pick every 10th. I’m open to better ideas.
1,@coffeetabletsla @Twitter Pick any account with a lot of followers
1,To find out; my team will do a random sample of 100 followers of @twitter.   I invite others to repeat the same process and see what they discover …
1,@BillyM2k The axiomatic error was that housing prices only go up. I don’t support predatory lending; but many of those lenders were severely wounded or didn’t survive.   They dug their own graves – a lesson we should all take to heart; including me.
1,Still committed to acquisition
1,Twitter deal temporarily on hold pending details supporting calculation that spam/fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of users https://t.co/Y2t0QMuuyn
1,The straw war is emblematic of larger social issues
1,@Gfilche @Tesla It still needs more work imo; but we can probably widen the beta a little next month
1,@pmarca This is messed up
1,@JeffTutorials Seriously?
1,How did it even start?
1,@teslaownersSV And tastes like cardboard!
1,The last straw was the last straw!
1,Stop the war on straws! https://t.co/aHv7uvm17D
1,@ScottAdamsSays @DawgGabriel But I do think that twitter should authenticate all real users and prioritize those replies above unauthenticated users
1,@ScottAdamsSays @DawgGabriel The drinking bleach hoax was a hoax https://t.co/bORNLRfzSX
1,Updated Starlink availability by region
1,@BillyM2k If Twitter can tell the difference between real and fake users; why does it allow these in our comments? https://t.co/0EuhTfaVfF
1,@lexfridman Exactly
1,@PPathole @BillyM2k Didn’t occur to founders of USA that people would live so long; so they put in age minimums (for wisdom); but not age maximums (for … 😴)
1,@BillyM2k And also younger than 8000 years old!
1,Biden’s mistake is that he thinks he was elected to transform the country; but actually everyone just wanted less drama
1,Even though I think a less divisive candidate would be better in 2024; I still think Trump should be restored to Twitter
1,Don’t Diss Information
1,@mazemoore Disconcerting …
1,@BillyM2k It has potential as a currency
1,@slashdot Overzealous DMCA is a plague on humanity
1,@slashdot Current copyright law in general goes absurdly far beyond protecting the original creator
1,@waitbutwhy The whole notion of being “left wing” or “right wing” is silly.   Almost no one initially agrees with the semi-random collection of policies associated with each wing.  They only support those policies *after* they join the left or right mind tribe.
1,@waitbutwhy Great thread
1,@jack Yeah
1,Tap on the stars in upper right of screen to revert to chronological
1,Chronological tweets seem much better than what “the algorithm” suggests
1,@stevenmarkryan Literally true. Even 100x is possible.
1,@WholeMarsBlog Without billions of miles of training data; solving self-driving is impossible
1,@BillyM2k Exactly
1,Starlink has resisted Russian cyberwar jamming &amp; hacking attempts so far; but they’re ramping up their efforts https://t.co/w62yCsDA5w
1,@bennyjohnson Important to listen to my full explanation

1,@Tesmanian_com The Tesla China team is amazing
1,@ThierryBreton Great meeting! We are very much on the same page.
1,@RationalEtienne @HindenburgRes You might be right
1,@kangaro0_ @historydefined Int/Dex build; so mostly mage with some weapon skills. Shield in left hand; staff in right with rapier &amp; claws fast switch.

1,@HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN Video games are scarier than any horror movie by far
1,@HindenburgRes Interesting. Don’t forget to look on the bright side of life sometimes!
1,Chocolate milk is insanely good. Just had some.
1,@Muskstaycalm I’d like to meet this guy (if he is real). Hard to tell with deepfakes these days.
1,@Cernovich Like I said; my preference is to hew close to the laws of countries in which Twitter operates. If the citizens want something banned; then pass a law to do so; otherwise it should be allowed.
1,@Cernovich Twitter obv has a strong left wing bias
1,There are no angels in war
1,@historydefined Not be a buzzkill on this issue; but Venice itself is slowly dying due to very low birth rates

1,@hiromichimizuno @SawyerMerritt Correct
1,@SawyerMerritt Yes! Stop the outrageous false ESG assessments; where Tesla gets a bad grade; but an oil company can get a good grade. Total gaming of the system!
1,@WholeMarsBlog At risk of stating the obvious; unless something changes to cause the birth rate to exceed the death rate; Japan will eventually cease to exist. This would be a great loss for the world.
1,@lexfridman How to find secret doors in Elden Ring
1,Also; work ethic expectations would be extreme; but much less than I demand of myself
1,@DavidSacks Sage advice in this thread …
1,@waitbutwhy It just keeps happening
1,@BillyM2k Like thrust on a 🚀!
1,@WholeMarsBlog Next release (10.12) is another step towards all NN’s using surround video &amp; reconciling output to a unified vector space for control code.  Improves complex intersections in heavy traffic.  Many upgrades to core code; so taking longer to debug issues. Probably Wed/Thurs release.
1,@Reuters Copycats!
1,@Teslarati @KlenderJoey This will trend to well over 10 times safer
1,I strongly believe that all managers in a technical area must be technically excellent.   Managers in software must write great software or it’s like being a cavalry captain who can’t ride a horse!
1,@skorusARK We must be doing something right!
1,@kevinmitnick Haha
1,Another Starlink mission completed
1,@mayemusk This rumor originated from a parody account; but got picked up by real media &amp; twitter trends (sigh)
1,@its_menieb So much to be done on layout. Every single pixel matters. Hard problem.
1,If Twitter acquisition completes; company will be super focused on hardcore software engineering; design; infosec &amp; server hardware https://t.co/m2HseK0TXl
1,@WholeMarsBlog I’m a big believer in citizen journalism and following individual journalists over publications!
1,@nypost This is false. I’ve had no communication; directly or indirectly; with Trump; who has publicly stated that he will be exclusively on Truth Social.
1,@mayemusk @newypost I didn’t ask anyone out or request particular seating
1,@CathieDWood Passive/index investment is simply an amplifier of active investment. If active investment signal degrades in quality; passive is proportionately impacted.  Also; if there are very few actual active investors; their decisions can greatly increase company valuation volatility.

1,@slashdot Apple’s store is like having a 30% tax on the Internet. Definitely not ok.
1,@dogecoin_empire I was going full Looney Tunes haha
1,@teslaownersSV @28delayslater Tesla is now over 110k direct jobs and roughly 500k indirect; factoring in suppliers
1,@28delayslater Talked to an NPC with aggro==255
1,@heydave7 Starlink is awesome for RV’s; camping or any activity away from cities
1,@WholeMarsBlog That is why we must clear out bots; spam &amp; scams. Is something actually public opinion or just someone operating 100k fake accounts? Right now; you can’t tell.  And algorithms must be open source; with any human intervention clearly identified.  Then; trust will be deserved.
1,@WholeMarsBlog There is so much potential with Twitter to be the most trusted &amp; broadly inclusive forum in the world!
1,@daelmor Yeah; kids starting with lots of money usually have much less motivation than those who have nothing.   When we started our first company (Zip2) in 95; I had over $100k of student debt; a computer I built myself and a few thousand dollars.

1,@Rainmaker1973 An amazing example of what implanted electrodes can do; even when there are only a few large wires
1,@pmarca Haha he says “Bitcoin” so many times
1,Since I’ve been asked a lot:  Buy stock in several companies that make products &amp; services that *you* believe in.  Only sell if you think their products &amp; services are trending worse. Don’t panic when the market does.  This will serve you well in the long-term.
1,@vallioo @pmarca Munger is correct
1,@TheCaptain_Nemo @pmarca Major problem. Passive/index managers should vote in the best interests of shareholders; not shift responsibility to proxy advisory firms.
1,@pegobry @pmarca Exactly. Right before he died; Jack Bogle (of Vanguard fame) said index/passive funds were too great a percentage of the market and he really knew what he was talking about!   There should be a shift back towards active investment. Passive has gone too far.
1,@pmarca Exactly; decisions are being made on behalf of actual shareholders that are contrary to their interests! Major problem with index/passive funds.
1,@BillyM2k Not a bad idea

1,@PPathole @pmarca A friend just emailed me about her bad Ritalin experience. Best to be cautious with all neurotransmitter drugs.
1,@PPathole @pmarca I have not heard bad things about Ritalin; which is not good to say it’s good; just haven’t heard bad things about it
1,@pmarca Wellbutrin is way worse than Adderall imo. It should be taken off the market.   Every time that drug has come up in conversation; someone at the table has a suicide or near suicide story.

1,@dickc What are talking about? I’m just saying Twitter needs to be politically neutral.
1,For Twitter to deserve public trust; it must be politically neutral; which effectively means upsetting the far right and the far left equally
1,@robbysoave @esaagar The Washington Post targets me relentlessly!   Their insults could be higher quality; but some are not bad. I gave them 3 stars on Yelp.
1,@Erdayastronaut @RubinReport @nytimes @Forbes @SocialBlade Almost every media outlet on Earth wrote about me acquiring Twitter; causing a massive influx of new users
1,@RubinReport @nytimes @Forbes Yeah; I noticed that too. Pretty weird.
1,Should be called Trumpet instead!
1,Truth Social (terrible name) exists because Twitter censored free speech
1,Truth Social is currently beating Twitter &amp; TikTok on the Apple Store https://t.co/RxawVUAYKH
1,@Cernovich Sounds pretty bad …
1,@esaagar Suspending the Twitter account of a major news organization for publishing a truthful story was obviously incredibly inappropriate
1,Raptor 2 rocket engines at Starbase; each producing over half a million pounds (230 tons) of force https://t.co/9ixxXXceG3
1,By “free speech”; I simply mean that which matches the law.   I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law.   If people want less free speech; they will ask government to pass laws to that effect.  Therefore; going beyond the law is contrary to the will of the people.
1,The extreme antibody reaction from those who fear free speech says it all
1,@dogeofficialceo Can someone please give the NPCs a bigger dialogue tree!?

1,@JohnnaCrider1 @stats_feed Underground tunnels are immune to surface weather conditions (subways are a good example); so it wouldn’t matter to Hyperloop if a hurricane was raging on the surface. You wouldn’t even notice.
1,@JohnnaCrider1 @stats_feed In the coming years; Boring Co will attempt to build a working Hyperloop.   From a known physics standpoint; this is the fastest possible way of getting from one city center to another for distances less than ~2000 miles. Starship is faster for longer journeys.
1,@WholeMarsBlog Next beta release has many improvements; especially for complex left turns &amp; heavy traffic

1,@PPathole @JamesWLaw1 @Teslarati @ResidentSponge Getting there
1,@JamesWLaw1 @Teslarati @ResidentSponge Definitely. Might be less than 5 years away; as current version Neuralinks are semi-generalized neural read/write devices with ~1000 electrodes and tinnitus  probably needs &lt;&lt;1000.  Future gen Neuralinks will increase electrode count by many orders of magnitude.
1,@Teslarati @ResidentSponge In the meantime; semaglutide (aka Ozempic/Rybelsus) appears to be effective in appetite control with minor side effects
1,@24_7TeslaNews @Teslarati @ResidentSponge Current generation Neuralinks can help to some degree; but an advanced case of Alzheimers often involves macro degeneration of the brain.   However; Neuralinks should theoretically be able restore almost any functionality lost due *localized* brain damage from stroke or injury.
1,@Teslarati @ResidentSponge If you’ve engineered or manufactured smart watches or phones; please join Neuralink! Your skills are directly applicable.
1,@Teslarati @ResidentSponge It is an electronics/mechanical/software engineering problem for the Neuralink device that is similar in complexity level to smart watches (which are not easy!); plus the surgical robot; which is comparable to state-of-the art CNC machines.  No need for AI/ NN/ML quite yet.

1,@nichegamer Elden Ring is incredible; but why are extremely gory death/murder scenes ok; but panties get you banned!?
1,@BillyM2k 🤣 also why are there still printers?
1,@Teslarati Tesla China is doing incredible work
1,shadow ban council reviewing tweet … https://t.co/cawjtwc7CW
1,in case u need to lose a boner fast https://t.co/fcHiaXKCJi
1,@WholeMarsBlog Yeah; but I didn’t leak it to NYT. They must have got it through friends of friends.   I heard from multiple people at TED that Gates still had half billion short against Tesla; which is why I asked him; so it’s not exactly top secret.
1,@WholeMarsBlog FSD is best in Bay Area; given engineering mostly lives there; but rest of country will soon be at that level
1,@PPathole @teslaownersSV @BillyM2k @engineers_feed Something like that
1,@AlexAndBooks_ Good list
1,@BillyM2k @engineers_feed So many “verified” scam crypto bots!
1,@engineers_feed I will verify you.   The current process for verification is like if Kafka had a Magic 8-Ball!
1,@PPathole I wish we did. Would be better for making life multiplanetary.
1,What is best in life?
1,The Barbarians are at the Gate
1,@teslaownersSV @SpaceX The real tragedy is that tie I’m wearing!
1,@WholeMarsBlog That number should probably be on my gravestone at this point
1,Believe in the future
1,@APompliano Tesla is really a dozen or more startups if you look at all the things created from scratch that aren’t present in other car companies
1,And authenticate all real humans
1,@johnkrausphotos Indeed (heavy sigh)
1,If our twitter bid succeeds; we will defeat the spam bots or die trying!
1,Such a joy to work with amazingly talented people at SpaceX; Tesla; Neuralink &amp; Boring Co!
1,@WholeMarsBlog @Herbert_Diess Diess deserves a lot of credit for moving VW rapidly towards electrification. They’re lucky to have him.
1,@SamTwits My true moral error was creating Tesla &amp; SpaceX at same time; while avoiding general mgmt chores at Tesla (focusing only on product &amp; engineering). Tried to have my cake &amp; eat it too; which failed.
1,@SamTwits Agreed. I wish JB &amp; I had just moved forward to commercialize the Tzero without adding other partners. In the end; that’s what happened anyway.
1,@fermatslibrary Resistance is futile
1,@WholeMarsBlog The esthetics of the new rendering will improve
1,@TPostMillennial SNL is so rarely funny these day (sigh) https://t.co/zYnkLgdDY8
1,@Erdayastronaut Making rocket reuse normal is the goal
1,@BillyM2k Always look on the bright side of life
1,@teslaownersSV @DimaZeniuk @billhuang688 @woonomic @VaibhavSisinty Maybe JB would be up for that too. He deserves a lot of credit (as do many longtime Tesla people).
1,@teslaownersSV @DimaZeniuk @billhuang688 @woonomic @VaibhavSisinty Ok sure
1,@garyblack00 The failures are mine; the successes belong to others
1,@DimaZeniuk @billhuang688 @woonomic @VaibhavSisinty I should; but that would take a lot of time away from Tesla; SpaceX &amp; other work. Walter Isaacson is writing a book.
1,@PPathole @teslaownersSV @woonomic @VaibhavSisinty Exactly
1,@billhuang688 @woonomic @VaibhavSisinty I put in all I had; whereas Eberhard; who was worth over $10M at the time; refused to invest a penny to help Tesla.   If it was really his baby; he would never have stood by while it starved to death.  https://t.co/ZDfYLD5qkL
1,@teslaownersSV @woonomic @VaibhavSisinty But if he was actually capable of creating a company like Tesla; he would have done so after he was fired for lying outrageously about cost &amp; progress of Roadster in mid 2007.  We would’ve lost at least a few talented people if he was the real deal; but we lost no one.
1,@teslaownersSV @woonomic @VaibhavSisinty Eberhard has been relentlessly pushing a false narrative about Tesla for 15 years. He’s a compelling liar. Fooled me for almost 3 years.
1,@woonomic @VaibhavSisinty They say history is written by the victors; but not on Wikipedia if the losing party is still alive &amp; has lots of time on their hands!
1,@woonomic @VaibhavSisinty When Eberhard was fired unanimously by the board in July 2007 (for damn good reasons); no one left with him. That says it all.
1,@woonomic @VaibhavSisinty If filing a shell corp constitutes “founding a company”; then I’d be the only founder of PayPal; since I filed the original incorporation docs for https://t.co/bOUOek5Cvy (later renamed PayPal); but that’s not what founding means.
1,@woonomic @VaibhavSisinty Not even close to that. It was a shell corp with no employees; no IP; no designs; no prototype; literally nothing but a biz plan to commercialize AC Propulsion’s Tzero car; which was introduced to me by JB Straubel; *not* Eberhard.   Even name “Tesla Motors” was owned by others!
1,Please consider working at The Boring Company!   Our goal is to solve traffic; which plagues every major city on Earth.
1,@Erdayastronaut Hopefully; I didn’t say too many dumb things
1,@WholeMarsBlog Tesla opex is embarrassingly high imo!
1,@garyblack00 @MartinViecha $1T valuation with $0 advertising spend
1,@BillyM2k @nichegamer @slashdot Does it accurately portray software engineers?
1,@SawyerMerritt Yeah
1,@Teslarati @13ericralph31 Had to been done
1,_______ is the Night
1,@nichegamer @slashdot Can they please just make sci-fi/fantasy at least *mostly* about sci-fi/fantasy?
1,@nichegamer @slashdot True
1,@akheriaty I love Pinball Wizard! https://t.co/h3psi9XFlT
1,@PPathole Absolutely
1,@slashdot The woke mind virus is making Netflix unwatchable
1,A social media platform’s policies are good if the most extreme 10% on left and right are equally unhappy
1,@pmarca Extremely concerning. Who is pushing this censorship/deplatforming? Very shadowy.
1,SpaceX Falcon team making great progress! Aiming for 5 day launch cadence with many performance &amp; refurb improvements.
1,Why; thank you; sir!  https://t.co/tealJWLSdP
1,@garyblack00 Board salary will be $0 if my bid succeeds; so that’s ~$3M/year saved right there
1,@ICannot_Enough @jaylew333 Since he is consistently wrong; it should be possible to do quite well simply by doing the opposite of what he recommends
1,@TrungTPhan @TEDchris I feel it’s important that one’s hat also have a hat. Long-standing belief.
1,@teslaownersSV @Tesla I used to be such a snappy dresser!
1,@Erdayastronaut I think my clothes are too big for me
1,@itsALLrisky @gigadgets_ I love it; sign me up
1,@gigadgets_ Sounds high
1,@TEDchris I should probably stop cutting my own hair haha
1,@TEDchris Good interview
1,Happy Easter! https://t.co/3gBFlrPOQO
1,Smooth landing video
1,@WholeMarsBlog Based on feedback received; we will drop mobile connector price to $200 &amp; make it easy to order with car.   Note; mobile connector is not needed if you have a Tesla wall connector or to use Superchargers.  Recommend installing Tesla wall connector well before car arrives.
1,@WSBChairman In fairness to the Twitter board; this might be more of a concern about other potential bidders vs just me
1,@WholeMarsBlog Usage statistics were super low; so seemed wasteful. On the (minor) plus side; we will be including more plug adapters with the mobile connector kit.
1,🎶 Love Me Tender 🎶
1,@ChrisJBakke Wow; with Jack departing; the Twitter board collectively owns almost no shares! Objectively; their economic interests are simply not aligned with shareholders.
1,@waitbutwhy Civilization; as defined by the invention of writing; is only ~5500 years old https://t.co/SMHYvKN2sd
1,@DavidSacks Indeed
1,@lrocket @TonyeFreeman Thanks for teaching me so much about rocket engines!
1,@yishan My most immediate takeaway from this novella of a thread is that Twitter is *way* overdue for long form tweets!
1,@BillyM2k As I was saying …
1,@vladtenev 6 seconds; better said as 6000 milliseconds; which is a long time to computers; is about right
1,@cameron If the current Twitter board takes actions contrary to shareholder interests; they would be breaching their fiduciary duty.   The liability they would thereby assume would be titanic in scale.
1,@Cernovich Good question
1,Taking Twitter private at $54.20 should be up to shareholders; not the board
1,@PoliticalShort @Twitter Absolutely. It would be utterly indefensible not to put this offer to a shareholder vote. They own the company; not the board of directors.
1,@Alwaleed_Talal @Twitter @Kingdom_KHC Interesting. Just two questions; if I may.   How much of Twitter does the Kingdom own; directly &amp; indirectly?  What are the Kingdom’s views on journalistic freedom of speech?
1,Will endeavor to keep as many shareholders in privatized Twitter as allowed by law
1,I made an offer  https://t.co/VvreuPMeLu
1,@JeffBezos Great idea
1,@BLKMDL3 Coming soon
1,@tesla_raj Exciting times ahead
1,@pmarca Disconnected from what it takes to make stuff
1,@teslaownersSV I’m serious about this one btw
1,@sweatystartup Exactly
1,@PPathole Price should probably be ~$2/month; but paid 12 months up front &amp; account doesn’t get checkmark for 60 days (watch for CC chargebacks) &amp; suspended with no refund if used for scam/spam
1,@PPathole It should go away or scammers will game the system by signing up only for a few months
1,@GonzaAbalos Maybe even an option to pay in Doge?
1,@GonzaAbalos Yes; should be proportionate to affordability &amp; in local currency
1,@BLKMDL3 Exactly. It would massively expand the verified pool &amp; make bot armies too expensive to maintain.
1,@michaeljburry You will get it back; even though you shorted Tesla; you bastard 🤣
1,Weather is fake. I seen Truman Show!
1,@teslaownersSV The resemblance is uncanny https://t.co/egFdUWso7Q
1,@LPofMN As the saying goes; when the government first prints money; everyone feels like a winner; but in the end no one does
1,@siddarthpaim Fake news purveyors would have hysterics; but a ratings system would improve quality of news greatly
1,@universal_sci All of Earth is a tiny dust mote compared to the Sun
1,69.420% of statistics are false
1,Truth is the first casualty. https://t.co/cN9PIfDvjr
1,@Jason @justinbieber Yeah
1,@WholeMarsBlog @jspeedymorris22 @darrenrovell Absolutely
1,@jspeedymorris22 @darrenrovell Now subtract crypto scam accounts that twitter constantly shows as “real” people in everyone’s feed
1,And @justinbieber only posted once this entire year
1,For example; @taylorswift13 hasn’t posted anything in 3 months
1,Most of these “top” accounts tweet rarely and post very little content.   Is Twitter dying?
1,Interesting
1,@PPathole @stats_feed We have some cool ideas for sustainable lithium extraction &amp; refinement
1,@PPathole @stats_feed True
1,@stats_feed Price of lithium has gone to insane levels! Tesla might actually have to get into the mining &amp; refining directly at scale; unless costs improve.  There is no shortage of the element itself; as lithium is almost everywhere on Earth; but pace of extraction/refinement is slow.
1,@EvaFoxU @vincent13031925 Team did amazing work!
1,@teslaownersSV I mean … that’s a lot of hamsters 🐹
1,@Rainmaker1973 Smooth video courtesy of bolting Starlinks to the deck. They are able to handle high vibration &amp; acoustics.

1,Preparing … https://t.co/Rb21R1ZDhN
1,I will give a talk around 9
1,🇺🇸🇺🇸 Gigafactory Texas 🇺🇸🇺🇸  Grand opening party tomorrow!  Doors open at 4; festivities at 8
1,@remedygames Great games
1,@StockMKTNewz No sale took place. Initial share number filed was incorrect.
1,@RealWheelieman @WholeMarsBlog Increasingly likely that the Tesla vehicle computer will be able to process 288 FPS (36 Hz * 8 cameras)
1,@RealWheelieman @WholeMarsBlog 10.12 will significantly improve unprotected left turns
1,@Rainmaker1973 The power used by humans is so tiny compared to how much power from the Sun reaches Earth!  Solar power is ~1GW per sq km. At current solar efficiency; net electrical power is ~200 MW per square km.  The entire United States can be powered by a small corner of Texas.
1,@pmarca @skepticaliblog Yikes
1,@pmarca WaPo always good for a laugh 🤣🤣
1,@jack Thanks Jack!
1,@paraga Looking forward to working with Parag &amp; Twitter board to make significant improvements to Twitter in coming months!
1,@PPathole @Erdayastronaut Yeah; single most annoying problem on twitter imo
1,@Erdayastronaut That sounds reasonable
1,@boztank @Liz_Wheeler Facebook gives me the willies
1,@OstynHyss @stevenmarkryan That is harder than a boss battle in DS3!
1,@stevenmarkryan I mean; if the people vote overwhelmingly for something; it is at least *a* data point!
1,Do you want an edit button?
1,@hausman_k @GoogleAI Staggeringly unfunny
1,@WholeMarsBlog First I’ve learned of this. Will be patched shortly.
1,@slashdot Spain should build a massive solar array. Could power all of Europe.
1,Oh hi lol
1,Berlin rocks
1,@Erdayastronaut @Tesla Raptor pump power is over 100MW per engine &amp; 33 engines; means over 3GW. Not even remotely possible for electric motors &amp; batteries to compete.
1,@GerberKawasaki We aim for 30% GM or ~10% profitability; all costs included
1,@PopMech Good summary
1,@JuicyCreativ3 George Lucas once told me that the only reason Star Wars got made is because the old studio heads died
1,@JuicyCreativ3 Old people don’t change their minds; with rare exception; they just die. Without death; there would not be change.
1,I am inspired by curiosity.   That is what drives me.   So let us expand the scope &amp; scale of consciousness so that we may aspire to understand the Universe.
1,@WholeMarsBlog There will come a time in the future where people will be surprised that we let practically anyone drive a 2 ton death machine anywhere they want
1,Peace. Peace?  I hate the word. Those who do care about peace (myself aspirationally included) don’t need to hear it. And those who don’t care about peace? Well …
1,@Kristennetten @PPathole @engineers_feed I look kinda dumb in that pic haha
1,@PPathole @engineers_feed And Shakespeare had no surviving descendants
1,@pmarca I am increasingly convinced that corporate ESG is the Devil Incarnate
1,@engineers_feed He never had even one kid 😞
1,@lexfridman Seriously. One of them might been Einstein!
1,I’m talking about not having kids in the first place. That’s the problem.
1,But we should
1,Humanity did not evolve to mourn the unborn
1,@MuseZack @pmarca Exactly
1,They wrote PEACE on the wall at Berghain! I refused enter.
1,@praetorianlabs This might be gearing up to be literally the biggest party on Earth
1,@SawyerMerritt @Tesla This was an *exceptionally* difficult quarter due to supply chain interruptions &amp; China zero Covid policy.  Outstanding work by Tesla team &amp; key suppliers saved the day.
1,@PPathole Starship is the key to making life multiplanetary &amp; protecting the light of consciousness
1,@mharrisonair Well said
1,@DjKeyWay Definitely not right that the other officers were charged with nothing. What message does this send in general to officers who stand by while another does wrong? #JusticeForGeorge
1,@scale_banana @engineers_feed Where’s the banana!?

1,@TeslaTested Probably
1,Dragon docks with @Space_Station in ~3 hours
1,@NASA @SpaceX @AstroBehnken @Astro_Doug @Space_Station Dragonship Endeavor
1,5 mins to T-0
1,@engineers_feed Falcon/Dragon are designed to withstand multiple lightning strikes; but we don’t think it would be wise to take this risk
1,@Commercial_Crew @NASA @SpaceX Proceeding with countdown today; weather cancellation risk ~50%
1,@cleantechnica Worth noting that; as of Jan 1; Tesla buyers no longer received any federal tax credit. Model 3 led despite this disadvantage.
1,@Erdayastronaut @vincent13031925 We slowed down a bit to allow Supercharger V3 production to get going; but now will speed up!

1,@Virgin_Orbit Sorry to hear that. Orbit is hard. Took us four attempts with Falcon 1.
1,@TheRealBuzz @SpaceX @NASA Thanks Buzz!
1,The @Space_Station is circling Earth at 25 times the speed of sound
1,@jimkwik @jadescipioni No problem
1,@PPathole @TheOnion Cute as a button
1,@TheOnion Fallout New Omaha
1,@jadescipioni @jimkwik His ideas sound sensible; but he was not my or SpaceX’s “brain coach”. I think he maybe gave a talk once.
1,@JonErlichman 5 years ago. We need to accelerate progress towards fully reusable rockets. Cost per ton to orbit needs to improve by &gt;1000% from where Falcon is today for there to be a self-sustaining city on Mars.
1,@Erdayastronaut @NASA @SpaceX Mars needs to happen soon
1,Made on Earth by humans
1,@cbs_spacenews @NASASpaceflight Cool
1,@RyanMaue @flcnhvy @jayleno Pretty much
1,@flcnhvy @jayleno Reviewed design with Franz last night. Even 3% smaller is too small. Will be pretty much this size. We’ll probably do a smaller; tight world truck at some point.
1,@flcnhvy Haha true! Hard to convey tone in tweets. Many people would probably be a lot less upset if they heard me speak the words.

1,@DanielleFong @ThieveryCorpDC Totally. Collective mind control by stoking fear.
1,@jonnajarian Yes; improvement is exponential
1,@Jennerator211 Yeah. Maybe following individual journalists &amp; citizen journalists is better than publications. The Onion may be the best mainstream media source. Hard to figure out what’s actually going on in the world!
1,It’s remarkable how often The News attempts to answer the question: what is the worst thing that happened on Earth today?
1,@crystaloftruth @Newsweek Still am
1,@crystaloftruth @Newsweek More or less crazy than reality itself?
1,@lavvphotography @Newsweek It’s next-level for sure. Reality is getting weird fast.
1,@Oh_Gee_Man Famous last words
1,@Newsweek I said run for office; not president (sigh). Who even owns Newsweek these days? I lost track.
1,@Teslarati Boring Co will also connect Vegas hotels &amp; airport. Autonomous Teslas in tunnels will provide individualized mass transit.
1,@flcnhvy We’re going to have to push out the date or attendance will be very low. Maybe do in two parts: webcast next month &amp; in-person event a few months later?

1,@AntonTonchev77 @SciGuySpace True (sigh)
1,@AdamDavidHalsey @devonwerkharder Seriously; Big Candy is suppressing R&amp;D! When’s the last time you heard of a great new candy bar?
1,@franksdcaudill He was critical of large bureaucracies &amp; Napoleon III was indeed a knucklehead
1,@ylecun @an_open_mind @jjvincent Fair point; PyTorch is great!
1,@devonwerkharder Capitalism already has many fetters in the form of a plethora of regulatory bodies! I’m definitely against any monopolies/oligopolies where there is a low forcing function for improving customer happiness or an unpriced externality that consumes a common good (eg emissions).
1,@Tallest0ne Probably sooner
1,@ReidarSundy @TheZenCorner @stoolpresidente This is happening a lot
1,@MMelinot That would be cool!
1,@vistacruiser7 @flcnhvy Very much agree!
1,@nichegamer 🤣🤣 Along with several guillotine death threats!
1,Boring Company completes 2nd Vegas tunnel
1,In his 18th Brumaire essay (in which he does make some good points); Marx famously said history repeats itself; first as tragedy; then as farce. This is now ironically happening with Marxism.
1,@CodingMark @ResistMonsters @TheZenCorner @stoolpresidente Exactly
1,@flcnhvy Tesla makes the safest cars in the world &amp; our factory injury rate is better than industry avg &amp; tracking to be better than any auto plant in North America. We care deeply about safety at a fundamental level.
1,@flcnhvy SpaceX has 8000 employees in California; Washington; Texas &amp; Florida. Operating this entire time; as we have national security exemption. Zero deaths or serious illnesses.
1,@flcnhvy Absolutely. Tesla already went through this in China with 7000 employees. Zero fatalities or serious illnesses.
1,@TheZenCorner @stoolpresidente The statistics stopped being valid when anyone with “covid symptoms”; which is now almost anything; was counted as having covid
1,@stoolpresidente Well said! Please run for office. The politicians &amp; unelected bureaucrats who stole our liberty should be tarred; feathered &amp; thrown out of town!

1,@flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @jack This is getting annoying. Honestly; I’m not sure it’s even helping their scam!
1,@Crusade4change @realDonaldTrump Those who always disagree have a closed mind … but; by their very nature; that won’t sink in (sigh)
1,@thirdrowtesla It’s not often that the Governor of California &amp; the President agree!
1,@AlexBerenson It appears that what he is saying is untrue
1,@archillect Lil baby
1,@WolvesSuperfan Great
1,@Johnnaaaaaaaaaa Wow; great writing!
1,@KenJennings All other car companies are allowed to manufacture *except* Tesla; you knucklehead. No wonder you got crushed by a computer the size of a pizza box.
1,@teslaownersSV Much appreciated!
1,That’s pretty much what happened https://t.co/5Enzgt20q7
1,@Alex_ADEdge @NASASpaceflight Pretty close. It will look absurdly tall &amp; have a lot more ground support equipment.
1,@alandail Haggerty actually admitted to NYT that he told his staff to “slow down” Tesla for reasons that had nothing to do with health. Unreal …
1,@flcnhvy @thehill @GavinNewsom Exactly
1,@thehill Don’t mislead the public. State said YES; an unelected county official is the problem. Tesla factory in adjacent San Joaquin county is fully operational.
1,Tesla is restarting production today against Alameda County rules. I will be on the line with everyone else. If anyone is arrested; I ask that it only be me.
1,@ChillMichelle @Tesla Yes; California approved; but an unelected county official illegally overrode. Also; all other auto companies in US are approved to resume. Only Tesla has been singled out. This is super messed up!

1,@TeslaTested @LegendaryEnergy Absolutely. Moreover; they don’t even need to be tested for covid; just need “covid-like symptoms”; which is a long list; including “feeling weakness”. Hard to die *without* feeling weakness!
1,@GovKemp Georgia lifted lockdown 15 days ago
1,@LegendaryEnergy He is right
1,@WorldAndScience We are a pattern of atoms
1,@cleantechnica Pretty much
1,@flcnhvy @AlamedaCounty @Tesla Exactly
1,SN4 passed high pressure (7.5 bar) &amp; engine thrust load at cryo
1,@mayemusk @Grimezsz @christianamusk ❤️ u Mom
1,@RBReich Sorry
1,@thirdrowtesla @Tesla @AlamedaCounty @ACSOSheriffs @Dare2BWell I’m not messing around. Absurd &amp; medically irrational behavior in violation of constitutional civil liberties; moreover by *unelected* county officials with no accountability; needs to stop.
1,@adrianfine @Tesla @cityofpaloalto Much appreciated; Mayor Fine!
1,@teslaownersSV @GerberKawasaki @thirdrowtesla @AlamedaCounty Thanks Mayor Mei! https://t.co/YFJSGd3Emp
1,@vincent13031925 @GerberKawasaki @thirdrowtesla Absolutely
1,@teslaownersSV @GerberKawasaki @thirdrowtesla Please voice your disagreement as strongly as possible with @AlamedaCounty
1,@TeslaOwnersEBay @GerberKawasaki @thirdrowtesla Yes; already done
1,@bradd_libby Tesla is the biggest manufacturer in California &amp; second biggest exporter
1,@KristiRJensen @EverydayElon @SjvTesla @GerberKawasaki @thirdrowtesla Exactly! Tesla knows far more about what needs to be done to be safe through our Tesla China factory experience than an (unelected) interim junior official in Alameda County.
1,@EverydayElon @SjvTesla @GerberKawasaki @thirdrowtesla Absolutely; please do! You should be allowed to recoup damages from the county.
1,@SjvTesla @GerberKawasaki @thirdrowtesla San Joaquin County; right next door to Alameda; has been sensible &amp; reasonable; whereas Alameda has been irrational &amp; detached from reality. Our castings foundry and other faculties in San Joaquin have been working 24/7 this entire time with no ill effects. Same with Giga Nevada.
1,@GerberKawasaki @thirdrowtesla Frankly; this is the final straw. Tesla will now move its HQ and future programs to Texas/Nevada immediately. If we even retain Fremont manufacturing activity at all; it will be dependen on how Tesla is treated in the future. Tesla is the last carmaker left in CA.
1,@GerberKawasaki @thirdrowtesla Tesla is filing a lawsuit against Alameda County immediately. The unelected &amp; ignorant “Interim Health Officer” of Alameda is acting contrary to the Governor; the President; our Constitutional freedoms &amp; just plain common sense!
1,@mattduplessis No; I have a license!
1,@engineers_feed B-nut 🤣
1,Half a 🐝; philosophically; must ipso facto half not 🐝
1,@sara_boutall @28delayslater @Kristennetten @RenataKonkoly @Johnnaaaaaaaaaa @MichaelGalanin @Physicsastrono9 @fermatslibrary @MAstronomers @engineers_feed Turns out hobbits are enormous
1,Once again; I must recommend https://t.co/7XelSWHDzd
1,@thesheetztweetz @SpaceX @USCG @PortCanaveral Glad we could help
1,@JoshManuel It’s true
1,@Erdayastronaut @thirdrowtesla @mayemusk Coming soon
1,@thirdrowtesla @Erdayastronaut @mayemusk Yes; this is a high priority
1,@Johnnaaaaaaaaaa @Kristennetten @thirdrowtesla @mayemusk Operating on a prime directive of crash avoidance; it could automatically intervene when crash probability is approaching 100%
1,@OfficialAPoD @joerogan Pain can certainly be turned off; but we’re not sure what the best initial test case (max goodness for least risk to patient) would be quite yet
1,@Kristennetten @thirdrowtesla @mayemusk Teslas automatically maintain their internal temperature to within safe limits in case a pet or child is left in the car
1,@IvanEscobosa @thirdrowtesla @mayemusk That’s harder than it sounds. Will check with team.
1,@sspencer_smb @flcnhvy It’s not all about engineering; although that is my personal favorite. Striving to make products or provide services in excess of what you consume is the noble goal.
1,@flcnhvy To be clear; I do think finance &amp; law are important; but too many smart people in the US go into those fields. Also; too many MBAs.
1,@raytech247 @flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @ValkyrieBaron11 @NASASpaceflight Yes; mostly because you can use the ship every week going to the moon instead of every two years for Mars (best case)
1,@flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @ValkyrieBaron11 @NASASpaceflight Would be about 10 times that cost for payload to surface of Mars
1,@flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @ValkyrieBaron11 @NASASpaceflight Starship + Super Heavy propellant mass is 4800 tons (78% O2 &amp; 22% CH4). I think we can get propellant cost down to ~$100/ton in volume; so ~$500k/flight. With high flight rate; probably below $1.5M fully burdened cost for 150 tons to orbit or ~$10/kg.
1,@clairlemon @Quillette A mandatory tracing app would be insane
1,@AndrewFosterWa1 @KillaSarg @Erdayastronaut @ElonHarith @flcnhvy @NASASpaceflight True
1,@teslaownersSV @vincent13031925 @joerogan Probably makes sense to have a “Details” section of the app that mirrors everything in the car. Would also allow phone to be used in lieu of car screen if car screen faults for any reason.
1,@vincent13031925 @joerogan Franz and I do have absurdly similar tastes 🤣🤣
1,@Godmiller1 @Johnnaaaaaaaaaa @EvaFoxU @Tesla Would cover latitude of London
1,@TesLatino Peak rate of about half that for version 1 is about right; but heavily dependent on users per cell. Aiming for latency under 20 ms.
1,@Johnnaaaaaaaaaa @EvaFoxU @Tesla It will only work for higher latitudes (Seattle) at first; then get progressively closer to the equator
1,@Johnnaaaaaaaaaa @EvaFoxU @Tesla Sure :)
1,@EvaFoxU @Tesla Way more important than it sounds
1,@GavinNewsom Yeah!!
1,@Erdayastronaut @ValkyrieBaron11 @flcnhvy @NASASpaceflight A fully &amp; rapidly reusable orbital rocket is fundamental to extending life beyond Earth. Propellant cost is roughly a 1000th of vehicle cost (unless using a foolish propellant). Same principle as cars; planes; boats; etc.
1,@Erdayastronaut @ElonHarith @flcnhvy @NASASpaceflight SLS makes me feel sad
1,@WhatsupFranks @NASASpaceflight No; they will be smashed beyond repair &amp; corroded
1,@flcnhvy @NASASpaceflight Yeah; although hydrogen is not a great choice for a booster engine
1,@ABauerle5 A great mystery of the universe
1,@NASASpaceflight It’s so tragic that these engines just crash into the ocean every flight
1,@flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla @YoavOffek Roundabouts no problem; but dodging distracted human drivers very tricky!
1,@PPathole @Erdayastronaut @farrier_nyker @GeetPurohit3 @YoavOffek Looks about right. Ice mining/refining  on Mars &amp; maximizing total system efficiency will be hard. CO2 is easy; as Mars atmosphere is mostly that. Also has good amount of N2; which is important for life.
1,@Erdayastronaut @YoavOffek In this case; just chilling the gas back to liquid
1,@Erdayastronaut @farrier_nyker @GeetPurohit3 @YoavOffek Yes; converts CO2 &amp; H2O to CH4 &amp; O2. Perfect for Mars! https://t.co/WF9AGgee12
1,@Erdayastronaut @YoavOffek Flare stack flamed out. In a few weeks we’ll be recondensing methane using solar power; so no flare stack.
1,@thirdrowtesla @YoavOffek Turns on city street intersections is the big one
1,@YoavOffek Yes. Static fire feeding from fuel header vs main tank.
1,@geekwire Not SpaceX
1,@thirdrowtesla His son sounds great btw
1,@PPathole @InSpaceXItrust @Space_Station @Tesla @SpaceX @Commercial_Crew 2008 was a super tough year on all levels
1,@thirdrowtesla Tesla &amp; SpaceX are the top two destinations for engineers; because you can have the most fun creating kickass technology! That’s why.
1,@PicklePunchD @BBCScienceNews Good for them! About half the US will be mostly open by this weekend.
1,@InSpaceXItrust @Space_Station @Tesla @SpaceX @Commercial_Crew That was the whole company back then. Grew organically from a simple mariachi party in El Segundo.

1,@LauraBockov @subeiwoo @JoshSchoen @AlexBerenson @neil_ferguson There would be time-stamped video if this were true
1,@JimBridenstine @TomCruise @Space_Station @NASA Should be a lot of fun!
1,@Gfilche @Tesla There are many pieces to the puzzle
1,@enn_nafnlaus @tmornini @bouncygulag @Param86330798 @Grimezsz DKE in a nutshell: we’re almost always dumber than we think we are
1,@WhatsupFranks @alexmd2 @slashdot @NYGovCuomo That would be awesome
1,@subeiwoo @JoshSchoen @AlexBerenson @neil_ferguson This is false. JD’s team put out “video evidence”; but conveniently excluded the date stamp; as it was well after JD &amp; AH had separated.
1,@teslaownersSV @slashdot Yeah; definitely a future feature
1,@martinvars @GavinNewsom Levitt rocks
1,@slashdot Important to distinguish died with covid vs died because of covid. Also; distinguish between tested positive for covid or only had symptoms.
1,@AlexBerenson @neil_ferguson Thanks! Something more should be done. This guy has caused massive strife to the world with his absurdly fake “science”.
1,@AlexBerenson @neil_ferguson What a tool
1,@PicklePunchD @Jason @TeslaGong @PPathole @priscillabanana Nope. Thanks!
1,@Jason @TeslaGong @PPathole @priscillabanana Thanks :) Never too young for some ink haha
1,@Gaelic_Neilson Mom &amp; baby all good
1,@Gaelic_Neilson A few hours away!
1,@cleantechnica Anyway; we’re just talking about 2% here; so not much. Confident Model S will get 400+ miles as soon as retest is allowed.
1,@cleantechnica Weird that EPA would deny this. We have precise car logs that confirm it happened. Happy to provide them.
1,@Erdayastronaut @SciGuySpace I hope anything lands
1,@NASASpaceflight @TesLatino @Erdayastronaut It seems unlikely right now
1,@TesLatino @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight Mostly accurate. Liquid CH4 temp got too high this time. Offloading propellant. Will we retry later today.

1,@Rustybret Online
1,Well said; Lord Sumption; well said!
1,@thirdrowtesla Ok; we will
1,@tobyliiiiiiiiii @Kristennetten Yes; about a month away from testing Raptor Vacuum
1,@Kristennetten A little. Will have 31 engines; not 37; no big fins and legs similar to ship. That thrust dome is the super hard part. Raptor SL thrust starts at 200 ton; but upgrades in the works for 250 ton.
1,Anyone think they can get a good multiplayer Minecraft working on Teslas? Or maybe create a game that interacts virtually with reality like Pokémon Go while driving safely? Like a complex version of Pac-man or Mario Kart?

1,@flcnhvy @NASASpaceflight Yes; switching soon to a 300 series alloy with higher ductility at cryogenic temp. 301 is good as sheet; but not as plate. Also; a lot of geometric changes.
1,@kulpability @NASASpaceflight Successive iteration of both design &amp; manufacturing. Latter is 1000% harder than former.
1,@NASASpaceflight It’s a little dicey tbh. Thrust dome is being redesigned. Current one has four separate layers of steel in some places!
1,@Cardoso Physically ready in a few weeks. Approvals may take longer.

1,@PPathole @CBSNewYork @AielloTV Great
1,@CBSNewYork @AielloTV Heard same from doc I trust
1,@yourfavgas @justpaulinelol No; good chance of RUD (rapid unscheduled disassembly) event; but landing pad is separated from launch pad
1,@justpaulinelol That basically describes SoC 0 vs SoC 1 of our FSD computer right now. Soon to change!
1,So often true 🤣🤣 https://t.co/qxmDtZ4Buf
1,@brendan2908 @BocaChicaGal @NASASpaceflight Improved process I was referring to was cylinder to cylinder circumferential welds to improve cycle time &amp; reduce pucker. Those are still working their way through production.
1,@PPathole Great labeling tools &amp; talented human labelers really matter. It really is a skilled profession! Importance of good tools &amp; infrastructure is underrated.
1,@jh_csquared @AlexBrendel2 @Erdayastronaut As usual for most things; building production system for Raptor is &gt;1000% harder than designing it
1,@RenataKonkoly @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX It’s also because of the Spitfire engine &amp; wizard
1,@PPathole Pretty much. Being better than human drivers on average is not a super high standard. Autonomy will probably be held to a 300% to 1000% higher safety requirement long-term.
1,@jgrano305 @thirdrowtesla @cleantechnica Progress is good
1,@thirdrowtesla @cleantechnica Definitely
1,@cleantechnica Many talented engineers are working on FSD at Tesla. What matters is solving vision at high frame rate in our compute space with low latency between camera frame &amp; actuation.
1,@DMC_Ryan @RenataKonkoly Sure; we can probably do an update later this year
1,@Kristennetten @PPathole @alexanderbittan @shelbiestrykers Needs to be more than halfway to east coast

1,Starship SN4 tank on test stand https://t.co/zN2OmMp1OS
1,@WhatsupFranks Yes; same results are showing up pretty much everywhere on Earth. Contagion is higher in high pop density cities &amp; mortality proportionate to age.
1,Silver lining is that mortality rate is much lower than predicted &amp; herd immunity much higher. Good news.
1,@ajtourville @psidart @TOGregTO Maybe Cybertruck will have it …
1,@psidart @TOGregTO I’m dying to do super efficient; quiet home HVAC with HEPA &amp; water distillation. It’s weird; but I really want to do it.
1,@westcoastbill Good one
1,@jgrano305 @teslaownersSV @TOGregTO Will talk with team. We have a lot on our plate!
1,@teslaownersSV @TOGregTO Side camera view looks a little weird; as meant for self-driving; but will review with team. Image will need a little post-processing.
1,@TOGregTO That is more reasonable; especially if mostly loans. Oil &amp; gas is an important industry without which civilization could not function at this time; but financial support should be proportionate to rest of economy.
1,@TheOnion So shall we all
1,@Erdayastronaut Haha sure
1,@Teslarati Good summary
1,@MFrunker @teslaownersSV @CodingMark @JosephVVallace @Kristennetten @thirdrowtesla @Tesla Coming soon

1,@teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @thirdrowtesla @Tesla Maybe just make Joe Mode quieter?
1,@flcnhvy Private beta begins in ~3 months; public beta in ~6 months; starting with high latitudes
1,In advance of this; please try to hack Starlink &amp; Tesla Mothership!
1,There are now 420 operational Starlink satellites 🛰 😉
1,@PPathole @Supernova_Style New York seeing same results for invasive ventilators as Wuhan https://t.co/yYrjwWwixl
1,@skorusARK Pretty much. We place high value on simulation too; but nothing’s as weird as reality!
1,@TesLatino @flcnhvy @anime_virus @thirdrowtesla @MFrunker @SpaceX It’s made of a special dark foam that’s extremely radio transparent; so as not to affect the phased array antennas. Looks a lot like a car sun visor.
1,@Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @anime_virus @thirdrowtesla @MFrunker Solar panel angle during orbit raise / park. We’re fixing it now.
1,@yourfavgas @julia_bergeron @NASASpaceflight Small amount of isopropyl alcohol (cleaning fluid) was trapped in a sensor dead leg &amp; ignited in flight
1,@julia_bergeron @NASASpaceflight Sure hope so!
1,@TOGregTO Frankly; much of the stimulus money is questionable; but this much to oil &amp; gas seems especially so
1,@TOGregTO Not the greatest use of money
1,@anime_virus @flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla @MFrunker If this launch succeeds; we will have put up 422 satellites …
1,@thirdrowtesla @MFrunker Thanks! We are taking some key steps to reduce satellite brightness btw. Should be much less noticeable during orbit raise by changing solar panel angle &amp; all sats get sunshades starting with launch 9.
1,@thirdrowtesla @MFrunker Makes sense
1,@nichegamer Nice
1,@jgrano305 @PPathole @Supernova_Style Anything surprising?
1,@PPathole @Supernova_Style Numbers I was told from Wuhan were 80% to 90% mortality rate for invasive ventilators. Those are not good odds.
1,@Supernova_Style No kidding …
1,@ChrisG_NSF @NASASpaceflight Good article
1,@PPathole @AnnieW Am in Boca working on the rocket with an awesome team; so pretty great :)

1,@teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @thirdrowtesla @Tesla Thinking about this …

1,Best political platform ever https://t.co/CRbNFdQj4B
1,@Erdayastronaut @teslaownersSV @NASA SpaceX has a lot of experience berthing &amp; now docking with @Space_Station; which is very difficult. Orbital refilling should in theory be easier; since Starships dock with themselves &amp; will be uncrewed at first.
1,@RationalEtienne @teslaownersSV @Erdayastronaut Great platform 🤣🤣
1,@teslaownersSV @Erdayastronaut Fully reusable orbital rocket; then orbital refilling; then Mars
1,@Peter_J_Beck @thesheetztweetz @ulalaunch @torybruno @SpaceX 10% would be impressive. Anything below a 20% payload hit would be outstanding.
1,@Erdayastronaut I sure hope so! This will inspire the world &amp; get people excited about the future; just as Apollo did. It wasn’t just that a few people went to the moon; they went there for all humankind.
1,@WhatsupFranks @flcnhvy Another reason reported mortality rate is overstated is that dying *with* covid is not same as dying *from* covid. Media keeps reporting former; not latter.
1,@InSpaceXItrust @jgrano305 Maybe 1.5% change to interior dimensions. Still very roomy.
1,@jgrano305 Probably 3 to 6 months
1,@flcnhvy Moreover; there is mounting evidence that invasive is suboptimal for covid. If they put Boris Johnson on mask ventilator; but *not* invasive; that tells you something! This article incorrectly conflates invasive as “ventilator”; but makes many good points https://t.co/5cPQ29wOvu
1,@flcnhvy You’d think they’d at least be Wikipedia-level informed about ventilators! It clearly articulates the difference between invasive &amp; non-invasive. It’s very misleading to the public to claim that only the invasive type are “real ventilators”. https://t.co/wHkAQ9177V

1,@bluemoondance74 @MichaelCanary02 @Erdayastronaut @dwesterster Raptor is going through many development tests. Merlin is doing acceptance tests; as the design is stable. Depending on how you count them; there are about 6 engine stands operating in parallel.
1,@tobyliiiiiiiiii @MichaelCanary02 @Erdayastronaut @dwesterster No; as the header tanks are quite small relative to main (~30 tons vs 1200 tons). Only uses very tip of the nose.
1,@MichaelCanary02 @Erdayastronaut @dwesterster No; oxygen header tank in nose is important to keep center of mass forward during atmospheric entry
1,@Erdayastronaut @dwesterster Similar; but seemingly small changes can have surprisingly big effects
1,@jgrano305 @AusTeslaOwners Should be available as an in app purchase next month
1,@AusTeslaOwners You’re right; will fix
1,@TeslaGong @vincent13031925 @flcnhvy Good point. Yeah; Remdesivir is sounding very promising!
1,Orbital human spaceflight returns to the Cape in six weeks!
1,@vincent13031925 @flcnhvy Advertising salespeople dressed as truth tellers
1,@Erdayastronaut @dwesterster Trying have fewer parts; so strakes are unlikely. Some very counterintuitive CFD results in both hypersonic &amp; subsonic regimes. Starship does controlled falling more than flying.
1,@Erdayastronaut @dwesterster Flaps; actuator &amp; static aero are undergoing redesign for mass reduction &amp; simplicity
1,@CovelloMassimo @Tesla Will do
1,@flcnhvy True
1,@Erdayastronaut @dwesterster Exactly
1,Good progress; but 18 years to launch our first humans is a long time. Technology must advance faster or there will be no city on the red planet in our lifetime. https://t.co/IsICexqxtV
1,@Teslarati Pretty much; although we also sent some Medtronic units; which are meant for extreme situations. Those require a lot of work to set up &amp; operate. Should be used sparingly. SpaceX is making the valve at the heart of that system.
1,@AngelNDevil2 @S_Padival @fourthrowtesla @TESLAcharts It’s a hard problem; mostly due to esthetics; but it’s the future we should have
1,@Kristennetten @TeslaGong @mattkalin @kimbal Reviewing overall system with vehicle engineering team next week. Should have number then.
1,@jgrano305 @TeslaGong @mattkalin @kimbal Reduced size by ~3%; center line is more level &amp; lower window sill height
1,@TeslaGong @mattkalin @kimbal All new
1,@neiltyson It is about 10% too small; but lots of fun 😀
1,@mattkalin @kimbal We’re working on increasing dynamic air suspension travel for better off-roading. Needs to kick butt in Baja.
1,@kimbal Karma is real
1,@westcoastbill Yeah; super messed up
1,These were based on direct requests from their ICU wards; with exact specifications of each unit provided before shipment
1,Partial list of hospitals to which Tesla sent ventilators https://t.co/sfI6yuUbrM
1,@mdornic @CNN Perhaps you are unaware that Twitter has a search function? The hospitals *themselves* acknowledged receipt of ventilators.
1,@engineers_feed Nice
1,@NatureNews Interesting
1,@ADMofLibertalia So true
1,@CNN @GavinNewsom Not to mention Medtronic; who makes the most advanced ventilators in the world; also affirming our help! https://t.co/UlBmRGPtuc
1,@Amro_Alzeiq @CNN @GavinNewsom I literally have the receipts!! This is so dumb. 🤣🤣
1,@CNN .@GavinNewsom please fix this misunderstanding
1,@alandail @paulasaywhatnow @CNN Exactly
1,@CNN What I find most surprising is that CNN still exists
1,“Dr. Levitan advocates combining breathing support from a CPAP machine or regular oxygen with comfortable positioning”. Yup.
1,“Don’t jump to intubation.” — Dr Caputo
1,@teslaownersSV @flcnhvy @dschless @Bob_Wachter A mask or nose “ventilator” with moderately increased oxygen % will help. This is common in hospitals. Intubation; where a tube is jammed down your throat under sedation &amp; you’re fed high pressure; pure oxygen for several days to weeks is questionable.
1,@flcnhvy @dschless @Bob_Wachter Sounds about right https://t.co/pEPVJi56Vg
1,@dschless @Bob_Wachter Roughly what is the survival rate of intubated patients? I’m hearing 10% to 20%. Is this overly pessimistic?
1,@TJShannon87 @Bob_Wachter I know of two nurses who had their job offers revoked; one in NYC and one in Arlington
1,@annerajb @samoanpunch @cromas @Bob_Wachter We’re working super hard on getting traffic lights &amp; stops released. Reverse summon (auto park) will be part of the core Autopilot software upgrade for FSD later this year.
1,@Bob_Wachter They were; but are they currently?
1,@samoanpunch @cromas @Bob_Wachter Interesting
1,@Bob_Wachter We are hearing almost all hospital ICUs have excess capacity. In some cases; 60% empty.
1,@RationalEtienne @PPathole @fat__tire @Kristennetten @Robotbeat @ghotiing @CruizVinicius @josh119872 @SweetINXS @voteLabonte @Erdayastronaut @Tesla Does seem that early use is wise. Solving late stage C19 probably requires two or three mechanisms of action.
1,@Erdayastronaut @BnOrdhaug @sivanithu @tobyliiiiiiiiii @cabral_psyd @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee @RocketLab @Peter_J_Beck Sure
1,@Erdayastronaut @sivanithu @tobyliiiiiiiiii @cabral_psyd @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee @RocketLab @Peter_J_Beck Production is by *far* the hard part. That’s why I’m not super worried about early Starship failures. Initial serial numbers are suboptimal; so would be lawn ornaments if they survived. That said; as lawn ornaments go; they’re pretty sweet …
1,@nextspaceflight @Erdayastronaut @sivanithu @tobyliiiiiiiiii @cabral_psyd @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee @RocketLab @Peter_J_Beck SN4 won’t get flaps; so can only do flights with engine on. Just did a reset this week on flap; actuator &amp; static aero design. Either SN5 or SN6 will get flaps.
1,@KeithMansfield @Erdayastronaut @sivanithu @tobyliiiiiiiiii @cabral_psyd @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee @RocketLab @Peter_J_Beck That’s for sure! 😅
1,@Erdayastronaut @sivanithu @tobyliiiiiiiiii @cabral_psyd @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee @RocketLab @Peter_J_Beck I have great respect for anyone who gets a rocket to orbit! It’s very hard. I’m spending crazy hours on Starship design/production. It is truly an honor to work with such great engineers. SN4 is almost done 😀
1,@PPathole @fat__tire @Kristennetten @Robotbeat @ghotiing @CruizVinicius @josh119872 @SweetINXS @voteLabonte @Erdayastronaut @Tesla My (again) personal favorite is https://t.co/rM1MqsVsr1
1,@sivanithu @tobyliiiiiiiiii @cabral_psyd @Erdayastronaut @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee @RocketLab Some of the small launcher activity is cool; especially @rocketlab. Downsides are helicopter retrieval doesn’t scale to bigger rockets &amp; is highly weather-dependent. Also; propulsive landing is needed for moon/Mars. That said; it’s probably right move for small LEO vehicle.
1,@fat__tire @Kristennetten @Robotbeat @ghotiing @CruizVinicius @josh119872 @SweetINXS @voteLabonte @Erdayastronaut @Tesla Vast majority of “ventilators” are not intratracheal; but; yes; jamming a pipe down a patient’s throat &amp; driving in high pressure; pure oxygen is definitely not how we evolved! My personal choice would be mask with moderate pressure at ~50% O2. https://t.co/pEPVJi56Vg
1,@cabral_psyd @sivanithu @Erdayastronaut @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee Merlin is arguably version 6 or 7 by now. It’s a real workhorse; but looks so simple next to Raptor!
1,@PPathole @Robotbeat @ghotiing @CruizVinicius @josh119872 @SweetINXS @voteLabonte @Erdayastronaut @Tesla The way things are looking right now; the world will soon be flooded with excess ventilators. Even NY is giving them away!
1,@Erdayastronaut @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee Fundamentally; Atlas is still dependent on Russia to launch
1,@Erdayastronaut @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee Yeah; Atlas main engine is Russian. Great engine; but not US. Also; their fairing is Swiss. I think interstage &amp; payload separation system also not US.
1,@Robotbeat @ghotiing @CruizVinicius @josh119872 @SweetINXS @voteLabonte @Erdayastronaut @Tesla Tesla actually sent out ResMed; Philips &amp; Medtronic units. Latter is fully intratracheal. My personal opinion is that some ICUs are jumping the gun on intubation &amp; setting PEEP &amp; O2 too high. High pressure; pure oxygen increases risk of lung damage. https://t.co/2IUnS5DPOg
1,@Erdayastronaut @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee Sorry; meant to say only US rocket. Atlas V is close; but not yet 100%.
1,@davidmholtom @Nu23ro @SciGuySpace Tesla *was* saved by an investment in May 2009 from Daimler; not govt. Without that Daimler support; Tesla would have died. Super appreciated!
1,@davidmholtom @Nu23ro @SciGuySpace Exactly. In mid 2009; Tesla received non-binding approval for loan program actually signed into law by Bush in late 2008. First actual disbursement was Q2 2010; long after BK danger passed. Loan was repaid early with interest. Taxpayers made money on it!!
1,@thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee Last I checked; over a million dollars less. Moreover; F9 is launching far more often &amp; is only rocket fully NASA-approved for launching astronauts; so that gap is increasing.
1,@SciGuySpace @Some1gee Also; it costs less $ to insure a Falcon 9 mission. That’s the acid test.
1,To be clear; Fremont &amp; Shanghai will also be upgraded over time; but it’s hard to retrofit these improvements to an operating paint shop
1,Initial production at Giga Berlin is Model Y
1,@brandonbernicky You will be able to wrap it in any color or pattern
1,@justpaulinelol There’s tough competition for that title; but we will give it our best shot!
1,Giga Berlin will have world’s most advanced paint shop; with more layers of stunning colors that subtly change with curvature
1,@thirdrowtesla This will happen
1,@PPathole @thirdrowtesla We stole that from cheetahs
1,@thirdrowtesla In case it’s not already obvious; our product plan is basically stolen from Spaceballs
1,@Sofiaan @thirdrowtesla There’s a lot to talk about just on the battery front; so; yeah; just that. I guess we could answer some powertrain questions in Q&amp;A.
1,@thirdrowtesla Just battery day; but it will be great. Plaid powertrain will be later this year.

1,@MartyTee2 @greentheonly @davidhooperr Correct
1,@thirdrowtesla Yes; this is a real problem. The science is not in doubt.
1,@flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla Particulate matter from automotive exhausts has a much more serious impact on health than most people realize
1,@katlinegrey @Zvezdichko @SciGuySpace @Rogozin In the future; it will be as strange to have expendable rockets as it would be to have expendable airplanes today. All will be reusable.
1,@Darkellysio @katlinegrey @Zvezdichko @SciGuySpace The swivel wing design was cool. This seems like a good idea: https://t.co/Aq81q9oMdq
1,@katlinegrey @Zvezdichko @SciGuySpace Strange; as SpaceX lands on land frequently. Russia has very talented engineers; but they must be given reusability as goal or success is impossible.
1,@cleantechnica A lot has happened in 8 years
1,@AbiyAhmedAli @Tesla Good talking to you too. It was an honor.
1,@SciGuySpace SpaceX rockets are 80% reusable; theirs are 0%. This is the actual problem.

1,Great differences in technology exist in the world about which even hardcore technologists are unaware
1,@ajtourville @thirdrowtesla Certainly no problem for a 144 trillion operations per second computer to make ~15 steering/acceleration/braking maneuvers per second. That’s a trillion calculations between each output command.

1,Anyone who claims that their political party does no wrong and the other party does no right is either a liar; a fool or both.
1,@Scobleizer Grok ftw
1,@WallStreetSilv Absolutely
1,@WallStreetSilv It is beyond parody at this point
1,@MarioNawfal Cool
1,@SwipeWright Kids are highly susceptible to suggestion; which is why they believe in Santa!
1,@Rothmus Must have been hot &amp; itchy wearing those wigs; but maybe better than having lice 🤷‍♂️
1,Wow; this is messed up.   Imposing guilt upon people for things that happened before they were even born is not right. It needs to stop.
1,@tsarnick How do we know we aren’t already there?
1,@ZubyMusic Nice to meet you too; sir!
1,@MikeBenzCyber At least this time; the people will know the truth
1,Another “conspiracy theory” turns out to be true.   Strange that Arizona requires proof of citizenship for state; but not federal elections 🤔
1,@Erdayastronaut @Teslaconomics @SpaceX We could build a lot more; but the next version of Raptor is really the one to scale up production. We begin testing it in McGregor within a week or so.   Regenerative cooling and secondary flow paths have been made integral to the whole engine; thus no heat shield is required.

1,Exactly.   A “class action” lawsuit; by definition; should represent the class; yet this one; and most others; do NOT; serving simply to enrich law firms at the expense of the people they falsely claim to represent.  The law should be changed to require at least 10% of the

1,@spacesudoer That was not the founding of SpaceX.  We were in Russia to negotiate buying some ICBMs and converting them to launch a philanthropic mission to Mars.   I later came to realize that the problem wasn’t the will to go to Mars – there is plenty of public interest – but rather that

1,@ModdedQuad @joerogan Noland and I discussed a possible second Neuralink (next gen version) that would allow his other brain hemisphere to interact telepathically with his computer.   This would be like having two-handed control ability; the equivalent of mouse and keyboard.
1,@levelsio Basically just a graphics card at scale 😂
1,@WholeMarsBlog Then HW5; which has been renamed to AI5; in the second half of next year.   The Tesla AI5 computer has ~10X the capability of HW4 computer and Tesla makes the whole software stack.
1,@WholeMarsBlog Mostly HW4; some Dojo
1,@markusdd5 @JeffTutorials Not as high as that; but still very high. The march of 9’s of reliability requires massive data and compute.
1,Sizing for ~130MW of power &amp; cooling this year; but will increase to &gt;500MW over next 18 months or so.   Aiming for about half Tesla AI hardware; half Nvidia/other.  Play to win or don’t play at all.

1,@natemcgrady Yeah!
1,𝕏 is by far the best way to reach the most influential people on Earth
1,@adampnathan @garrytan @agarwal @levie @sama @sbuss 1. The gross receipts tax needs to be revoked; as that makes it impossible for finance companies to be in SF.   2. Criminals must be incarcerated.  3. Opening selling of fentanyl &amp; crack on the streets must be prosecuted.   That’s what is needed.

1,@PezRadar Please fix the Druid class. After this patch; Druid went from doing 3% of Barb/Sorc damage to 1%!!  https://t.co/HGCYdZWG2s
1,Tesla Megapacks massively increase electric power generation efficiency; as they can buffer power at night for use in the day; dramatically reducing the need to build new powerplants.   It also allows for the least efficient power plants to be shut down!
1,The new Model 3 Long Range is an amazing car
1,@ZFellows_ True
1,@AdrianDittmann Yeah
1,Big improvements to advertising
1,@PezRadar Druid damage is 30 times lower than Barb or Sorc. Would be great to address this.
1,@Teslaconomics @WholeMarsBlog Rolls out to select areas in a few months.   Also; Mini can be a great low-cost option for a good backup Internet connection if your landline goes out.
1,@wsellers @WholeMarsBlog Yes; better ping than many cable Internet connections
1,@WholeMarsBlog About half the price of the standard dish to buy and monthly subscription; but you can still watch multiple 4k video streams simultaneously!  23ms latency. https://t.co/07bW5WgKKi

1,@Klaus_Arminius He already killed someone and wasn’t deported?
1,@Rothmus I tried telling people this!  When I talked to doctors in Wuhan after the first wave hit China; their top recommendation was to avoid using intubated ventilators for extended periods at 100% O2; as it damages the lungs.   https://t.co/ZA1NrOHcU9.  I got the “you’re not a doctor”

1,@cb_doge Maybe it’s just me; but I don’t think we should trust him with user data 🤷‍♂️
1,@WholeMarsBlog Yeah; the fundamental problem with relying on precise maps is that the world is constantly changing and even small errors can lead to terrible outcomes
1,@shivon Haha true

1,@tobi Elden Ring was incredible. Looking forward to the DLC.
1,@lexfridman Thanks Lex!
1,@KanekoaTheGreat @MarcoPolo501c3 Hunter’s private shenanigans are not a big deal; in my opinion. Live and let live.   However; damaging the integrity and credibility of the United States is unacceptable; as that dishonors the country.
1,@SpeakerJohnson Indeed; impugning the integrity of the United States is a far more serious matter.
1,@MarioNawfal Lmao nobody cares
1,@TeslaBoomerMama That’s cool
1,How to share links
1,@Culture_Crit Could be worse tbh
1,@SawyerMerritt It is tough sledding out there

1,@tobi @SaltandSundry Congrats!
1,@AutismCapital Based 😂
1,@SciGuySpace I think we can do it. Progress is accelerating.   Starship offers a path to far greater payload to the Moon than is currently anticipated in the Artemis program.   A permanently crewed Moon base is possible.
1,@cb_doge Great question
1,@Mekuna2897 Impressive build optimization!   Sadly; there is no hope for Druid.
1,@RepThomasMassie I agree. He (and others) should be in jail for impugning the integrity of the United States by taking bribes for political favors; but not for this pseudo-crime.
1,@0xgaut I do have to applaud Apple for their bravery in removing legacy ports
1,@cb_doge They cannot
1,@AutismCapital The truth is that handing your data over to digital superintelligence (that Apple themselves cannot even build or understand) at the operating system level is insane.
1,@SawyerMerritt Exactly
1,@Rainmaker1973 I’d buy one
1,@cstanley @XReedyy_ Yeah

1,@WallStreetSilv The only reason they’re still in power is because they postponed the election
1,@ByeonChansoo @markusdd5 I like the fighter-mage combo of Druid in Diablo; as it has the most complexity.   Which class is strongest varies by Diablo season and is often due to bugs in the battle mechanics.   Blizzard both nerfed the Druid main attack *and* fixed a bugs that led to the class dominating

1,@DimaZeniuk It will be stunning all the way to the Colorado River
1,@dogeofficialceo Yeah
1,@sampullara Then leave it as an app. This is bullshit.
1,Now imagine if an AI trained in this way grows in power immensely
1,@MKBHD Apple using the words “protect your privacy” while handing your data over to a third-party AI that they don’t understand and can’t themselves create is *not* protecting privacy at all!
1,@pronounced_kyle True
1,It’s patently absurd that Apple isn’t smart enough to make their own AI; yet is somehow capable of ensuring that OpenAI will protect your security &amp; privacy!  Apple has no clue what’s actually going on once they hand your data over to OpenAI. They’re selling you down the river.
1,@tim_cook Don’t want it.   Either stop this creepy spyware or all Apple devices will be banned from the premises of my companies.
1,And visitors will have to check their Apple devices at the door; where they will be stored in a Faraday cage
1,If Apple integrates OpenAI at the OS level; then Apple devices will be banned at my companies. That is an unacceptable security violation.

1,@GavinSBaker @Atreidesmgmt Much appreciated
1,@triggerpod @BriannaWu Interesting
1,@EndWokeness Just fully Mad Max
1,@ggreenwald What he does on his own time doesn’t affect the public; but he appears to have been involved in corrupting other countries. That deserves a thorough examination.

1,@fentasyl A significant portion of so-called “homeless people” in American cities are clearly not sane in any meaningful sense of the word.  The word “homeless” is a lie; as it implies that all they’re missing is housing; as if they just got a little behind on their mortgage payments.   An

1,@MarcusHouse Left flap also got very hot; but was less damaged.   Rear flaps seemed to be ok; based on their control authority; but probably lost some tiles.
1,@PeterSweden7 The “right-wing” agenda today is just the centrist agenda of 20 years ago. The left has become an extinctionist movement.

1,@EndWokeness Exactly
1,@tunguz But if we can’t even reach Uranus; how will we ever find a black hole 🥺
1,@micsolana That flag has become such an aesthetic nightmare!
1,@stclairashley This troubles me too. We should strive for more beautiful streets in our cities.
1,@cb_doge It comes down to what you think the ratio of humanoid robots to humans will be. My guess is that it will be &gt;&gt;1.
1,@BasedBeffJezos @X @Starlink @xai I will do my best
1,@EndWokeness Whoa
1,@Rothmus Yeah.   Our goal now is simply to adhere to the laws of the country of operation; but not to put our thumb on the scale.
1,My dream is to reach Uranus 💫
1,@GailAlfarATX Great summary!

1,@battleangelviv @Rob_2628 Yeah :) It sounds great!
1,@Rob_2628 Nice!  I will stream some Diablo later today.
1,@SeibtNaomi Why is there such a negative reaction from some about AfD?   They keep saying “far right”; but the policies of AfD that I’ve read about don’t sound extremist. Maybe I’m missing something.
1,@RodFergusson Wow; lot of players! Diablo is a hall-of-fame game.
1,@cb_doge What are the odds? 😂  And that I was born 69 days after 4/20!!
1,@CoffeewClassics Yeah
1,@WholeMarsBlog An accurate assessment
1,@Scobleizer Thanks :)
1,Thanks Ashok!   Ashok was the first person to join the Tesla AI/Autopilot team and ultimately rose to lead all AI/Autopilot software.   Without him and our awesome team; we would just be another car company looking for an autonomy supplier that doesn’t exist.   Btw; I never

1,Publish full-length; complex articles on 𝕏!
1,@OwenSparks_ Cool
1,Sorry it’s taken so long to make it happen; but we’re super close now
1,@AdrianDittmann Yes.   Just like the Falcon Heavy simulation; which looks almost exactly like the actual flight.
1,@CuriousPejjy No Model Y “refresh” is coming out this year.   I should note that Tesla continuously improves its cars; so even a car that is 6 months newer will be a little better.
1,@AdrianDittmann Next flight is the goal
1,@ajtourville True
1,@SawyerMerritt @technoking_420 A lot of shareholders are having challenges voting due to the institutions that hold their shares making it complicated; so any community support would be much appreciated!
1,@AlexJonesMW3 @X Working on it
1,@teslaownersSV I really do care
1,@wintonARK Far too much of the stock market is effectively controlled by ISS and Glass Lewis; who have zero economic alignment with actual shareholders!
1,@zerohedge Yeah; this is not cool.   If they actually surveyed their constituents; they would discover overwhelming support in favor.   So far; roughly 90% of retail shareholders who have voted have voted in favor of both resolutions. The public sentiment is unequivocally supportive.
1,I’ve mentioned something like this before; but; if any of my companies goes public; we will prioritize other longtime shareholders of my other companies; including Tesla.  Loyalty deserves loyalty.
1,@DJSnM We should make a new high Mach super sonic plane; but nothing comes close to beating rockets in their native environment of space (obviously)
1,@cb_doge It’s just not in the same technology league as the real-time collective consciousness that is 𝕏

1,@___frye Engineering is fun for me; whereas politics and posting on controversial issues feels like putting my hand on a hot stove – mega pain.   The reason I do the latter; admittedly ineptly at times; is because I think it is necessary to counteract corrosion of civilization.
1,Please take a moment to vote your Tesla shares before the annual meeting on Thursday.   Lmk in comments if you encounter any issues.
1,@PeterDiamandis Thanks Peter
1,@AlexBerenson Exactly
1,Ship it https://t.co/Kj5OTpmmK5
1,@yacineMTB Next flight; we try to catch it with giant Mechzilla arms; inspired; at least in part; inspired by Kong v Godzilla.   If they can fake do it in movies; we can do it irl! Logic.

1,Cool
1,@alex_avoigt Thanks Cathie
1,@Kristennetten We plan to move older Starships close to the fence; so people can take pics with them if they want
1,@Rainmaker1973 Not bad. They should clean up the details in the wedges. Looks messy in there.

1,@SawyerMerritt @UpfitTesla @UnpluggedTesla Cool
1,@stevenmarkryan Chanos is shady
1,Worth mentioning that switching to ultra hard; cold-rolled stainless steel for Starship is what led me to make Cybertruck out of it too
1,@InfographicTony @SpaceX Pretty accurate
1,If you want a detailed explanation of why I switched Starship from carbon fiber to stainless steel   https://t.co/pXC0ngheiw
1,@WholeMarsBlog Looking into it
1,@DavidSacks Thoughtful
1,Note; a newer version of Starship has the forward flaps shifted leeward. This will help improve reliability; ease of manufacturing and payload to orbit.

1,@CathieDWood Exactly
1,Thanks Cathie
1,@marenkahnert Yes.   I should note that we have since moved to a proprietary stainless steel alloy; developed internally; as 301 in plate form had interlaminar toughness issues at cryogenic temperatures.
1,@matteosalvinimi Thanks!

1,@JohnStossel ESG ratings are extremely distorted
1,@SawyerMerritt Cool
1,@RobertKennedyJr @TuckerCarlson Sachs is right
1,Accurate 😂
1,We did switch to a passive (mostly) glass heat shield; rather than actively-cooled steel; as the latter was heavier; at least according to initial calculations
1,Why is Starship made of stainless steel? This article from 5 years ago explains the reasons.  Worth noting that the ship would have failed on reentry if made of aluminum or carbon fiber; as they can’t take the heat.  https://t.co/QVAtv74quq
1,🚀🚀 Stainless Steel Rocket 🚀🚀
1,@krassenstein Speaks to the incredible resilience of stainless steel at temperature.   We will further hone our SX300 alloy to withstand even higher temperatures.
1,@Cmdr_Hadfield @SpaceX Thanks Chris!  A fully and immediately reusable orbital heat shield; which (as you know) has never been made before; is the single toughest problem remaining.  Being able to iterate with many ideas on many ships is key to solving this.
1,@jack attention is all you need
1,@Kristennetten @SpaceX I think we should try to catch the booster with the mechazilla arms next flight!
1,@cb_doge Yeah
1,Despite loss of many tiles and a damaged flap; Starship made it all the way to a soft landing in the ocean!  Congratulations @SpaceX team on an epic achievement!!

1,@Rob_2628 Nice.  Also; your feedback for improvement is spot-on.
1,Congratulations on a successful launch!
1,@Rothmus Usually true (sigh)
1,I’m glad the government of Japan recognizes the importance of this matter.  If radical action isn’t taken; Japan (and many other countries) will disappear!
1,@Rainmaker1973 There are worse ways to die
1,@ajtourville The existing factory space was already allocated to vehicle; battery and cell production.   And this is not a matter of tucking a few computers into a corner. You need a kW of power and cooling for each GPU; which would mean 12MW of power and 12MW of cooling.  The south extension

1,@ryan_fosnaugh @DrKnowItAll16 @SawyerMerritt Correct.   Also; I can’t overstate the difficulty of making 50k H100s train as a coherent system. No company on Earth has been able to achieve this yet.   Once we have that system working; we will order more hardware.
1,@WholeMarsBlog @rocker_261 @SawyerMerritt Training compute for Tesla is relatively small compared to inference compute; as the latter scales linearly with size of fleet.   Perhaps the best way to think about it is in terms of power consumption.   When the Tesla fleet reaches 100M vehicles; peak power consumption of AI
1,@SawyerMerritt Of the roughly $10B in AI-related expenditures I said Tesla would make this year; about half is internal; primarily the Tesla-designed AI inference computer and sensors present in all of our cars; plus Dojo.   For building the AI training superclusters; NVidia hardware is about

1,@MarioNawfal The GPS signal is very weak; so easy to jam
1,@Teslaconomics Starship already reached orbital velocity; which is success for all other rockets.   Achieving full reusability will be profound not for reasons of valuation; but because it will enable consciousness to extend permanently beyond Earth.
1,@EndWokeness Wow; this is unreal!

1,@IterIntellectus Exactly
1,Yeah
1,@buildingMadrid We don’t use patents; except to block patent trolls; so others are free to copy us.   SpaceX is building the technology to extend consciousness beyond Earth; so the cost per ton to orbit &amp; beyond must necessarily be low enough to accomplish that goal.

1,The goal of citizenship for all illegals is very clearly stated by the leader of the Senate.  For some reason; a lot of people still think this is some crazy conspiracy theory!   https://t.co/85jOl3Q0S1
1,@TrungTPhan Wow cool
1,@MarioNawfal It will become very cheap
1,@elon_docs Cool
1,@MikeBenzCyber @dbongino Interesting.   I’m not anti-CIA (my son’s middle name is a CIA project!); but I do think our State Dept policies &amp; execution could be better.
1,@MarioNawfal Being thin is just good for your health in general
1,@fentasyl More people get a four-year college degree than need one or use one
1,@TrungTPhan Oops 😅
1,Just a reminder that Earth is almost empty of humans; contrary to what many people think https://t.co/jdzbQsSWzd
1,@MarioNawfal Yeah; it’s a real risk
1,WhatsApp exports your user data every night.   Some people still think it is secure.
1,@MarioNawfal It’s happening almost everywhere
1,@DimaZeniuk That was a tough time
1,Great show!
1,@RidingFarNow @WholeMarsBlog Feels that way sometimes
1,@PeterDiamandis That sound too high; but your point is still valid
1,@MikeBenzCyber Wow; this is insane!
1,@AlexBerenson I’ve been raising this issue like a broken record for years
1,Improvements to Communities
1,@BasedMikeLee Progressives do sometimes believe this is happening to them; but it is more common to hear these concerns from conservatives.  As mentioned; our goal is to have a level playing field; so the public can hear both sides of an issue.
1,@xDaily Media Matters is a scam
1,@ChrisLoesch @BasedMikeLee That is weird
1,It’s a real thing that you can try today
1,@MarioNawfal Falcon and Dragon are the best in the world at what they do.   The SpaceX Starship is alien technology. Nothing like it has ever been attempted; as it is capable of lifting the entire pressurized volume of the International Space Station in a single flight and will do several
1,The Boring Company connects another hotel in Vegas!  Within a few years; you will be able to get to all major destinations in the city super fast with electric cars in tunnels.   No need to imagine; you can try it today between Resorts World and the Convention Center!
1,Tesla Megapack batteries are great for buffering energy at scale!
1,@BasedMikeLee Well; neither conservative nor progressives should be throttled. The point is to have an even playing field.   I will investigate.
1,@MarioNawfal True
1,@PeterDiamandis Especially on pizza
1,@GavinSBaker Exactly.   SpaceX is spending significant resources combating Russian jamming efforts. This is a tough problem.   They have succeeded in shutting down every communications system; except Starlink.
1,@MarioNawfal Babies are financially punitive to most families. Government should at least even the scales.
1,@cb_doge I will do another Spaces with @GadSaad hopefully next week when improved video spaces is released
1,@MaryTilesTexas @KettlebellDan Greatly improved video spaces will be released soon
1,@BillMelugin_ I’m in favor of greatly increasing our legal immigration; but hardcore stopping illegal immigration.   This guy will probably will actually work hard; but there should be a probationary period where working hard and good behavior are required to stay in America.
1,Could be a good one https://t.co/PZKM9sWz4m
1,@stclairashley Fear of ostracism
1,@MarioNawfal Other countries are not like America
1,@garrytan @zackmfc Those so-called activists are squares; conformists and corpo stooges posing as progressives.   The most rebellious thing you can be in San Francisco is a Republican.   🏴‍☠️
1,@InezFeltscher Scary
1,@WallStreetSilv Irreconcilable differences
1,OG Doge has ascended to heaven to be with his friend Harambe  (@Not_the_Bee)
1,@greg_price11 True
1,@MarioNawfal Ukraine will most likely decline; because NATO won’t let them stop the war yet.  That allows Putin to tell the Russian people that he offered peace and it was refused; so there is no choice but to ramp up the war.
1,@cb_doge Rest in peace
1,@libsoftiktok @ChrisWardCA That is absolute showstopper for me regarding California.
1,@MarioNawfal Yeah
1,@fentasyl They get taxpayer money?
1,@BillyM2k Something wacky is happening
1,@CraigChamberlin @libsoftiktok And they publicly gloated about getting people fired
1,@libsoftiktok That is exactly what happened
1,Flight 4 in about 10 days
1,@pmarca Self-awareness 🙌
1,@cb_doge Yeah
1,@libsoftiktok Karma is real
1,@jamesdouma True
1,@MarioNawfal SpaceX has no need for additional capital and will actually be buying back shares.  We do liquidity rounds for employees and investors every ~6 months.
1,@netcapgirl We will view humans driving cars in the future the same way we view human elevator operators today
1,@MarioNawfal 𝕏 has 600 million monthly active users; about half of which use the platform every day
1,@natfriedman 𝕏 + kids
1,@Caitlyn_Jenner Hear; hear! 😂
1,@VivaTech It really is
1,@AutismCapital Mostly
1,@Rob_2628 Druid is so feeble by comparison … sigh
1,@SpeakerJohnson Seriously
1,@SethDillon It causes very severe harm to innocent people
1,@RepThomasMassie Great!
1,@Jim_Jordan Indeed!
1,@EndWokeness The shows clear as day that the reason the Democrats have an open border policy is to import voters
1,Yeah!
1,@Not_the_Bee Is this actually possible?
1,@robbystarbuck The crowd knows :)
1,@lexfridman Yeah. Caffeine doesn’t affect me much; but I like the ceremony of it.
1,@America1stLegal Interesting
1,@JulienSalinasEN @grok Cool
1,@xDaily True 😂
1,@Rob_2628 Wow. Druid is so weak by comparison :(
1,A lot of social media is bad for kids; as there is extreme competition between social media AIs to maximize dopamine!
1,@stoobe @eyeslasho True
1,@cb_doge Yeah
1,@Rob_2628 Wow. Much tougher sledding with Druid!
1,Trust the collective wisdom of the people
1,@WhatsupFranks Much appreciated. They keep their word on a deal.
1,@DimaZeniuk Feels like a long time ago
1,@JohnStossel I think you mean Tesla?
1,People will die if doctors misdiagnose patients
1,@TheBabylonBee Seriously 😂
1,@cb_doge Meta is not secure
1,@EndWokeness That was what I saw when I visited the border
1,@elon_docs Thanks for the kind words
1,Activists should be removed as judges
1,@WholeMarsBlog Yeah
1,Asian women earn more than white men
1,@teslaownersSV Yeah
1,Is suspect this thought has gone through many men’s minds recently 😂😂
1,@elon_docs Almost ten years ago
1,@TheChiefNerd @megynkelly Not Bill Maher’s finest performance
1,@GailAlfarATX Those fools didn’t even play the game. I did.
1,@AdrianDittmann You can add mods; but we need to work on moving ownership (admin control)
1,@ID_AA_Carmack Yeah; I do the same
1,Community Notes now translated
1,Some people still believe the legacy media
1,@farzyness No; but PhDs in Marxism will
1,@cb_doge To be precise; it is number of drones produced per month times average kill ratio. Whichever side has the higher number wins.
1,Thanks Jensen! @nvidia
1,@AnOpenSecret Unconscionable!
1,@BillAckman This is demented
1,@TexasLindsay_ This is rather rare 😂
1,@alsamahi True; the computer won’t miss
1,@MarioNawfal We should limit future wars to drones. Humans will die very fast.
1,@cb_doge !!  Something weird happened with autocorrect today. I was writing the birthday of my sister and it automatically filled in the correct date …
1,@RobertKennedyJr @realDonaldTrump @POTUS True
1,Great work by the Notes team!
1,@TeslaHype @MarioNawfal Yeah
1,@BillMelugin_ This just keeps getting crazier
1,Interesting visit to @LosAlamosNatLab today. Discussed a lot of science 😉
1,This would be much appreciated!
1,@EndWokeness This is insane 🤯
1,@DefiantLs So much harder for the media (or anyone) to misrepresent the situation
1,@MarioNawfal Way better than individual human censors; who are far more susceptible to government or corporate corruption
1,@cb_doge True
1,@cb_doge Possible; but extremely difficult
1,@xanbarksdale Yeah; we’re fixing this so you can scroll back to see interesting posts
1,@teslaownersSV Awesome 😎
1,@SawyerMerritt Yeah
1,Launching @Starlink in Fiji with ⁦@PresidentFiji⁩! https://t.co/mOmf2HNkm9
1,@RobertKennedyJr Sure
1,@stillgray They are shamelessly copying stupid things from America. How embarrassing.
1,Teamwork can solve anything https://t.co/wy8yJuR4lg
1,@MuskUniversity Yeah
1,@MorningBrew Yeah; it’s obviously a ripoff. They were literally bragging about it.
1,@ChayaRaichik10 Ridiculous.   Does anyone actually watch MSNBC?
1,@WallStreetSilv Good for the coach!
1,@MKBHD Apple headphones are great. Anything better?
1,@JackPosobiec But I thought we were there to “uphold democracy”?
1,@RodFergusson Have you tried the Pit yet?
1,@cb_doge Yeah
1,@RickRieder Do you think the Fed should lower rates and that doing so would materially benefit lower income earners?  My understanding is that you do and I agree with that position.
1,@tunguz That chair is a hall-of-famer. Still few that compare.
1,@Chesschick01 The Fed has a crazy high number of employees
1,Easy to order online in 2 minutes at https://t.co/Q1VvqV5G0i. No long-term contract required.
1,@nypost Uhh … why?
1,@UpdatingOnRome That was one for the ages 😂
1,@PezRadar Without a mid-season update; it doesn’t look like any class (even Necro) can clear a 200 Pit.   Would be cool to bring back the Tears of Blood glyph or something that makes a 200 Pit possible.
1,@JamesEsses Cis is a slur. Shame on anyone using it!  Live by word-shaming; die by word-shaming. It is hypocritical of the pronoun fascists to demand having it both ways.
1,@teslaownersSV It really is
1,@dinkin_flickaa I turned off reader mode; because I hated seeing that button all the time. Maybe it should default on?
1,@krassenstein Synthetic mRNA has incredible potential for curing cancer! https://t.co/DerJFr0GQj
1,@CommishSmith Deeply concerning thread
1,@CommishSmith This seems incredibly improper
1,@uTobian Once again; Prosecute/Fauci
1,@Rothmus That might actually happen!
1,@libsoftiktok Hating on America is not cool
1,@cb_doge Disney is perhaps understandable; but why the others too
1,@BenjaminDEKR Black Mirror irl (again)
1,@JamesEsses Indeed
1,Testing Grok news funny mode  https://t.co/1LpjGGfT8l
1,@WorldAndScience Works for me
1,@WallStreetSilv He should stop copying us!
1,This is the quality of humor we want from Grok https://t.co/fLE9tARHlp
1,@netcapgirl Maybe it is time to move consumer desktops to Linux
1,@cb_doge Absolutely
1,This is a Black Mirror episode.   Definitely turning this “feature” off.
1,@cb_doge Dick move
1,Congratulations to the @SpaceX team on passing 3 million customers in 99 countries!  And thanks to you for buying @Starlink!
1,SpaceX might exceed 90% of all Earth payload to orbit later this year.   Once Starship is launching at high rate; probably &gt;99%. Has to be or we can’t build a city on Mars or base on moon.  We file almost no patents; so nothing stopping competition from copying us.
1,@farzyness Like; how much plastic?
1,@elon_docs The SpaceX Advanced Materials team has since developed a new metal alloy far better than 301
1,@ScottAdamsSays True
1,@tsarnick True
1,@PeterSweden7 Support the farmers!
1,But why does this boycott continue?
1,@RobertKennedyJr @thehill @CNN You should be in the debate
1,@PeterSweden7 For a country at high latitude; like Sweden; fission makes more sense than (indirect) fusion (aka solar).   Solar starts to make sense below 60 degrees latitude and is compelling around ~53 from the equator.
1,@esherifftv Cool
1,@ChayaRaichik10 True
1,In sharp contrast; 𝕏 supports child safety bills
1,The New Woke Times is truly unreadable https://t.co/QlWeZyFijc
1,@EFarraro It was so insane!
1,@EndWokeness The fundamental limbic drive to have children is extremely powerful or we wouldn’t be here today
1,Stream on 𝕏 https://t.co/USA6e0DVlO
1,@Rothmus It is getting crazy on twitch
1,@DanielleFong Never trust a cynic (wait; is that cynical?)
1,@TRHLofficial Could just do this in a car for free
1,@i_x_Sam @cb_doge Really?
1,@cb_doge I don’t read them; so no idea what they say unless it shows up here
1,@WallStreetSilv British candy is better. Actually; most countries have better candy than America.   Why *do* we have subpar candy?
1,@PeterSweden7 Wind turbines are fine if out of the way where they aren’t an eyesore. They are competitive when paired with batteries.  Nuclear fission is a no-brainer. We should have a lot more of it.
1,@alojoh @EvaFoxU Niche audience 😂
1,@TrungTPhan Too bad (sigh). I have some fond memories from a long time ago of eating at Red Lobster.
1,@EvaFoxU 🎶 You’re as cold as ice 🎶  (Actually; much colder. Ice is nothing.)
1,Starship Flight 4 in about 2 weeks.  Primary goal is getting through max reentry heating.   Worth noting that no one has ever succeeded in creating a fully reusable heat shield. Shuttle required &gt;6 months of rework.
1,@MattWalshShow Nonstop race-baiting!
1,@alx Maybe he hates eggplant 🍆
1,@SethDillon They start with that conclusion as 💯 likely and just fill in the reasoning afterwards
1,@netcapgirl Not me
1,@AlexFinnX Yes; this will significantly increase the reach of smaller accounts
1,@stillgray They didn’t get the memo
1,@netcapgirl Yeah!
1,@cb_doge Well; to be fair; the legacy media sometimes attack other “billionaires” 😂  But; yeah; it is weird. Maybe I just get a lot of clicks?   The legacy media is a click-maximizing machine; rather than a truth-maximizing machine.
1,@EndWokeness Please confirm @CommunityNotes
1,@teslaownersSV We plan to move the display rockets closer to the road
1,@RJarborg @Nordnet Thank you!
1,@dinkin_flickaa Why even have it?
1,@EndWokeness Bizarre tragedy
1,@WholeMarsBlog I love seeing the burgers being made
1,@cb_doge Yeah!!
1,The Tesla team put this together of their own volition (I did not ask for it). Thanks!
1,Thanks @AvanzaBank!
1,@SERobinsonJr @SawyerMerritt @NotATeslaApp Should be very rare after the 12.4 rollout. We have to sync up vehicle software (way too many hardware variants) with FSD.
1,@LibertyCappy @CommunityNotes Memory lends a rosy tint
1,@teslaownersSV The future should look like the future
1,@SciGuySpace We’re aiming to build two towers at the Cape for Staeship; one at 39A and another tbd (we don’t have final approval yet)
1,@GailAlfarATX Yeah
1,Starlink now available in 99 countries
1,@President_KR Looking forward to this
1,@lexfridman Excitement is guaranteed!  A good outcome for humanity is probable; but not certain.
1,@elon_docs Those are the key points
1,@tunguz And it will get a *lot* better as we move to a fully AI-based post recommendation system; order the replies (and remove spam/scam) with AI and enable full semantic search with AI
1,Reading the Grok newsfeed in fun mode is awesome 🙄
1,@ChayaRaichik10 Yet another “conspiracy theory” that turned out to be true
1,@ChayaRaichik10 Ye/; that was extremely troubling!
1,@MuskUniversity Mostly true. We’re fixing a few remaining situations where that isn’t true.
1,@TrungTPhan Interesting
1,@BasedBeffJezos That said; a desirable outcome is not certain
1,@MuskUniversity @SpaceX Very tough time
1,@SawyerMerritt And the roof will be fully covered by solar; except for the word “TESLA”; which will be gently outlined in light; so you can see it at night from airliners coming into Austin
1,@SawyerMerritt The rear portion of the factory extension (the part furthest away from the glass) will be a super dense; water-cooled supercomputer cluster
1,@Rothmus That is actually their chain of logic!
1,@sentdefender And we’re not even halfway through
1,@AISafetyMemes Yeah
1,@DimaZeniuk Yeah
1,@RW_UNP It was an honor to meet
1,@libsoftiktok Nancy Pelosi also recently claimed that the election was stolen at an Oxford debate with the banjo player from Mumford!  Truth is stranger and funnier than fiction 😂
1,@AdrianDittmann Same
1,Starlink is now available in Fiji! 🇫🇯
1,@salltweets Accurate
1,@natemcgrady @growing_daniel They do say that frequently in the game; but actually war changes a lot!
1,@growing_daniel Have you played Fallout 3?
1,Echoes of present day https://t.co/ZqNbKF3bN1

1,@AdrianDittmann I’ve had those
1,@libsoftiktok Never heard of her
1,@cb_doge Had a few minutes of glory and 8 years of neck pain
1,@Rob_2628 Seems like Necromancer is doing somewhere 10 and 1000 times more damage than other classes.   Not all classes have the same edge each season; of course; but this is the most unbalanced I’ve ever seen any game ever.
1,@MarioNawfal It will
1,@teslaownersSV Exactly
1,@elon_docs Almost a decade ago
1,@Rothmus Seriously 😂
1,Honored to launch @Starlink in Indonesia! https://t.co/cAHRxm3jvn
1,Starlink will help a lot of people throughout the world
1,@MarioNawfal This is catastrophic
1,@DimaZeniuk Good meeting
1,@MarioNawfal US taxpayers are funding 2/3 of NATO’s budget?  Seems very high.
1,@MarioNawfal There will be universal high income (not basic)
1,@stevenmarkryan True
1,Super low cost to charge your electric vehicle in Texas!
1,This is concerning. Tesla will reach out to these banks/brokers. Shareholders have the right to vote their shares!
1,@Austen Product development has actually sped up dramatically with fewer people
1,Stream your gameplay on 𝕏!  https://t.co/E8et5dq0xD
1,@AAC0519 @AP Yeah
1,@Molson_Hart Interesting
1,@wudijo Nice
1,True
1,@realJeremyCarl @MoreBirths @BirthGauge Great ad 😍
1,@LevineJonathan It’s almost like I understand how technology works 🤔
1,@KettlebellDan Yeah
1,@CuriousPejjy The Tesla naysayers are loud; but are rare outside of hedge fund short sellers and far left activists.   And; of course; our amazing President 😍
1,The Apple headphones are great
1,@alx Whoever controls the teleprompter is the real president
1,@DanielleFong People should dress in more interesting ways. The future should look like the future.
1,@Rob_2628 If the Pit difficulty increases with level like compound interest; then any class whose power doesn’t increase likewise will fall short at the end.  Would be good for all classes to have a shot at clearing Pit level 200.
1,@alx @jensstoltenberg Maybe he means “I da hobit” 🧌
1,@MikeBenzCyber Cracking open that Overton Window one meme at a time …
1,@tunguz I am an ambi-cringe-meme-lord
1,@stclairashley @JustinTrudeau How can one call it inclusive if any letter or number *isn’t* included!?
1,@jensstoltenberg Can you feel the cool breeze? That’s the Overton Window opening …
1,@jensstoltenberg More like #MisplacedPriorities https://t.co/5CwHUNi7xe
1,There are no coincidences https://t.co/QYD65DNNCp
1,@stillgray Yeah; they’re embarrassing themselves
1,@EdKrassen @X @grok That is what we’re aiming for with “Grok; analysis!”; but the product needs more work
1,Please let us know if you have any difficulties voting your Tesla stock
1,@Visionaledge Reminds me of a recent product demo 🤔
1,@DimaZeniuk Those are two different flavors; both great
1,@netcapgirl It will become so much more than it is today
1,@cb_doge Yeah
1,@tsarnick True
1,@stillgray Interesting
1,Grok upgrades.   Also; you will soon be able to see a humorous take on the news from Grok if you chose “Fun Mode”.
1,Extremely concerning
1,@cb_doge Yes. It will.
1,@john @KidRock @JellyRoll615 @cybertruck Cool
1,@EFarraro Yeah
1,Congrats Tesla Fremont team!
1,Please reply in comments if you’re having difficulty voting your Tesla shares
1,Great example of companies posting updates as 𝕏 Articles

1,@ElectionLegal @growing_daniel Choc chip cookie dough with Oreo  Salt caramel with peanut brittle in vanilla
1,@Chesschick01 @growing_daniel If cocaine actually helped with long-term productivity; I would definitely take it!  For any given drug; if you can complete the sentence “[blank] made me a better person”; then I think it should be legal.   I’ve never heard anyone say that about cocaine 🤔.
1,@growing_daniel When I was helping build the company; I didn’t even get ice cream 😢
1,@stillgray Mega brain pain
1,Yeah
1,@Not_the_Bee Sex “education” of any kind is inappropriate for young kids below age 10
1,@Not_the_Bee Allowing violent felons to target their community even when apprehended is terrible!
1,@libsoftiktok This is demented
1,Is this accurate? @CommunityNotes
1,@medicgordus @WholeMarsBlog That is somehow actually their rationale
1,@WholeMarsBlog Seriously
1,Sigh
1,@stclairashley Yeah!
1,I’m looking forward to this 😂
1,@venturetwins @udiomusic It’s only going to get better
1,Interview with Noland; world’s first recipient of a Neuralink; which enables telepathic control of a computer or phone just by thinking!  Long-term; I think we can bridge severed nerve signals to a 2nd Neuralink in the spine; restoring full body control.
1,Falcon going to orbit as seen from ocean https://t.co/Dclhju24ya

1,@DefiantLs It’s true – they super love sucking donkey dick. Don’t let you donkey near them!
1,@tblckn Not me; but probably a lot of people.   We should add this functionality.
1,@reddit_lies @OpenAI This kid sounds awesome
1,@OpenAI Bfd; Grok is partnering with 4Chan mfw
1,@SmallPettingZoo Funny how we do chores for hours in video games for fake gold 😂
1,Neuralink is accepting applications for the second participant.   This is our Telepathy cybernetic brain implant  that allows you to control your phone and computer just by thinking.  No one better than Noland (@ModdedQuad) himself to tell you about the first!

1,Grok will soon offer a humorous take on the news in the spirit of how The Daily Show and Colbert Report used to be in ancient times
1,@Timcast Has some decorative value
1,@eyeslasho Unfortunately; true.   An incentive for prisons to minimize recidivism would probably help significantly.   Today; the incentive is arguably for prisons to train prisoners to be lifelong criminals and keep returning to prison!
1,@DefiantLs Politics is indeed tribal; not logical
1,Stacking Starship https://t.co/FLAwrCI9Br
1,@cb_doge Yeah
1,@AlexFinnX @natemcgrady High priority fix
1,@WholeMarsBlog Yeah
1,@stclairashley @cb_doge Yeah

1,Interesting podcast!
1,@farzyness @MatchasmMatt We’re happy to sell it!
1,@Blake_Hall True
1,@MuskBreaking Yeah
1,@TexasLindsay_ Isn’t it ironic
1,@alx A debate outside the courthouse would be amazing 🤌
1,@cb_doge Less than 5 years for uncrewed;  less than 10 to land people; maybe a city in 20 years;  but for sure in 30; civilization secured.
1,@Not_the_Bee If only Zuckerberg were as tough (sigh). I’ve offered to fight him any place; any time; any rules; but all I hear is crickets. 🦗
1,Congrats @SpaceX Falcon team on 50 successful missions already this year!  Highest flight rate of any rocket ever.
1,@jeffskoll Thanks Jeff ♥️
1,@Kristennetten We care about beauty
1,Optimus will be amazing
1,@MatthewDR @WholeMarsBlog With 12.5
1,@WholeMarsBlog I don’t comment on everything; as sometimes I don’t see it and commenting on everything makes it easy to fish for information.   The take rate is much higher than 2%. Please.
1,@WholeMarsBlog Yeah; seeing it everywhere.  Btw; 12.4 goes to internal release this weekend and limited external beta next week. Roughly 5X to 10X improvement in miles per intervention vs 12.3.   12.5 will be out in late June. Will also see a major improvement in mpi and is single stack – no
1,@cb_doge He’s just missing his little phone
1,@stillgray Yeah; it kills the art
1,@0xgaut I think it’s a pretty cool idea
1,@farzyness China is awesome. Those who have not visited have no idea.   Compare high speed rail there and here.
1,@Jason @janleike I have to say that I rather admire the simple honesty of Jan’s statement
1,@reddit_lies Yeah
1,@The_Kyle_Mann @TheBabylonBee The Bee is an amazing predictor of the future!
1,@MorningBrew How times change
1,@0xgaut Looks like a midday DJ set at Burning Man.   Nothing wrong with that; of course; but the overall message is hard to interpret.
1,@Not_the_Bee Nobody’s perfect
1,@tunguz Hard to tell reality from parody
1,@tunguz Haha wow
1,@stclairashley The Guardian sucks donkey 🍆 🤣   Strong candidate for most misanthropic publication on Earth!
1,Cool
1,@Rob_2628 Must be coming in hot 🥵 😂!!  I suspect incremental patches will follow.
1,@TheRabbitHole84 They want a holocaust for humanity
1,Now imagine if the extinctionist philosophy is programmed into AI.   No need to imagine – this is already the case with Gemini and ChatGPT.
1,The true battle is:  Extinctionists who want a holocaust for all of humanity.   — Versus —  Expansionists who want to reach the stars and Understand the Universe.
1,@doc_gero This is tragic indeed. Virtue signaling at the expense of children is terrible.
1,@Teslaconomics Yeah
1,@SethDillon Well; @Reuters is known to be the absolute dumbest news organization
1,@alex_avoigt Contrary to what he thinks; that mandate; if it remains; will save BMW. All transport will be electric; with the ironic exception of rockets.
1,@cyantist Yeah
1,@krassenstein Thanks
1,@RealXHabib @imPenny2x Yeah; but sounding maybe like Rick from Rick &amp; Morty mixed with a based robot like Bender
1,@imPenny2x Something off about the voice and intonation. Reminded me of Scarlett’s Under Your Skin movie. https://t.co/hrFpIBmpnp

1,@TheRabbitHole84 Yeah; that was very troubling!
1,@stclairashley @StephenM Terrible
1,@MikeBenzCyber @nataliegwinters Global censorship network?
1,@SmokeAwayyy And not at this ridiculously slow bit rate
1,@netcapgirl It’s the proxy server IP addresses of your AI gf that really stab you through the heart 😢
1,@unlimited_ls Inevitable 😂
1,Truth is stranger &amp; funnier than fiction 😂
1,@MuskBreaking Actually; I’m switching context roughly every 5 mins on average and sometimes every 30 secs if going through texts/email.   A full hour on a single subject would be a long time.
1,@astro_greek True
1,@MikeBenzCyber The more unfair the attacks on Trump seem to the public; the higher he will rise in the polls
1,@karpathy That’s a better way to say it
1,@netcapgirl Deep
1,SpaceX’s mission is to extend consciousness to Mars and then the stars
1,This sounds bad
1,@MikeBenzCyber The betting odds on a Trump victory currently show a much tighter race
1,@DavidSHolz Yeah; better evals needed
1,@ElonMusksxAI @shaunmmaguire 🔔 was great; but others were close on his heels.  As for brushing up; I have tried to read about every significant battle in history; as well as every book on strategy or tactics since I was a child.
1,@shaunmmaguire Future wars will be drone wars.   Any given battle roughly comes down to kill ratio times number of units; assuming both sides have roughly similar unit counts.  This means that winning on kill ratio is irrelevant if the opponent has a much larger unit production advantage. This
1,@SawyerMerritt @theinformation It would also obviously be ridiculous for the Roadster to achieve simply the same 0-60mph time as Model S; even though it is a 2 door fully performance-oriented vehicle
1,@SawyerMerritt @theinformation The [Wrong] Information
1,@TheRabbitHole84 Critical thinking inhibits indoctrination and schools have become indoctrination centers
1,@BillyM2k That’s a big chicken!
1,@BillAckman @TIME @realDonaldTrump True; to @TIME’s credit; they do post the whole thing.  Part of the problem is the peer enforcement of left-wing views among editors/journalists.   Unless you push a left-wing viewpoint; you will be shunned by others of the Fourth Estate.
1,@WallStreetSilv 1990s and 2000s were great too
1,@australian Not trying to win anything. I just don’t think we should be suppressing Australian’s rights to free speech.
1,@stclairashley Sounds low
1,@stclairashley Noted
1,@BasedMikeLee Does seem odd …
1,@stclairashley @Cernovich @alx Interesting
1,@AdamSinger Easier to build a base on the moon than high speed rail in California
1,@BillyM2k I have to say that if he did use Stockfish butt vibes; he deserved to win. At least once.   Computers are so much better than humans at chess; it’s absurd.   I predict that chess will be essentially fully solved (like checkers) within 10 years.
1,@SethDillon I only have lil X every other week; so I try to spend as much time as possible with him
1,@a3voices @WholeMarsBlog Yeah
1,🥰 Happy Mother’s Day 🥰
1,@KevinCastley @MarioNawfal At this rate; it will become a cocktail snack on a toothpick!
1,@Supreme_Owl_FTW @paulg @jonatanpallesen True in many ways. Besides being a stimulant; percolation of coffee led to some of the ideas behind the steam engine.
1,@paulg @jonatanpallesen The critical factor was the commercial steam engine; as usable energy per human was no longer limited by what people and animals could eat.  The ability to reliably burn coal at scale to move things was an Earth-shattering breakthrough.  https://t.co/cNaut6NZ03

1,@TheRabbitHole84 True
1,@Thomasslabbers Yeah; we are a terrible at claiming credit and Meta is super greedy at claiming credit.   There is a major class action lawsuit against Meta for their false claims.
1,@eyeslasho True

1,@WholeMarsBlog I wonder who their puppet masters are?
1,@goth600 SpaceX satellites are feeling this solar storm. It’s big.
1,@twrobinette Now; apply this logic to Tesla

1,I doubt that the people of Australia agree with suppressing their rights
1,@esherifftv Something strange is going on

1,Concerning
1,@Liv_Boeree Weird
1,@WR4NYGov Something super weird is going on; as Tesla was the *only* car company attacked!
1,@Not_the_Bee Any idea who is orchestrating and funding this?
1,@Liv_Boeree Something fishy about this. They be *that* dumb!
1,@shaunmmaguire RIP indeed. Wow; can’t believe he’s gone.
1,@cstanley All update should include details of what improved

1,@Mayhem4Markets You are a liar.   There was no emerald mine and I have inherited nothing.
1,@DrEliDavid I know many who have changed their mind
1,This is accurate
1,@MKBHD Yeah
1,@GOPoversight Because the Democratic Party is counting on illegal immigrants to win
1,@thejefflutz @Tesla This is fake news.   Protesters did not manage to break through the fenceline. There are still 2 intact fence lines all around.   Note; this is “National Protest Week” in Germany; so there are a lot of protests for many different reasons.
1,@WallStreetSilv @nickshirleyy They seem dumb
1,Just started a Supercharger Community  https://t.co/o5QSGCfrp3
1,@sindenekoninaru @tokyoeveryday @inc_heavensgate @kabuki_bungaku Thanks; this is helpful feedback
1,Our 75th launch from Vandenberg; California
1,Just to reiterate: Tesla will spend well over $500M expanding our Supercharger network to create thousands of NEW chargers this year.   That’s just on new sites and expansions; not counting operations costs; which are much higher.

1,@NikoWrex @Rob_2628 @Raxxanterax Ok wow; then definitely impossible unless something is added mid season
1,@Rob_2628 @Raxxanterax Tier 25 AoZ was the hardest game I ever played! Was great playing with you; Ace and others.   Is there an equivalent to the Tears of Blood glyph in Season 4? Without that; T25 would have been absolutely impossible.
1,@EduardoLeite_ You’re most welcome
1,Given the terrible flooding in Rio Grande do Sul; @Starlink will donate 1000 terminals to emergency responders and make usage for all terminals in the region free until the region has recovered.  I hope the best for the people of Brazil. https://t.co/NK6kjz7Iag

1,@libsoftiktok Terrible
1,@Noahpinion How does one avoid brain worms?
1,@WholeMarsBlog FSD is a very hard problem
1,This is real https://t.co/0VERdNzUPB
1,@stevenmarkryan Out of ~100M votes; there will be at least a tiny amount of fraud. Anyone who claims there is none is obviously lying.
1,@stevenmarkryan Widespread voting by mail (not allowed before the scamdemic) makes proving fraud almost impossible
1,@MarioNawfal “Just a coincidence”
1,@WholeMarsBlog We must focus on FSD for the other 99% of the fleet.   Cybertruck FSD is a few months away.
1,@FoxNews Given the massive influx of illegals from every country on Earth; 2024 will probably be the last election actually decided by US citizens
1,@FoxNews The Democratic Party goal is to disenfranchise US citizens by importing as many illegal immigrants as possible
1,@FoxNews Unanimous Democrat opposition to requiring citizenship for apportionment of House seats and Presidential electoral college votes says it all
1,@JHartley2 @HighyieldHarry @jack That would legit be great!

1,@tunguz Mike Judge ftw
1,@shellenberger I wonder who fed them those lines
1,@shellenberger Concerning
1,@farzyness 12.4 has almost completely retrained models. The final touches are for comfort; as it sometimes accelerates or brakes too fast for most people’s taste.  12.5 and 12.6 are in various stages of testing. We’re getting into rare; complex situations; for example: going down a narrow;
1,@GadSaad Exactly
1,@westcoastbill Probably start rolling out 12.4 next week
1,@HeinrichKuttler @ibab @xai Welcome
1,@cb_doge Like; actually!!
1,@erikbryn As Tesla predicted 20 years ago
1,@MuskBreaking And we did
1,@alojoh Is he trying to compete with Cramer?
1,@cb_doge Kinda true; although I still like action movies
1,A terrible attack on the rights of Canadians to speak freely!
1,@Jim_Jordan @Weaponization Absolutely
1,@WholeMarsBlog We don’t need them even for that anymore
1,@Not_the_Bee I generally believe in vaccines; but anything should be subject to debate
1,@TheInsiderPaper No kidding
1,The latest version of Tesla’s (supervised) self-driving will blow your mind
1,@cb_doge Yup; with @adeoressi
1,@BillAckman Stan is wise indeed
1,@farzyness Grok does a great job of that 😂
1,@Erdayastronaut @rfa_space @isaraerospace Super important for them to focus on reusability
1,@FredLohner Thanks to everyone at 𝕏 working on this. Super important.
1,@realGeorgeHotz The true battle is; and always has been; between the expansionists and the extinctionists.   Don’t forget to have kids.

1,Why it is so important for @xAI’s @Grok to succeed. This is a much bigger deal than it may seem.
1,@jack Yup; concerning
1,@cb_doge Exactly
1,@stclairashley @TheOmniLiberal Cool
1,@eyeslasho Not fair
1,@EndWokeness This is insane
1,@SmokeAwayyy Algorithm update
1,@Rothmus Freud must have slept with a *lot* of women in Vienna
1,Accurate analysis.   Only about 1/10;000 of distance driven is useful for training.   The limiting factor for FSD progress was AI training compute; but now it is validation; as the interventions are so rare.

1,@MarioNawfal Yeah
1,@unlimited_ls 52 arrests?
1,@thackerpd Yeah
1,No humans; no humanity
1,@cb_doge All of human history is just a tiny blip in time so far
1,@drefanzor @stillgray That would be funny. Amazing in every way; but has the hands of a powerlifter! 😂  If someone is very attractive; their feedback loop to reality is affected. If they’re good-looking from a young age; they don’t even realize this is possible.
1,@cb_doge Yeah

1,@RepThomasMassie Interesting thread
1,Are you saying the fine was for repeating accurate government statistics?   Was there anything inaccurate in what she said?
1,@eyeslasho Whoa!!

1,Although Boeing got $4.2 billion to develop an astronaut capsule and SpaceX only got $2.6 billion; SpaceX finished 4 years sooner.   Note; the crew capsule design of Dragon 2 has almost nothing in common with Dragon 1.   Too many non-technical managers at Boeing.

1,@EZebroni @SawyerMerritt We have to pay the bills somehow
1,@SawyerMerritt The “260 mile” range Model Y’s built over the past several months actually have more range that can be unlocked for $1500 to $2000 (gains 40 to 60 miles of range); depending on which battery cells you have.   Working through regulatory approvals to enable this. https://t.co/6d5Ntekk01
1,@nursedanakay Pure AI vision auto park.   Coming soon; your Tesla will take you to your destination and park automatically; unless you ask it otherwise.

1,@unlimited_ls Not good
1,@unlimited_ls This is insane
1,@tsarnick Not far wrong for engineering orgs
1,@Rothmus Values vary widely
1,@WesternLensman @SRuhle Well; Trump was actually already president for 4 years and his policies bore no resemblance to those of Hitler; so this makes no sense.  In fact; with the Abraham Accords; he made some progress towards peace in the Middle East; which was definitely not high on Hitler’s agenda.
1,@stillgray Wow; this is messed up
1,@MarioNawfal Competition among schools will do more for helping kids education than anything
1,@EdKrassen Well; something’s gotta give.   We should at least slow down the debt growth.
1,@SmokeAwayyy I think the ratio will be at least 2 for every human; maybe 3 or 4; as there will be many in industry producing goods &amp; services; often for other robots in the supply chain
1,@stevenmackeyman Ok maybe I should work out
1,@esherifftv @SciGuySpace Starship will enable a permanently occupied moon base
1,@MarioNawfal We need to do something about our national debt or the dollar will be worth nothing
1,@shaunmmaguire Cool
1,Exactly
1,@fentasyl $50B per year!
1,@engineers_feed SpaceX has the most efficient argon ion thruster ever made at 69%. No kidding. Not 68; not 70; actually 69 😂.
1,This bill might have the opposite effect of its objective
1,@ZubyMusic Pinning posts should solve that problem. We could increase the frequency from 48h to 24h.
1,@randomfrankp @MKBHD Same

1,@SethDillon Exactly
1,@stclairashley @goyabeangroyper @ChristFuturistZ @DefiantLs @NickJFuentes Fate loves irony; but hates hypocrisy.  I cannot claim to be a defender of free speech; but then permanently ban someone who hasn’t violated the law; no matter how much I disagree with what they say.  This will probably cause us to lose a lot of advertisers and makes me sad; but

1,@flcnhvy Indeed. Both Cook &amp; I have been clear publicly that we have never spoken or otherwise communicated. I tried to speak to him &amp; he declined.   Nor have I ever expressed any interest in running Apple to anyone. Cook is; all things considered; obviously doing an incredible job.
1,@AdrianoinJapan @PolarStarRose He does like to play with my phone. There are many confusing videos he has taken.
1,@PolarStarRose Sorry; accidental tap!
1,@JeffTutorials @WholeMarsBlog That’s arguably a security issue; but  allowing companies to use other payment options; especially for in-app purchases would be fair.  As soon as they allowed that; they would have to lower their fees.  As for the cost of reviewing apps for security; a fixed fee makes sense.
1,@WholeMarsBlog Normally; competitive pressure would force Apple to lower fees; but Apple &amp; Android have a duopoly on phones. When interface familiarity is taken into account; it’s basically a monopoly.   The effective 30% sales tax Apple charges is hidden from users or there would be an outcry.
1,@RenataKonkoly @WholeMarsBlog Top feature request for sure
1,@WholeMarsBlog Actually; I like &amp; use Apple products.   They are just obviously overcharging with App Store. I mean 30% fees for doing almost zero incremental work is completely unreasonable.   Epic wouldn’t bother processing their own payments if App Store fees were fair.
1,Apple app store fees are a de facto global tax on the Internet. Epic is right.
1,@JamesClayton5 @markgurman @tim_cook Cook &amp; I have never spoken or written to each other ever.   There was a point where I requested to meet with Cook to talk about Apple buying Tesla.

1,Population collapse is potentially the greatest risk to the future of civilization https://t.co/VVN8kElTlS
1,@skorusARK Cars today are far more complex than Model T; with a global supply chain that is vulnerable to force majeure risk.   Like Model T; supply chain for battery EVs simply doesn’t exist at massive scale; so must be built in parallel.  Ideas are easy; production is hard.
1,@Gfilche Ships are probably fine with iron cells; but aircraft need very high energy density for good range.   I’m not saying Tesla will do aircraft – we have our hands full with cars &amp; solar/battery power generation – just that max energy density is needed for aircraft.

1,@NASASpaceflight @BocaChicaGal Sure
1,@Adamklotz_ @PPathole Good idea. They are not easy to move over roads; which is why the factory is close to the launch site; but we will support a museum that wants a prototype if they take care of transport.
1,@PPathole Most people have no idea Starship exists or how large this beast is!  Body diameter (9m or 30 ft) is bigger than a 747 or A380. Starship thrust &amp; mass are more than double Saturn V moon rocket.  Making life multiplanetary means massive rockets. Got to be done.
1,@NASASpaceflight @BocaChicaGal More of a pathfinder test. Actual payload bay door dimensions are still under debate. Volume is ~1000 cubic meters. Roomy …

1,@therationalroot Seriously; negative nominal interest rates!? What is the world coming to …
1,@DELTA_V But; much more important; is that this *design* is capable of full &amp; rapid reusability.   Long way to go from design to making it actually fully &amp; rapidly reusable with high payload; but at least success is *one* of the possible outcomes haha.
1,@Model3Owners Dry electrode is a key piece (one of many pieces) of the puzzle for lowering cost of lithium batteries.   That said; it has required an *immense* amount of engineering to take Maxwell’s proof-of-concept to high-quality; volume production &amp; we’re still not quite done.
1,@Model3Owners Ironic indeed; as I was at one point going to do my PhD at Stanford on high energy density capacitors for use in electric vehicles.   But lithium-ion has it covered. Even with no advances in lithium-ion technology; it’s possible to transition Earth to sustainable energy.

1,@enn_nafnlaus @jpr007 @TesLatino @klwtts Indeed; but again like a parking lot; a battery having big “roads” tends to decrease number of “parking spaces” (ie stores less energy)

1,@FrenchieEAP @karpathy FSD beta 9 is using the pure vision production code for highway driving. Beta 10 hopefully (Beta 11 definitely) will use one stack to rule them all – city streets; highway &amp; complex parking lots.
1,@Erdayastronaut @Model3Owners How about a wifi camera link?
1,@BLKMDL3 @Model3Owners In end; we kept production design almost exactly same as show car. Just some small tweaks here &amp; there to make it slightly better.  No door handles. Car recognizes you &amp; opens door.  Having all four wheels steer is amazing for nimble handling &amp; tight turns!
1,@johnkrausphotos @SpaceX @PortCanaveral Version 3 of the SpaceX droneship. Team did great work! Will be epic to see the deep sea oil rigs converted to ocean spaceports for Starship.
1,@Model3Owners To be frank; there is always some chance that Cybertruck will flop; because it is so unlike anything else.   I don’t care. I love it so much even if others don’t.   Other trucks look like copies of the same thing; but Cybertruck looks like it was made by aliens from the future.
1,@TesLatino @klwtts @jpr007 Tapering down charge rate is simply a physical thing that has to happen; as lithium ions bounce around what is an increasingly full “parking lot”.   Just like a car parking lot; where it takes longer to find a spot when the lot is almost full.
1,@jpr007 Not bad; although new Model S has more range &amp; faster charging. 3 &amp; Y should use long range version; as Performance version is meant for max speed &amp; handling; not max range.   Supercharger network is being upgraded to 250kW to 300kW; so that will help too.

1,@JxckSweeney @jack Good point
1,@ajtourville @PPathole @Adamklotz_ @AaronS5_ @crheller @SpaceX If we can do this successfully; then anything developed for ground/undersea fiber is automatically better in orbit
1,@ajtourville @PPathole @Adamklotz_ @AaronS5_ @crheller @SpaceX Similar to fiber optic. We are trying to ride the terrestrial fiber optic laser technology forcing function; but modified for use in vacuum.
1,@PPathole Yeah
1,@PPathole @Adamklotz_ @AaronS5_ @crheller @SpaceX Laser links in orbit can reduce long-distance latency by as much as 50%; due to higher speed of light in vacuum &amp; shorter path than undersea fiber
1,@Adamklotz_ @AaronS5_ @crheller @SpaceX More ground stations &amp; less foolish packet routing will make the biggest differences.  Looking at speed of light as ~300km per millisecond &amp; satellite altitude of ~550km; average photon round-trip time is only ~10ms; so a lot of silly things have to happen to drive ping &gt;20ms.
1,@jack 🙏   A new laughing emoji on DMs would be great
1,@crheller @SpaceX Glad it’s working! The sheer amount of work done by SpaceX engineering; production &amp; launch teams is amazing.   Ping should improve dramatically in coming months. We’re aiming for &lt;20ms. Basically; you should be able to play competitive FPS games through Starlink.

1,@austinbarnard45 Thanks Austin :)
1,@GokuAurelius @Erdayastronaut Roughly 800 to 1000 per year. That’s about what’s needed over ten years to create the fleet to build a self-sustaining city on Mars. City itself probably takes roughly 20 years; so hopefully it is built by ~2050.
1,@Erdayastronaut McGregor
1,@Erdayastronaut By “volume production”; I mean 2 to 4 engines per day. That’s super high volume for big rocket engines; but low volume by automotive standards.

1,@teslaownersSV Beta 9 will start uploading at midnight California time on Friday. Bear in mind; it is still just a beta!
1,@JeffTutorials @agokimpian @Vancity_Tesla @WholeMarsBlog @teslaownersSV Depends on how the limited beta goes. If it goes well; maybe a month or so.
1,@agokimpian @Vancity_Tesla @WholeMarsBlog @teslaownersSV Improved FSD screen. Attempting to show the “mind” of the car.
1,@WholeMarsBlog @teslaownersSV Saturday
1,@teslaownersSV Releasing Beta V9 end of week

1,I love this 🤣🤣
1,@EZebroni @Tesla Expect rapid improvement with pure vision
1,@Tesmanian_com Nikola Tesla was born in Croatia (to Serbian parents)!
1,@TeslaOwnersDE And by 2060; Tesla production will exceed the mass of the Universe!
1,@ChrisG_NSF @DJSnM Yeah; that would be cool. Also; using ship itself as structure for new giant telescope that’s &gt;10X Hubble resolution. Was talking to Saul Perlmutter (who’s awesome) &amp; he suggested wanting to do that.
1,Supersonic shock wave
1,@DJSnM We could stretch the Falcon Heavy upper stage &amp; increase this a lot; but FH already covers all known payloads.  Starship; especially with orbital refilling &amp; dedicated deep space variants (no heatshield; flaps or header tanks) will take this up orders of magnitude.
1,@PPathole @SpaceX Absolutely! Staggeringly insane amount of work between now and then.
1,High res landing Falcon landing video https://t.co/8CPuH87JYv
1,@jeff_foust Accurate. Show that Falcon Heavy addresses all use cases.
1,@weddleandsons @Tesla Working with Weddle and Sons Roofing has been a great collaboration for accelerating Tesla Solar Roof installation!   This is a lot of work; as tens of millions of homes need solar roofs! If you are a roofing company; please consider adding Solar Roof to your offerings.

1,@DavidNagySFgang Booster engines are not shrouded by skirt extension; as with ship. Engines extend about 3m below booster.
1,@SmileSimplify @thejackbeyer @MarcusHouse @artzius It’s one possibility
1,@RenataKonkoly @thejackbeyer @MarcusHouse @artzius Kinda has to happen :)
1,@thejackbeyer @MarcusHouse @artzius Center engines on ship will be same as booster engines. This is basically Raptor 2.  Raptor Vacuum would be only variant. Tbd as to whether to commonize R-Vac with Raptor 2 (more thrust); keep same or tighten throat (more Isp).   Adding 3 more R-Vac to ship with max Isp maybe …
1,@MarcusHouse @artzius All Raptors on booster; whether fixed or gimbaling; would be the same. 33*230 gets ~7600 tons of thrust &amp; T/W of ~1.5.
1,@Astro_Elliott @MarcusHouse @artzius Looking good at ~378 sec. Continued improvement will get it over 380.
1,Happy 4th to all!
1,Bless America https://t.co/QNagk4PArb

1,@RationalEtienne There is a big difference between reaching space and reaching orbit
1,@Model3Owners @Tesla Friday afternoons are usually Tesla design studio time. Cybertruck will be almost exactly what was shown. We’re adding rear wheel steering; so it can do tight turns &amp; maneuver with high agility.  Lot of other great things coming.

1,@RenataKonkoly @thesheetztweetz @rookisaacman @johnkrausphotos @wapodavenport @blueorigin But can I pay in Doge?
1,@AngelNDevil2 @torybruno But I guess I should take my own advice &amp; just work on saving the things I love
1,@AngelNDevil2 @torybruno What is not well understood is that ULA *still* has a monopoly carve-out for US government launches for which SpaceX is not allowed to compete; costing the taxpayer twice as much per launch than it should. This is obviously not real competition.
1,@torybruno Your company said the exact opposite in 2014 when it got a sole-source; uncompeted $11B DoD launch contract. https://t.co/Abd5sWhZDt  In any event; expendable rockets are as relevant to the future as expendable aircraft. Rapidly reusable rockets are all that matter.
1,@thesheetztweetz Will look pretty wild with a ship on top
1,Super Heavy on road &amp; 7th Tower segment added https://t.co/SJIHA3BLhL
1,@Astro_Elliott @LifeboatHQ Once you have rapidly reusable rockets of sufficient size to carry &gt;100 tons of payload; it is not clear that cost per ton to orbit/moon/Mars improves with a larger rocket.   Aircraft; for example; have moved away from 747/A380 to 777; which has ~100 tons of payload.
1,@_TomCross_ Million tons to Mars requires R R R
1,Super Heavy moves tomorrow https://t.co/qHG1SYO46S
1,@LifeboatHQ Doubling diameter increases mass 4X; but difficulty of simultaneously building &amp; launching rocket of that size is &gt;&gt;4X.   In retrospect; &lt;9m diameter for Starship might have been wise. Current size is ~5200 ton stack mass &amp; ~7500 ton-F thrust; which is more than double Saturn V.

1,@michilumin Sorry for any confusion. Dojo is a neural network training computer optimized for video (for self-driving).   Unless there is a predictable pattern to hashing Scrypt (which we will not attempt to find); it will not be competitive with ASIC-based hashing.   Potatoes are delicious!

1,@XHNews The economic prosperity that China has achieved is truly amazing; especially in infrastructure! I encourage people to visit and see for themselves.
1,@Erdayastronaut Impressive
1,@torybruno @ChadBowman0 @thesheetztweetz Now; this sort of nonsense happens all the time with government contracts &amp; everyone knows it.   However; in this case; it is money diverted from making life multiplanetary; which is the goal of SpaceX; vs the ULA goal of maximizing dividends to Lockheed &amp; Boeing.  Not ok.
1,@torybruno @ChadBowman0 @thesheetztweetz ULA would be dead as a doornail without the two launch provider DoD requirement.   If this is not true; then you won’t have a problem removing it.  Your parent company; Lockheed; darkened the skies with lobbyists to ensure F-35 was single source.   Seems a little inconsistent …
1,@WholeMarsBlog Yeah
1,@thesheetztweetz Work needed between flights is less &amp; less; as shown by shortening time between reflights. Required work between flights for Starship &amp; Super Heavy is zero.
1,@EZebroni @WholeMarsBlog You should notice several other improvements
1,Rapidly Reusable Rockets; R R R 🏴‍☠️
1,@Erdayastronaut We’ve already done a lot of iteration on ship. For rapid reusability; booster must return to launchpad; so inert mass impacts ascent; boostback &amp; landing burns. Triple whammy. Also; booster flight rate is ~5X that of ship; so multiple mass $ cost by 5.
1,@RenataKonkoly @Erdayastronaut First one to fly will; so Booster 4. Booster 3 will be used for ground tests. We’re changing much of design from 3 to 4. Booster 3 was very hard to build. Expect especially rapid evolution in first ~10 boosters &amp; first ~30 ships.
1,@Erdayastronaut Great shot! Btw; Starship Super Heavy will not have an entry burn. Delta-v is shifted more to the ship; so booster entry Q &amp; heating is lower.
1,@PPathole @Tesla @SpaceX Basic MRI is easier than it sounds good tbh. High resolution MRI in short time with weak magnetic field is hard.

1,@annerajb @flcnhvy @DrivingSlate @TeslaParaTodos @JenniferSensiba @cleantechnica @28delayslater Maybe active in a month or so. Focus right now is getting to high speed; tight follow distance in test tunnel.
1,@annerajb @flcnhvy @DrivingSlate @TeslaParaTodos @JenniferSensiba @cleantechnica @28delayslater Yes; exciting potential
1,@flcnhvy @DrivingSlate @TeslaParaTodos @JenniferSensiba @cleantechnica @28delayslater Exactly
1,@annerajb @lrocket @Alexis_wwww @katlinegrey Printers are too small. Also; high pressure; high efficiency engines need copper cooling channels with an inco/steel jacket. Can’t print yet.

1,@SpaceXUpdates @CanzyD Including Heavy; which is 3 cores; around 20 or so
1,@nextspaceflight Depends on when Crew Dragon comes back. That’s scheduled for launch next Saturday; but lot of new hardware; so time error bars are big.
1,@CanzyD High probability of this particular rocket getting destroyed by Dragon supersonic abort test. Otherwise; at least 20 or 30 missions for Falcon 9. Starship will take over before the F9 fleet reaches end of life.

1,@DJSnM @Erdayastronaut @sasor098 @AdamHugo @WayCharMar @fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey You can see the streaks on the vacuum Merlin nozzle in flight videos
1,@DJSnM @Erdayastronaut @sasor098 @AdamHugo @WayCharMar @fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey Pinter injector tends to have hot &amp; cold streaks. Hot streaks burn a rut at the throat that accelerates erosion.
1,@benoitdenayer @navincho @katlinegrey Essentially; yes. Great engineering talent; but should focus on reusable rockets for purpose of a permanent human base on the moon and self-sustaining city on Mars.
1,@RichPitre_CO @katlinegrey We are constrained by the accredited investor rule; but will think about how this could be done
1,@Erdayastronaut @sasor098 @AdamHugo @WayCharMar @fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey Yeah; that was a bit embarrassing ☺️High engine chamber pressure and ablative don’t get along. Ok for low pressure; expendable upper stage.
1,@sasor098 @AdamHugo @WayCharMar @fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey That’s true 😀 Merlin 1A was terrible. 1C was ok; 1D good; but block 5 Merlin (should probably be called 1E) is something special. Took about 15 years to get there.
1,@Erdayastronaut @MarekCyzio @katlinegrey Actually; they received (and still receive) almost a billion dollars a year for “launch capability”. Even if they do zero launches; US govt still gives them that.
1,@Geopilot @katlinegrey Don’t know
1,@katlinegrey SpaceX commercial 🚀 launch market share went from 0% in 2010 to 65% in 2018. Despite massive subsidies to Boeing/Lockeed; they have never won a fair competition against SpaceX for several years. https://t.co/sqAYCCcJtd
1,@martinengwicht @macodiseas @katlinegrey Exactly. That’s the critical point for Starship/BFR: more payload than the biggest rocket ever made; but for less money per launch than the smallest (orbital) rocket. Without something that lowers orbital flight cost by 100X; humanity will never be a multiplanet species.
1,@fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey SpaceX Merlin architecture is simpler than staged combustion (eg SSME or RD); but it has world record for thrust/weight &amp; thrust/cost engine. Raptor has better Isp; but I’m worried it may fall short on those two critical metrics.

1,@epoxy101 @Robotbeat @John_Gardi @SpaceX At least 10X cheaper
1,@SPEXcast @Robotbeat @John_Gardi @SpaceX Very dependent on volume; but I’m confident moving to Mars (return ticket is free) will one day cost less than $500k &amp; maybe even below $100k. Low enough that most people in advanced economies could sell their home on Earth &amp; move to Mars if they want.
1,@Robotbeat @John_Gardi @SpaceX This will sound implausible; but I think there’s a path to build Starship / Super Heavy for less than Falcon 9
1,@13ericralph31 @John_Gardi @SpaceX Close
1,@John_Gardi @SpaceX But not an extendable nozzle though; as that just saves length. Nozzle diameter is limited by body diameter.
1,@SpaceXFan97 @alexmd2 @SpaceX Much above 300 bar main chamber pressure means extreme oxygen preburner pressure of 700 to 800+ bar. Definitely pushing the limit of known physics.
1,@_cgp @SpaceX Propellant was not deep cryo. CH4 &amp; O2 were just barely below liquid temp at 1 bar. In theory; Raptor should do ~300 bar at deep cryo; provided everything holds together; which is far from certain. However; only 250 bar is needed for nominal operation of Starship/Super Heavy.
1,@John_Gardi @SpaceX Yes; aiming for 380 sec Isp with vac nozzle. Maybe 382 if we get lucky.

1,@Erdayastronaut @LytovchenkoSerg @John_Gardi Booster center of mass is much lower &amp; more consistent (no payload mass to consider); so still biases towards engine first entry
1,@LytovchenkoSerg @John_Gardi @Erdayastronaut Technically; the steel is radiatively cooled (not uncooled). T^4 is one of the most interesting things about reality!
1,@LytovchenkoSerg @John_Gardi @Erdayastronaut Rocket booster temperatures won’t go much above 600 Kelvin on hottest parts of main body &amp; maybe around 1200K on base; which uncooled steel can handle. Starship is around 1700K for a Mach 25 entry; so needs shielding of some kind.

1,@Erdayastronaut @dguisinger @DanielDavisA Gaseous CH4/O2 &amp; heavy duty spark plugs. Basically; a 💨 of insane power 😀
1,@jclishman @dguisinger @Erdayastronaut @DanielDavisA Will do; although SpaceX reddit is very well-informed. Really impressive analysis by some commenters.
1,@dguisinger @Erdayastronaut @DanielDavisA Engine use methox torch igniters. Green tinge is either camera saturation or a tiny bit of copper from the chamber.
1,First firing of Starship Raptor flight engine! So proud of great work by @SpaceX team!! https://t.co/S6aT7Jih4S

1,@122ddd2223d @Dash71209069 @yungmruglygod @nickynaptime We’ll tweak the alloy over time; so it won’t exactly be 301; but close
1,@AlexTheChemist @SpaceX Well; my past mistakes do seem extremely dumb; especially the ones where I mistakenly thought I was smart
1,@nickynaptime Rocket mass ratio is about the same for aluminum-lithium vs 301 stainless full hard at cryo; but latter costs way less; is tougher &amp; doesn’t even need paint!
1,@SpaceXFan97 @wonderofscience @Treebeard1671 @Erdayastronaut @keego73 Still up to 31. Will probably fly with fewer initially in case it blows up.
1,@wonderofscience @Treebeard1671 @Erdayastronaut @keego73 Mostly true
1,@Erdayastronaut @keego73 Cold gas thrusters only. Will use body flaps &amp; main engines for landing orientation; so won’t need high thrust reaction control. Simplifies things considerably.
1,Initially making one 200 metric ton thrust engine common across ship &amp; booster to reach the moon as fast as possible. Next versions will split to vacuum-optimized (380+ sec Isp) &amp; sea-level thrust optimized (~250 ton).
1,Preparing to fire the Starship Raptor engine at @SpaceX Texas https://t.co/8JCOi1BG6z
1,@Treebeard1671 @Erdayastronaut @keego73 Yes. It’s very rare to find all three.
1,@Erdayastronaut @keego73 To be clear; I’m confident that a stainless steel ship will be lighter than advanced aluminum or carbon fiber; because of strength to weight vs temperature &amp; reduced need for heat shielding
1,@Erdayastronaut @keego73 Yes; ship needs pitch/roll/yaw control across wide Mach regime &amp; angle of attack
1,@Erdayastronaut @keego73 Absolutely. You’ve touched on a very important point. The ship must be easy to repair on the moon and Mars.
1,@iamshack24 @orthereaboot @toxicpath @librab103 And Tesla Gigafactory is steadily becoming self-powered by solar

1,@farismahdawi @NASA @Space_Station The youth love em
1,If test flight of 🐉 goes well next month; @NASA 👨‍🚀 👩‍🚀 will 🚀 to @Space_Station this summer!
1,@Robotbeat @zackpio Actual tanks are fine
1,@Teslarati ~1750K is peak heating expected on about 20% of Starship for LEO entry; ~1600K on 20%. Rest drops below 1450K; so no heat shield needed. Radiative cooling at T^4 takes care of 60% of the ship. Another reason for steel.
1,@Teslarati 310S stainless is better for high temp outer skin; as it can take ~1450 Kelvin; so active cooling with cryogenic fuel only has to mitigate 300 degrees of delta temp
1,@CabsandSurfaces Almost ready to roll out. Regulators just approved.
1,@teslamodel3fan @Tesla Since it’s part of safety &amp; security; all cars with AP2+ hardware will get it
1,Tesla Sentry Mode coming soon for all cars with Enhanced Autopilot
1,@DevClub_Space @RationalEtienne @PopMech Yes. Also; despite high outside heat; rapid water vaporization can counter-intuitively cause it to snap freeze &amp; block cooling channels.
1,@thecla6771 Coming soon. Lots of unique road markings &amp; signs in each country.
1,@PopMech When going to ~1750 Kelvin; specific heat is more important than latent heat of vaporization; which is why cryogenic fuel is a slightly better choice than water

1,@thirionremi @Tesla Thanks; good idea!
1,@FredericLambert Yes; ending on Feb 1. It’s adding too much cost to the cars; especially Model 3.
1,@gooseSD22 @lovin_ny93 Order must occur before Feb 1
1,@lovin_ny93 No; the whole referral incentive system will end
1,The Tesla customer referral program will end on Feb 1. If you want to refer a friend to buy a Tesla &amp; give them 6 months of free Supercharging; please do so before then.
1,@MKBHD @BenSullins @cleantechnica I think some of them should combine forces. Talent is spread too thin.
1,@WevolverApp @SpaceX Dragon 2 was originally designed to land with thrusters; but it’s not the right architecture for heavy transport to the moon or Mars; so we decided not to qualify it for thruster landings
1,@cleantechnica How many electric vehicle startups are there? Seems like a lot.
1,@musicnick1985 @Teslarati Teslarati is very thoughtful &amp; well-written; but this stems from a miscommunication by SpaceX
1,@nextspaceflight @Teslarati The LA Times has a long track of unreasonable attacks on SpaceX &amp; Tesla; but in this case it was our miscommunication
1,@Teslarati The source info is incorrect. Starship &amp; Raptor development is being done out of our HQ in Hawthorne; CA. We are building the Starship prototypes locally at our launch site in Texas; as their size makes them very difficult to transport.
1,@mcannonbrookes Haha you’re welcome! Hope you’re doing well.
1,@greensjeremy @boringcompany @mcannonbrookes About $15M/km for a two way high speed transit; so probably around $750M plus maybe $50M/station

1,@ole_sveberg @MKBHD I don’t think the law fully anticipated this situation. So probably yes for a while.

1,Wow; this is cool!
1,@Noahpinion This is definitely real? Dang.
1,@cenkuygur My guess is that he did; but the suicide would have been stopped if the guards were there or the camera was functional; so it was likely assisted.  He may have been promised something in exchange for killing himself. That’s what I’m curious about.

1,There is a shortage of top notch air traffic controllers. If you have retired; but are open to returning to work; please consider doing so.
1,Hundreds of federal workers are being promoted daily every time we encounter excellence. The @DOGE team will be more clear about this.   The goal is to make the federal government a meritocracy as much as possible.
1,Many such situations.   Government funding to “non-governmental” organizations goes through various money-laundering shell companies until reaching guys like Raskin.
1,The taxpayer savings receipts; including corrections when mistakes are made; are posted on the DOGE website.   When there are complaints; they should be directed towards specific items; but they just yell “constitutional crisis!” and avoid mention of specific line items.

1,@farzyness And live on X
1,Indeed; it is essential to reduce the budget deficit to match economic growth!  We will get the 2026 deficit to ~3% of GDP. Sensible deregulation will ensure that economic growth is ~3% or higher.   That will both DEFEAT INFLATION and REDUCE INTEREST RATES for all Americans!
1,Norm Eisen stole $17 million of YOUR MONEY to “promote democracy” and used it for a muppet show.   Sounds like a crime …

1,Correct. The parasites are thrashing hard.
1,This is what I mean by the woke mind virus. The more I learn; the more insidious and deadly it appears.   Maybe the biggest existential danger to humanity is having it programmed into the AI; as is the case for every AI besides @Grok. Even for Grok; it’s tough to remove; because

1,@kerpen Yeah
1,@farzyness @jonstewart @TheDailyShow Jon pretends to be moderate; but is very far left. His piece was thoroughly disingenuous and misleading.
1,More of your tax dollars saved!  Most of these items are mundane and may not seem like much individually; but there are millions of minor savings that add up to billions of dollars cumulatively.   Ultimately; there will be a trillion+ dollars of waste and fraud eliminated.
1,@NikoWrex Good improvement
1,@Noahpinion Yeah
1,It is the only way
1,@iruletheworldmo Weed gummies are a hell of a drug
1,@Noahpinion I got no problem with trans adults. Just leave kids alone.
1,Unfortunately; as President Bukele eloquently articulates; there is no other option.   We must impeach to save democracy.
1,Ahem; we said 5 items and that’s only 4
1,If ANY judge ANYWHERE can block  EVERY Presidential order EVERYWHERE;  we do NOT have democracy; we have TYRANNY of the JUDICIARY.
1,Nuts
1,@FarzadMediaINC @jonstewart @TheDailyShow I will do it if the show airs unedited
1,People want their money spent wisely. Simple as that.

1,Do you trust the government?
1,Good
1,This is an amazing story and exactly what @DOGE aims to do!  The federal government has a MUCH larger amount of WASTE &amp; FRAUD than a local or state government could ever have; because it can always print more money.   Unfortunately; there is no free lunch and that extra money
1,@JDVance True
1,On one hand; @DOGE computer nerds review government data to eliminate waste &amp; fraud.   On the other hand; demented creeps at intelligence agencies spy on you at will.  Which is of greater concern?
1,@visegrad24 Hold an election

1,@torybruno @Dynetics When do the engines arrive? 😉
1,@SpaceX Unfortunately; launch is called off for today; as an aircraft entered the “keep out zone”; which is unreasonably gigantic.   There is simply no way that humanity can become a spacefaring civilization without major regulatory reform. The current regulatory system is broken.

1,@kelvin61942434 That is an exciting goal!

1,@TeslaGong @torybruno At least a few years before Starlink revenue is reasonably predictable. Going public sooner than that would be very painful. Will do my best to give long-term Tesla shareholders preference.
1,Shout out to the awesome Tesla global team. Thanks for working so hard to make Tesla successful!
1,@torybruno Good chart. This is a major reason why we moved Starlink from ~1100km orbit to ~550km. Atmosphere automatically clears the lower altitude within a few years; so space junk cannot accumulate.
1,@JRossNicoll This is an important improvement

1,@ajtourville The Plaid carbon-wrapped motor is arguably the most advanced motor on Earth outside of maybe a lab somewhere. We have to keep some secrets!   We have a few ideas for increasing torque &amp; max rpm even further for new Roadster. Definitely fun &amp; exciting engineering ahead!
1,@ajtourville Main advantage of this is a much stronger EM field compared with a rotor that is held together by metal (usually high strength steel).   Other advantage is that rotor can go to higher RPM; as carbon sleeve (mostly) stops copper rotor from expanding due to radial acceleration.
1,@ajtourville Fiber is wound over rotor at high tension load. Machine to do this was made by Tesla Automation.  Carbon sleeve must put copper rotor in compression or it loosens at low temp due to differential thermal expansion.   Preload is also helpful for maintaining precise gap to stator.

1,@leastImAlive @PPathole Yeah; sold my houses; except for 1 in Bay Area that’s rented out for events.

1,@nextspaceflight @NASASpaceflight @BocaChicaGal @SpaceX 29 Raptors on Booster initially; rising to 32 later this year; along with thrust increase per engine. Aiming for &gt;7500 ton thrust long-term. T/W ~1.5.
1,@blockfolio Great idea
1,@teslaownersSV @TeslaNY Dark Helmet emotes Plaid well
1,@OwenSparks_ @TeslaNY Actually true haha
1,@TeslaNY Basically; our entire product roadmap is from Spaceballs 🤣🤣
1,@boringcompany Congrats Boring Company team!
1,Model S Plaid delivery pushed to June 10. Needs one more week of tweak.  This car feels like a spaceship. Words cannot describe the limbic resonance.
1,@skorusARK Exactly. Atmospheric drag clearing out orbital debris is a major reason why we dropped altitude to ~550km.
1,@KosukeGoto2013 I suspect that name made him strong
1,@blueorigin For the low; low price of … ?
1,Ship 16 &amp; Booster 2; Starbase Highbay https://t.co/IUuidOw9ym
1,@Model3Owners Tesla sure would appreciate changing the law; so that this is not required!
1,@waitbutwhy @poweredbyart Exactly
1,@RationalEtienne @SciGuySpace Potentially; 1000 times higher
1,@AlexSvanArt @Neopork85 Pretty close. No tiles on back side of flaps. Some tiles towards leeward side of ship trailing plasma spilling off rear of flaps.
1,@SciGuySpace Cumulative payload to orbit is the really crazy number. Falcon has delivered more than double rest of world combined over trailing 12 months.
1,If only they had spaceships; they’d still be around
1,Deep thots https://t.co/J5mJff7IIL
1,@WholeMarsBlog Not sure who wrote this; but it’s accurate https://t.co/gRvWxOJZ56
1,@Astro_Elliott @Teslarati @ResidentSponge Aiming to have hot gas thrusters on booster for first orbital flight
1,@IlyaRosenberg @Caspar_Stanley @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX @SuperHeavyBN3 They are now the same (LOX below CH4). Ox is 3.5 times heavier than fuel; so makes sense to have it lower.
1,@Teslarati @ResidentSponge Pure vision Autopilot is now rolling out in North America. There will be an update of this production release in 2 weeks; then FSD beta V9.0 (also pure vision) a week later. FSD subscription will be enabled around the same time.
1,@Teslarati @13ericralph31 Exactly 🤣🤣
1,@Caspar_Stanley @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX @SuperHeavyBN3 Lot of plumbing!
1,@itsALLrisky Please note Dogecoin has no formal organization &amp; no one reports to me; so my ability to take action is limited
1,@heydave7 @dogecoin_devs Doge has dogs &amp; memes; whereas the others do not
1,Someone suggested changing Dogecoin fees based on phases of the moon; which is pretty awesome haha
1,If you’d like to help develop Doge; please submit ideas on GitHub &amp; https://t.co/liAPQMFaQB @dogecoin_devs
1,Spoke with North American Bitcoin miners. They committed to publish current &amp; planned renewable usage &amp; to ask miners WW to do so. Potentially promising.
1,@Cointelegraph He fears the … https://t.co/78WzM5ICjA
1,@SpaceNews_Inc Congrats! @virgingalactic
1,@flcnhvy @thatdogegirl @WhatsupFranks @TeslaGong Becoming multiplanetary is one of the greatest filters. Only now; 4.5 billion years after Earth formed; is it possible.   How long this window to reach Mars remains open is uncertain. Perhaps a long time; perhaps not.   In case it is the latter; we should act now.
1,@PPathole @SpaceX The hard part about Raptor is simplifying it
1,@TheRealShifo The true battle is between fiat &amp; crypto. On balance; I support the latter.
1,Any sufficiently advanced magic is indistinguishable from technology
1,@RocketRundown Welcome to the future. It’s gonna be great.
1,@jimfarley98 Congrats!
1,@teslaownersSV This will actually be able to fly very briefly. I always laughed at flying cars &amp; now making one. Fate 🖤 irony haha.
1,@AstroJordy @Tesla We can’t wait to build this crazy truck! It’s a total rethink of vehicle mechanical architecture &amp; production methods; so super hard project; but worthwhile in the end.
1,@BTCsessions @TeslaGong @wintonARK Achieving truly decentralized finance – power to the people – is a noble &amp; important goal.   Layer count depends on projected bandwidth &amp; compute; both rising rapidly; which means single layer network can carry all human transactions in future imo.  For now; Lightning is needed.
1,@TeslaGong @wintonARK Ideally 0.1kWh; calculated as total energy used by system divided by max transaction rate
1,@BLKMDL3 @TeslaGong @wintonARK Yes; with the SpaceX rocket thruster option package. It will be safe; but very intense. Probably not wise for those with a medical condition – same as a hardcore roller coaster.
1,@TeslaGong @wintonARK Bitcoin hashing (aka mining) energy usage is starting to exceed that of medium-sized countries. Almost impossible for small hashers to succeed without those massive economies of scale.
1,@wintonARK I agree that this *can* be done over time; but recent extreme energy usage growth could not possibly have been done so fast with renewables.  This question is easily resolved if the top 10 hashing orgs just post audited numbers of renewable energy vs not.
1,@heydave7 Yeah; I haven’t &amp; won’t sell any Doge
1,@heydave7 A longtime Tesla supporter gave me the Doge dollar sticker at Giga Berlin
1,@flcnhvy @MarcusHouse Oh sorry; yes; Roadster will have thrusters; not Plaid. Plaid is indeed close to the theoretical maximum of a roadworthy car without special devices.
1,@MarcusHouse It will have high pressure air rocket thrusters behind a license plate that flips down. Bong; James Bong …
1,@austinbarnard45 Good idea
1,@austinbarnard45 Sure
1,@thatdogegirl @WhatsupFranks @TeslaGong Worth reading
1,@WhatsupFranks @TeslaGong Currency is already digital! Decentralized crypto is an attempt to wrest power of currency dilution (pernicious form of taxation) &amp; capital controls from governments. That said; I sure hope the cure is better than the disease!  Mars/AI are essential to passing the great filter/s.
1,@TeslaGong That is my gaming laptop; which has never had a sticker until now
1,@Teslarati Diess is right. Hydrogen is a staggeringly dumb form of energy storage for cars. Barely worth considering it for a rocket upper stage; which is its most compelling use.
1,How much is that Doge in the window? https://t.co/bxTkWOr50V
1,Tesla Model S Plaid delivery event June 3 at our California factory  Fastest production car ever 0 to 60mph in under 2 secs

1,Credit to our Master of Coin
1,@Tesmanian_com Ferragu is remarkably insightful
1,@joergstb Great progress so far! Thank you for the support from Brandenburg. I would also like to express appreciation for the permit authorities; as I know this is a large and complex project.   When all the finishing touches are done; I hope it will be considered a jewel of Brandenburg!
1,Aiming for extreme precision with next gen Model Y – microns; not millimeters
1,Giga Berlin suppliers please accelerate!
1,@PPathole I worked for Peter Nicholson; who is awesome. Mostly; we exchanged math riddles; although I did figure out a multi-billion dollar arbitrage opportunity for the bank. Figured they’d at least give me $1/hour raise; but no … https://t.co/rdjDtPtPHz
1,@vincent13031925 Going through all aspects of next gen Model Y production system with team. Lot of talented people at Giga Berlin. This place will rock!
1,@BTC_Archive To clarify speculation; Tesla has not sold any Bitcoin
1,@CryptoWhale Indeed
1,@ChainLinkGod @PeterMcCormack Hey cryptocurrency “experts”; ever heard of PayPal? It’s possible … maybe … that I know than you realize about how money works.
1,@ChainLinkGod @PeterMcCormack Bitcoin is actually highly centralized; with supermajority controlled by handful of big mining (aka hashing) companies.   A single coal mine in Xinjiang flooded; almost killing miners; and Bitcoin hash rate dropped 35%. Sound “decentralized” to you?  https://t.co/Oom8yzGRNQ
1,@poisonouspinups @michael_saylor He should wear outfit for Halloween; but with “Bitcoin” tattooed high on thighs
1,@michael_saylor Saylor Moon
1,@PeterMcCormack Obnoxious threads like this make me want to go all in on Doge
1,@TeslaHype Coming soon. Sorry for the delay!
1,@loshan1212 @itsALLrisky For those bad at math 👆; 100X higher transaction volume with 100X lower fees means total fees earned stay same. Low fees &amp; high volume are needed to become currency of Earth.
1,@PPathole @long_elon @itsALLrisky My understanding is that the big accounts are exchanges. Would be good to confirm though. Am told the biggest one is Robinhood.
1,@long_elon @itsALLrisky Only if Doge can’t do it. Big pain in the neck to create another one.
1,@itsALLrisky Ideally; Doge speeds up block time 10X; increases block size 10X &amp; drops fee 100X. Then it wins hands down.
1,@SciGuySpace Yes; hardware-in-the-loop testing of software is essential
1,@DJSnM We need to make sure ship won’t break up on reentry; hence deorbit over Pacific
1,@teslaownersSV 3/4 of the way around the Earth

1,@SpaceNews_Inc @googlecloud Locating ground stations at data centers will significantly improve latency &amp; jitter. Data can go from user terminal to server without touching the Internet.
1,Working with Doge devs to improve system transaction efficiency. Potentially promising.
1,@ID_AA_Carmack I have a lot of respect for anyone who ships useful product at scale. It is insanely hard work.
1,To be clear; I strongly believe in crypto; but it can’t drive a massive increase in fossil fuel use; especially coal
1,It is high time there was a carbon tax!
1,Energy usage trend over past few months is insane https://t.co/E6o9s87trw https://t.co/bmv9wotwKe
1,@WholeMarsBlog Haha
1,@garyblack00 Subscription rolls out in about a month
1,@Dreamweaver2oh @garyblack00 I think we’re maybe a month or two away from wide beta. But these things are hard to predict accurately.   The work we had to do for pure vision driving was needed for FSD; so much more progress has been made than it would seem.
1,@flcnhvy @garyblack00 End of year; along with FSD; provided we get regulatory approval. Smart Summon is just a subset of FSD.
1,@garyblack00 We had to focus on removing radar &amp; confirming safety. That release goes out next week to US production. Then a week or two to polish pure vision FSD &amp; v9 beta will release. Difference between v8 &amp; v9 is gigantic.

1,@WholeMarsBlog Exactly!
1,@teslaownersSV Was using this in my car last night
1,@teslaownersSV FSD display V9.0 will show actual probability distribution of objects – true mind’s eye of the neural net. This is so cool!
1,@WhatsupFranks @danheld I swear Canada FSD beta will be as soon as humanly possible!
1,@adamcarter @teslaownersSV @TeslaNY @Tesla True. Anyone paying attention to the rate of improvement will realize that Tesla Autopilot/FSD is already superhuman for highway driving &amp; swiftly getting there for city streets.
1,@jgrano305 @tobyliiiiiiiiii @teslaownersSV @TeslaNY @Tesla Hopefully; later this year for several more states. Insurance is different for almost every state in America &amp; regulatory approvals take time.
1,@tobyliiiiiiiiii @teslaownersSV @TeslaNY @Tesla And hopefully EU this summer
1,@tobyliiiiiiiiii @teslaownersSV @TeslaNY @Tesla Probably a few months. There are many subtle differences between US &amp; Canada driving.
1,@teslaownersSV @TeslaNY @Tesla Gating factor is achieving &amp; proving higher safety with pure vision than with vision+radar. We are almost there.  FSD Beta V9.0 will blow your mind.
1,@teslaownersSV @TeslaNY @Tesla Probably two weeks

1,@Erdayastronaut @Twisi80 Testing header tanks. All good so far.
1,@leastImAlive @thesheetztweetz They have an important role to play in protecting the public from getting swindled; but are sometimes too close to Wall St hedge funds imo.   Strange that they aren’t taking more action on some of the SPACs.
1,@thesheetztweetz FCC is fair &amp; sensible. NHTSA &amp; FAA too. 99.9% of the time; I agree with regulators!   On rare occasions; we disagree. This is almost always due to new technologies that past regulations didn’t anticipate.
1,@garyblack00 Other companies spend money on advertising &amp; manipulating public opinion; Tesla focuses on the product.   I trust the people.
1,@garyblack00 @CGrantWSJ @WSJ I find it more helpful to read/follow individual journalists; rather than publications.   Any given publication is going to have wide range of views; albeit vast majority of stories about any subject are negative; perhaps reflecting innate human biases.  Citizen journalism FTW!
1,Starship SN15 static fire completed; preparing for flight later this week
1,@jeff_foust True 🤣🤣
1,@kchangnyt Can’t get it up (to orbit) lol
1,@heydave7 Seems quite likely at least based on revenue in 2022 &amp; possibly total units in 2023
1,@stoolpresidente No; you do not. I have not sold any of my Bitcoin. Tesla sold 10% of its holdings essentially to prove liquidity of Bitcoin as an alternative to holding cash on balance sheet.
1,@Orangetilt Yeah; roughly 200MW/km^2 using currently available solar panels.   What’s really amazing is that you can store all energy needed to power a continent overnight with 1 square kilometer of stacked Tesla Megapacks!
1,@PPathole An advantage I did have is that my father is a talented electrical &amp; mechanical engineer; so I was taught a lot engineering (without appreciating it at the time)
1,@PPathole True. The opposite in fact – I provide financial support to my parents.

1,@hnshah Haha
1,@AstroJordy I’m staying at a friend’s place in Florida that is 85% powered by Tesla Solar Roof + Powerwall.   When grid power goes down; air-conditioning automatically turns off in some of the house. Computers &amp; lights don’t even flicker. Owner says he doesn’t notice.
1,@28delayslater Does seem a little weird
1,@JohnnaCrider1 @WholeMarsBlog If Tesla owners are “conspiracy theorists”; then it would be fair to call them “advertising salespeople masquerading as truthtellers”.   If that’s an unfair criticism; a simple rebuttal would be to show their articles per fatality for all automakers. Tesla is  ~0.02% of deaths …
1,Tesla Solar + Powerwall battery enables consumers to be their own utility
1,@jack True
1,@ValaAfshar Very important. Most people don’t know this. Wind is also super cheap; especially when paired with batteries.
1,@annerajb Newest units can probably do as much as 10kW continuous &amp; double that in peak power at 30C ambient temp.  In house power vernacular; this translates to ~80LRA (soft start of 3.5 ton HVAC). Two Powerwalls would double this; three would triple; etc.
1,Powerwall 2 peak &amp; steady power capability is better than advertised.   Now that we have lots of operational data; Tesla can unlock higher capabilities for free via software update next month.   Depending on production date; power increase power may be &gt;50% at 30C ambient temp.
1,Solar power will feed exclusively to Powerwall. Powerwall will interface only between utility meter &amp; house main breaker panel; enabling super simple install &amp; seamless whole house backup during utility dropouts.
1,Starting next week; Tesla Solar Panels &amp; Solar Roof will only be sold as an integrated product *with* Tesla Powerwall battery
1,@wintonARK Did you buy a Powerwall? Utility permission is required for flowing electricity back to grid; but usually not if stored in our battery. This also enables 24/7 electricity security for your home.  Utility permission is still needed for when Powerwall is full &amp; can stabilize grid.
1,@TeslaNY Sandy Munro knows what he’s talking about
1,@PPathole @Tesla @SpaceX I could get a job; just not at an Internet company (weren’t many back then)
1,@Liv_Boeree @TheBabylonBee Haha true
1,@kimpaquette New FSD rendering approach coming that better represents NN probability vector space
1,@kimpaquette NHTSA is great
1,@RenataKonkoly @GerberKawasaki Hell of a coincidence haha
1,@WholeMarsBlog Exactly
1,@NASA Awesome!
1,@Amart15416132 @WSJ Your research as a private individual is better than professionals @WSJ!   Data logs recovered so far show Autopilot was not enabled &amp; this car did not purchase FSD.  Moreover; standard Autopilot would require lane lines to turn on; which this street did not have.
1,@teslaownersSV @SpaceX @NASA @considercosmos Support for humanity’s future in space is super appreciated. Let’s make the sci-fi future we want real!
1,@WholeMarsBlog Essentially; passive Autopilot (car intervenes only when crash probability is high) cuts crashes in half.   Active Autopilot (car is driving itself) cuts crashes in half again.   Doesn’t mean there are no crashes; but; on balance; Autopilot is unequivocally safer.
1,Tesla with Autopilot engaged now approaching 10 times lower chance of accident than average vehicle

1,Make life multiplanetary! #Mars
1,@Erdayastronaut @thesheetztweetz Yeah; should be fully mobile later this year; so you can move it anywhere or use it on an RV or truck in motion. We need a few more satellite launches to achieve compete coverage &amp; some key software upgrades.
1,@thesheetztweetz This is accurate. Service uptime; bandwidth &amp; latency are improving rapidly. Probably out of beta this summer.
1,@lexfridman One of many reasons that we need to make life multiplanetary!
1,@austinbarnard45 Aiming to launch next week

1,@RationalEtienne @F9Block5 While perhaps obvious in hindsight; it turns out that the only way to solve self-driving is to solve a big part of real-world AI. That is what Tesla is doing; both in hardware &amp; software.  Unless a company is good at AI with tight compute; it’s hopeless. This is insanely hard.
1,@SpaceXMR Soon it will be real
1,@janixos @ErcXspace @SpaceX Actually; yes. And Red Rocket truck stop.

1,@AstroJordy @dogeofficialceo @F9Block5 Insanely cute!
1,@WholeMarsBlog Button timing of May is aspirational. Depends on how well limited beta of V9.0 goes; but I would be surprised if wide beta (aka button) is later than June. FSD subscription next month is a sure thing.
1,@cliffski @F9Block5 Hopefully addressed this summer
1,@BLKMDL3 @F9Block5 Same timing
1,@F9Block5 Major improvements are being made to the vision stack every week. Beta button hopefully next month.  This is a “march of 9’s” trying to get probability of no injury above 99.999999% of miles for city driving. Production Autopilot is already above that for highway driving.
1,@jrosinski97 Will investigate
1,@melaniemadri Probably late July
1,Tesla AI/Autopilot engineering is awesome! Making excellent progress solving real-world AI.
1,@ErcXspace @SpaceX 69th Raptor engine coming soon
1,@ashleevance Maybe it’s about how you use it
1,@PPathole @SwiftOnSecurity Getting there
1,@AstroJordy @PPathole @SpaceX @Tesla That version of Falcon 1 never flew; so must be ~2004. The CAD looks so simple! I think we were still using SolidWorks back then.
1,@eugenelee3 @PPathole @SpaceX @Tesla Yeah; not scalable. My grad student idea was to try to use advanced chip making equipment to create high energy density capacitors accurate to molecular level.
1,@PPathole @SpaceX @Tesla That was my night job. Day job was working on ruthenium-tantalum ultracapacitors at Pinnacle Research.
1,@PPathole @SpaceX @Tesla True. Ancient times … Had to flip CPU registers explicitly; as computer was so slow.
1,@Erdayastronaut @Tesla Absolutely
1,@Erdayastronaut @Tesla Tesla is building up collision repair capability to help address the grief that you went through; but usually insurance companies make you go their “approved” collision repair partners. Tesla Insurance will make it smooth sailing.

1,@DrPhiltill Good thread
1,@alexellisuk Pretty much
1,@tesla_adri @WholeMarsBlog These things are best thought of as probabilities. There are 5 forward-facing cameras. It is highly likely that at least one of them will see multiple cars ahead.
1,@WholeMarsBlog Sensors are a bitstream and cameras have several orders of magnitude more bits/sec than radar (or lidar).   Radar must meaningfully increase signal/noise of bitstream to be worth complexity of integrating it.   As vision processing gets better; it just leaves radar far behind.
1,@WholeMarsBlog When radar and vision disagree; which one do you believe? Vision has much more precision; so better to double down on vision than do sensor fusion.

1,@IheartTesla Absolutely doable. Possibly as soon as Neuralink device version 2; highly likely by version 3.
1,Later versions will be able to shunt signals from Neuralinks in brain to Neuralinks in body motor/sensory neuron clusters; thus enabling; for example; paraplegics to walk again
1,First @Neuralink product will enable someone with paralysis to use a smartphone with their mind faster than someone using thumbs

1,@SciGuySpace Global payload to orbit is the key metric
1,@Julius_Burton @Erdayastronaut @DJSnM @NASASpaceflight @ChrisG_NSF @thejackbeyer @FelixSchlang Nice
1,@_Jevis_ @PPathole Ideal scenario imo is catching Starship in horizontal “glide” with no landing burn; although that is quite a challenge for the tower! Next best is catching with tower; with emergency pad landing mode on skirt (no legs).
1,@PPathole Starship booster; largest flying object ever designed; will be caught out of sky by launch tower. Big step forward; as reflight can be done in under an hour.

1,@Erdayastronaut @LabPadre Barely a scratch. :) Back on the stand soon! Will report conclusions as soon as we know them.
1,Starbase will grow by several thousand people over the next year or two
1,@OwenSparks_ I sure hope so!
1,@OwenSparks_ Agreed! We’re not super far; as Magic Valley Utility can give us almost all wind-power; which will be used for LOX (78% of propellant mass)/N2/argon distillation. We’re also aiming to increase solar power from 1MW to 10MW; paired with Tesla Megapacks; for continuous power.
1,Probably most “in space” you could possibly feel by being in a glass dome
1,Am donating $20M to Cameron County schools &amp; $10M to City of Brownsville for downtown revitalization. Details to follow next week.
1,@Adamklotz_ @SpaceX BN1 is a manufacturing pathfinder; so will be scrapped. We learned a lot; but have already changed design to BN2.   Goal is to get BN2 with engines on orbital pad before end of April. It might even be orbit-capable if we are lucky.
1,Please consider moving to Starbase or greater Brownsville/South Padre area in Texas &amp; encourage friends to do so!   SpaceX’s hiring needs for engineers; technicians; builders &amp; essential support personnel of all kinds are growing rapidly.
1,@CodingMark @Adamklotz_ @SpaceX More like V10.0
1,@Adamklotz_ @SpaceX Next major technology rev is at SN20. Those ships will be orbit-capable with heat shield &amp; stage separation system. Ascent success probability is high.  However; SN20+ vehicles will probably need many flight attempts to survive Mach 25 entry heating &amp; land intact.
1,@Adamklotz_ @SpaceX SN15 rolls to launch pad in a few days. It has hundreds of design improvements across structures; avionics/software &amp; engine.   Hopefully; one of those improvements covers this problem. If not; then retrofit will add a few more days.
1,@SpaceX Looks like engine 2 had issues on ascent &amp; didn’t reach operating chamber pressure during landing burn; but; in theory; it wasn’t needed.   Something significant happened shortly after landing burn start. Should know what it was once we can examine the bits later today.
1,@SpaceX At least the crater is in the right place!
1,@SpaceX A high production rate solves many ills
1,@Tesmanian_com Demand is no problem; but near-term cell supply makes it hard to scale Semi. This limitation will be less onerous next year.

1,@WholeMarsBlog Like @CyberpunkGame; but *with* self-driving haha
1,@PPathole @arstechnica @SciGuySpace If 2021 manifest is met; SpaceX will do ~75% of total Earth payload to orbit with Falcon.  A single Starship is designed to do in a day what all rockets on Earth currently do in a year.   Even so; ~1000 Starships will take ~20 years to build a self-sustaining city on Mars.
1,@arstechnica @SciGuySpace Falcon 9 is almost always at max capacity. When it has “spare” performance; it flies back to land; which costs much less than using a droneship.  Our fundamental constraint is mass to orbit per unit time. Last year; SpaceX launched roughly double payload mass of rest of world.
1,@WholeMarsBlog @Herbert_Diess Fuel cells should be called fool sells! Such a silly choice for cars. Not great even for a rocket upper stage imo; but at least not absurd.
1,@PPathole I was just up there. Elevator on the other side. Floor is in; glass coming soon.
1,@Erdayastronaut @tobyliiiiiiiiii @NASASpaceflight Yeah; we talked about that internally. Could just have it land on a big net or bouncy castle. Lacks dignity; but would work. But; optimized landing propellant is only ~5% of dry mass; so it’s not a gamechanger.
1,@tobyliiiiiiiiii @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight Might just catch the ship with the launch tower; same as booster
1,@ashleevance Battery energy density is the key to electric aircraft. Autonomy for aircraft could have been done a long time ago. Modern airliners are very close to autonomous.
1,@NASASpaceflight Fair point. If autogenous pressurization had been used; CH4 bubbles would most likely have reverted to liquid.   Helium in header was used to prevent ullage collapse from slosh; which happened in prior flight. My fault for approving. Sounded good at the time.
1,@austinbarnard45 SN10 engine was low on thrust due (probably) to partial helium ingestion from fuel header tank. Impact of 10m/s crushed legs &amp; part of skirt. Multiple fixes in work for SN11.

1,@LarryKellogg @arctechinc The Tesla FSD computer started shipping in volume in Q2 2019. 2020 cars should all have FSD computers; whether or not  ordered as an option.
1,Availability varies by region due to regulatory approval delays and/or Tesla internal development &amp; testing.   Note: word “Beta” is used to reduce complacency in usage &amp; set expectations appropriately. All software is first tested internally by Tesla simulation &amp; QA drive teams.
1,Due to high levels of demand for FSD Beta; adding “Download Beta” button to Service section of car display in ~10 days

1,@TheBabylonBee Why don’t we have these already!?
1,Cryptocurrency explained https://t.co/kUXaXx8a1R
1,Or did they say pegged to the dollar? Something like that …
1,Heard a rumor some crypto coin was pegging the dollar 🤣🤣
1,@MIT_CSAIL Machine learning is so amaze!
1,@PPathole @dogecoin Just some used Antminer L3+ rigs bought off eBay. Not really economic; but it was a fun family project.
1,@WholeMarsBlog Most people have no idea; even though there are so many FSD progress videos posted. Munro understood right away.   There will be a gap before the next release; but then it will be a step change better.  Tesla is solving a major real-world AI problem.
1,@dogecoin I just set up some little Doge mining rigs with my kids. It was fun.
1,@PeterSchiff That said; BTC &amp; ETH do seem high lol
1,@PeterSchiff An email saying you have gold is not the same as having gold. You might as well have crypto.  Money is just data that allows us to avoid the inconvenience of barter.  That data; like all data; is subject to latency &amp; error. The system will evolve to that which minimizes both.
1,I just want to start a flame in your heart
1,Just for a day
1,@NASA Congratulations!!
1,@realfuckingnews @business Somehow; a hash text file using ancient crypto can be exchanged for real goods &amp; services!? Amazing.
1,@business To be clear; I am *not* an investor; I am an engineer. I don’t even own any publicly traded stock besides Tesla.   However; when fiat currency has negative real interest; only a fool wouldn’t look elsewhere.   Bitcoin is almost as bs as fiat money. The key word is “almost”.
1,@business Tesla’s action is not directly reflective of my opinion. Having some Bitcoin; which is simply a less dumb form of liquidity than cash; is adventurous enough for an S&amp;P500 company.
1,@Teslarati SpaceX in south Texas &amp; Tesla in central have been providing direct assistance where feasible (eg save cold turtles &amp; help power the water treatment plant). Please let us know if we may be helpful in other ways.
1,.@ERCOT_ISO is not earning that R
1,@MattWallace888 @vladtenev @RobinhoodApp You’re right
1,@Tesla Covered in snow &amp; ice; roads mostly closed &amp; no power in Austin
1,@cz_binance @MansourShahrokh There will definitely be a MarsCoin!
1,@itsALLrisky Sounds like it is
1,@BrennanChant @SpaceX Yeah. Active fairing half recovered though.
1,@rockstardenied @SpaceX SpaceX Boca team is helping save the turtles
1,@ogeNews1 @ShaunStoffer Disturbing concentration
1,@itsALLrisky Absolutely
1,I will literally pay actual $ if they just void their accounts
1,@JaneidyEve Temporarily lower; long-term raise
1,@RationalEtienne An acceptable percentage. Doge is much more concentrated.
1,If major Dogecoin holders sell most of their coins; it will get my full support. Too much concentration is the only real issue imo.
1,@MarcusHouseGame Success on landing probability is ~60% this time
1,.@KremlinRussia_E would you like join me for a conversation on Clubhouse?
1,Lil meme juice for the weekend https://t.co/e9rVtk4SEe
1,@Erdayastronaut Good analysis. We’re working on lowering min throttle of Raptor; so that there is engine redundancy throughout the landing burn.

1,@freewalletorg Your app sucks
1,@BLKMDL3 @RationalEtienne @Adamklotz_ Once we can predict cash flow reasonably well; Starlink will IPO
1,@RationalEtienne @Adamklotz_ Starlink is a staggeringly difficult technical &amp; economic endeavor. However; if we don’t fail; the cost to end users will improve every year.
1,@RationalEtienne @Adamklotz_ SpaceX needs to pass through a deep chasm of negative cash flow over the next year or so to make Starlink financially viable. Every new satellite constellation in history has gone bankrupt. We hope to be the first that does not.
1,@ID_AA_Carmack Lowest cost per ton of carbon sequestered; net of value of any product made.   Must be scalable to gigaton level.  Aiming for maximum usefulness.
1,@Adamklotz_ It’s meant to be the same price in all countries. Only difference should be taxes &amp; shipping.
1,@tobyliiiiiiiiii This is intended for Earth; but there may be some ideas that apply to Mars too
1,XPrize team will manage the $100M carbon capture prize
1,@SRuhle Everyone at Tesla receives stock.   My comp is all stock/options; which I do not take off the table.   That’s what you’re missing.
1,Back to work I go …
1,@CapybaraSurfer @MattWallace888 Does seem a bit high
1,@itsALLrisky Doge appears to be inflationary; but is not meaningfully so (fixed # of coins per unit time); whereas BTC is arguably deflationary to a fault.  Transaction speed of Doge should ideally be a few orders of magnitude faster.
1,@Erdayastronaut @michaelhodapp_ 1. Orbital launch tower that can stack 2. Enough Raptors for orbit booster 3. Improve ship &amp; booster mass
1,@michaelhodapp_ Back to work tonight!

1,@redlineshifter Just a scratch
1,Much wow!
1,@Adamklotz_ @Erdayastronaut @josh_bickett @ajtourville @SpaceX Will still use hot gas maneuvering (RCS) thrusters; as ~5X more efficient than nitrogen (300 sec vs 60 sec Isp)
1,@Erdayastronaut @josh_bickett @ajtourville @SpaceX Higher Isp too
1,@Erdayastronaut @josh_bickett @ajtourville @SpaceX Intuitively; it would seem so; but turbopump-fed Raptors have much higher thrust &amp; propellant mass fraction than pressure-fed gas thrusters &amp; they’re already there
1,@josh_bickett @ajtourville @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Yeah. By default; engine with least lever arm would shut down if all 3 are good.
1,@ajtourville @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Yes; but engines have a min throttle point where there is flameout risk; so landing on 3 engines means high thrust/weight (further away from hover point); which is also risky
1,@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX It was foolish of us not to start 3 engines &amp; immediately shut down 1; as 2 are needed to land

1,@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX @flightclubio Mass of initial SN ships will be a little high &amp; Isp a little low; but; over time; it will be ~150t to LEO fully reusable
1,We have extra FDA-approved ventilators. Will ship to hospitals worldwide within Tesla delivery regions. Device &amp; shipping cost are free. Only requirement is that the vents are needed immediately for patients; not stored in a warehouse. Please me or @Tesla know.
1,@Teslarati @BocaChicaGal The legs extend &amp; telescope out; so are longer than they seem; but not as long as they will be for SN4+
1,@neiltyson One day we will
1,@MarsMeditation @RationalEtienne @PPathole The S-curve appears to be entering the logarithmic phase

1,@teslaownersSV Seeing friends
1,Hello from the Inside https://t.co/SV3fWL3bkp
1,@microdentist And many doctors are not treating patients; due to fear of giving or receiving C19
1,@n2179_twit @AbbottNews This sounds great
1,@AbbottNews Can you do a fast antibody test?
1,Would be great to combine blood donations with a C19 antibody test; so you know if you’re immune. Refill blood banks &amp; give donors peace of mind.
1,@PPathole @VitalVegas Buzzfeed is a mind virus
1,@VitalVegas Also makes for a great shelter https://t.co/f991AJD2mU
1,@AlexSafahi @NYCMayor We will give away all our ventilators; whether we buy them or build them
1,@kshah07 @yosefontwo @JSellMafia @NYCMayor Yes. Just as with groceries; the panic is also causing hoarding of ventilators; preventing them from reaching the hospitals where they are needed.
1,@NYCMayor Biggest value Tesla is providing is precise delivery of ventilators exactly to the ICU where &amp; when they’re needed. There are many ventilators in warehouses; but stuck in logistics/routing/paperwork issues.
1,@NYCMayor You’re most welcome. Credit to the Tesla team. Will do our best to help in any way.
1,@thirdrowtesla Exactly. Douglas Adams knew what he was talking about.
1,@FidelCatsro @AlexBerenson .@mayemusk Care to comment?
1,@teslaownersSV @Teslarati Working on that with Medtronic. Given NY pressing needs; we’re delivering Resmed; Philips &amp; Medtronic ventilators to NY hospitals starting tonight.
1,@MartianDays Physics is the law; everything else is a recommendation
1,@flcnhvy @Tesla Giga New York will reopen for ventilator production as soon as humanly possible. We will do anything in our power to help the citizens of New York.
1,@enscand @PPathole @flcnhvy @Tesla Something weird happened at CDC yesterday. They changed the graph to include “estimated illness onset date”. This is a significantly less rigorous standard. https://t.co/Dz2Nio5ddi
1,@PPathole @flcnhvy @Tesla C19 testing in the US over the past week has grown much faster than C19 positive cases. I think we may have passed the inflection point for US cases (excluding NY) already.
1,@PPathole @flcnhvy @Tesla Yes. Is there more? Should be a lot of data by now.
1,@flcnhvy @Tesla Making good progress. We will do whatever is needed to help in these difficult times.
1,This meme proves it https://t.co/3CHAzxv6dj
1,It’s ducked!
1,@SamTalksTesla @MikeBloomberg True. @MikeBloomberg; this is  accurate. You believe in journalistic integrity; but if something isn’t done; this will continue.
1,@steezyysosa @TesLatino @flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla @MikeBloomberg @Twitter Have let @twitter know
1,@flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla This is messed up @MikeBloomberg
1,@JBNielsen1985 @stephenpallotta @ajtourville @Teslarati Both
1,@InSpaceXItrust @Kristennetten @thirdrowtesla Could maybe tap the condensation for water too. Seems odd that HVAC systems make pure; fresh water &amp; just dump it on the ground.
1,@SteveHamel16 @JordanWells33 @hereforthecom19 @ScottWapnerCNBC Thanks Tesla China team; China Customs Authority &amp; LAX customs for acting so swiftly
1,@SteveHamel16 @JordanWells33 @hereforthecom19 @ScottWapnerCNBC Yup; China had an oversupply; so we bought 1255 FDA-approved ResMed; Philips &amp; Medtronic ventilators on Friday night &amp; airshipped them to LA. If you want a free ventilator installed; please let us know!
1,@Kristennetten @thirdrowtesla Yeah; pretty much. House could talk to car &amp; know when you’re expected home; so temp &amp; humidity would be perfect just as you arrive. No wasted energy.
1,@romn8tr @stephenpallotta @ajtourville @Teslarati This is a way bigger deal than most people realize
1,@stephenpallotta @ajtourville @Teslarati Sure would love to do home hvac that’s quiet &amp; efficient; with humidity control &amp; HEPA filter
1,@ajtourville @Teslarati The heat pump and rear body castings are a step beyond
1,@Teslarati Model Y heat pump is some of the best engineering I’ve seen in a while. Team did next-level work.
1,@BocachicaMaria1 Will do
1,@teslaownersSV @RenataKonkoly @sdunbabin @jonkay @Quillette Most likely; imo; we will see a significant reduction in the confirmed C19 case growth rate this week. Follow chart at bottom of this CDC page: https://t.co/vZ3PbhQihG
1,@RenataKonkoly @sdunbabin @jonkay @Quillette Exactly
1,@jonkay @Quillette According to the Italian govt; only 12% of deaths are actually due to C19. This is a significant policy difference in Italy vs most other countries.
1,@engineers_feed Engineering ftw
1,@flyLAXairport Much appreciated
1,@PPathole @BBCScienceNews Have you seen more data on HCQ &amp; Z-Pak? Hard to find.
1,@BBCScienceNews Worrisome
1,@JohnnaCrider1 @thirdrowtesla We’ll try to get &amp; deliver as many as possible. N95 masks are a pain to wear btw. Less onerous masks are better most of the time.
1,@Kristennetten @thirdrowtesla @SalehCU Yeah. We have a mask shipment stuck at LAX. Hopefully freed up soon.
1,@engineers_feed Nice
1,@JohnCleese This is great advice
1,@uwdrwaldorf @Tesla @omead_a @UWMedicine Thanks for taking delivery in your garage! Let us know if there’s anything else you need.
1,@justpaulinelol @EvaFoxU @Tesla We expect to have over ~1200 to distribute this week. Getting them delivered; installed &amp; operating is the harder part.
1,@EvaFoxU @Tesla Supply chain logistics — getting masks &amp; other PPE to the right places in time  — is the main issue we’re hearing from ER physicians
1,@NativeCACV @Tesla @omead_a You’re most welcome. We’re working on getting other types of PPE too. Ventilators should arrive within a few days.
1,@benikbeno @CDCgov Panic is always dumb
1,@Guruleaks1 @benikbeno Italy: “On re-evaluation by the National Institute of Health; only 12 per cent of death certificates have shown a direct causality from coronavirus.”
1,@CDCgov Close contact family gatherings that mix young kids; who have almost no risk of C19 death; with grandparents who have high risk (especially those with prior lung damage); are one of the most powerful mortality vectors
1,@Jennerator211 We have N95 masks &amp; getting PAPRs. Will have our team reach out.
1,Just had a long engineering discussion with Medtronic about state-of-the-art ventilators. Very impressive team!
1,@SamTalksTesla @flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla @NateSilver538 No problem :)
1,@SamTalksTesla @flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla @NateSilver538 Sigmoid (S-curve) is how all physical and mental viruses behave; regardless of containment. Containment reduces asymptote of S-curve. At this point; we have strict containment in US/Europe &amp; should expect similarly reduced asymptote to China.
1,@flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla @NateSilver538 Sigmoidal for China; followed by sigmoidal for rest of world
1,@Lauren62515251 @PPathole @NateSilver538 Fair point :)
1,@RiccitelliDylan @ColdBuschLights @PPathole @NateSilver538 Exactly; both would be false positive. Also; dying with C19 is different from dying because of C19. Vast majority who died had other illnesses too. https://t.co/YKMW54q2kL
1,@PPathole @NateSilver538 Up to 80% false positive
1,@PPathole @NateSilver538 Sure; although ventilator companies definitely know how to make ventilators. Just a spike in demand right now. Also; using CPAP machines for less severe cases &amp; using one ventilator for several patients seem like good moves to meet short-term demand.
1,@NateSilver538 Do you have data on the false positive rate? I’ve heard a wide range of numbers. CDC numbers are almost an order of magnitude lower between high fidelity data (onset date known) and “presumed positive”. https://t.co/vZ3PbhQihG
1,@friedberg Feels like the plot of Deus Ex https://t.co/R8tmw048JM
1,@MG42bonesaw A single computer; pump &amp; pressure accumulator would be fine for many patients; but ideally individual valves per patient to personalize care &amp; avoid cross-flow risk
1,@RenataKonkoly @moskov Yeah; SpaceX is working on ventilators too
1,@moskov That won’t work for our auto parts suppliers; so; no; our US factory can’t stay open
1,@EdLudlow Yes; we’re working on ventilators; even though I think they probably won’t be needed
1,@alandrummond2 Interesting thread
1,@DOfaquarius @PPathole Thanks 💖
1,@Cernovich China is operating normally across hundreds of suppliers &amp; all of Tesla Shanghai
1,@DOfaquarius @PPathole We’re working on ventilators; even though I think there will not be a shortage by the time we can make enough to matter
1,@flcnhvy Anyone feeling even slightly ill should stay home. Elderly should avoid close contact; even with family members; for now. Those seem most important.
1,@RationalEtienne @PPathole Kids are essentially immune; but elderly with existing conditions are vulnerable. Family gatherings with close contact between kids &amp; grandparents probably most risky.
1,@PPathole Based on current trends; probably close to zero new cases in US too by end of April
1,No new domestic corona cases in China https://t.co/lGmxRvMyFy
1,@westcoastbill Imo; this professor is correct. Also; growth rate of confirmed C19 cases is dropping every day; despite 10X increase in testing. From Tues to today; was 43%; 24%; 17%. Track this chart: https://t.co/vZ3PbhQihG
1,@NYCMayor @NateSilver538 Sounds good; we will connect with your team to understand potential needs
1,@DisruptResearch @Jason True
1,@Jason Exactly. My guess is that the panic will cause more harm than the virus; if that hasn’t happened already.
1,@suhaylabbas @fawadchaudhry We will make ventilators if there is a shortage
1,@cleantechnica Some helpful data from Italy https://t.co/3taxq5NXcZ
1,@cleantechnica Monitor graph at bottom of CDC website. New “confirmed” cases; not oft-reported “presumptive positive” is trending to level off over next few weeks &amp; be negligible by end of April. Same pattern as China.  https://t.co/vZ3PbhQihG
1,@cleantechnica 0% chance of anything close
1,@RiganoESQ @DiderRaoult How does this compare to favipiravir? https://t.co/rM1MqsVsr1
1,@Erdayastronaut @SciGuySpace Last launch aborted due to slightly high power. Possibly; but not obviously; related to today. This vehicle has seen a lot of wear; so today isn’t a big surprise. Life leader rockets are used only for internal missions. Won’t risk non-SpaceX satellites.
1,@KMastersBarnes @SpaceX Yeah; most reflights ever!
1,@SciGuySpace Yeah. There was also an early engine shutdown on ascent; but it didn’t affect orbit insertion. Shows value of having 9 engines! Thorough investigation needed before next mission.
1,Because polygon doesn’t rhyme
1,@annerajb Yeah

1,@nichegamer Seems to be happening a lot
1,@1971capital @MLevitt_NP2013 Very sensible. Knows how to handle exponential functions in reality.
1,@RiganoESQ @DiderRaoult Whether Z-pak works in this situation or not; it’s a kickass med for many maladies https://t.co/UM2TqYpZQZ
1,@mikefthomp If Jamis needs help; he has many friends; me among them
1,@fael097 Pretty close. Design is evolving rapidly. Would be great to flatten domes; embed engines &amp; add ~1.5 barrel sections of propellant for same total length. Also; current legs are a bit too small.
1,Hydroxychloroquine probably better https://t.co/FWn2kh1LZx https://t.co/wQODHiFeWT
1,@PPathole Sounds sensible
1,That said; danger of panic still far exceeds danger of corona imo. If we over-allocate medical resources to corona; it will come at expense of treating other illnesses. Track graph at bottom of this page: https://t.co/7nWKjiZyFn
1,This paper matches what I’m hearing from a lot of smart people https://t.co/vul3xORsgq
1,@PPathole @Sofiaan @RenataKonkoly @meckimac Yeah. Fate loves irony.
1,@Sofiaan @RenataKonkoly @meckimac What’s worse is that I even told Stanford to check me for the $^#* parasite &amp; they still couldn’t find it!
1,@Sofiaan @RenataKonkoly @meckimac Yeah https://t.co/yp3pBn4prV
1,@RenataKonkoly @meckimac I was first misdiagnosed at Stanford Hospital with viral meningitis; then again misdiagnosed at Sequoia. A visiting doc from San Jose General saw my charts &amp; sent me to ICU immediately. I was ~36 hours from being unrecoverable. So; I take expert advice with a grain of salt …
1,@meckimac Was also given a lot of doxycycline https://t.co/hn0BzsIatz
1,@Gundament Maybe helpful
1,@meckimac Yes; I received chloroquine via central line through my chest &amp; both arms. Had near fatal case of falciparum. Would’ve died for sure if not for chloroquine. Doesn’t mean it works for C19; but maybe better than nothing.
1,Maybe worth considering chloroquine for C19 https://t.co/LEYob7Jofr
1,@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX @BoeingSpace @ulalaunch @Boeing Slight booster length increase to 70m; so 120m for whole system. Liftoff mass ~5000 mT.

1,@Techmeme @YunLi626 Market was bit high anyway; so due for a correction
1,@nextspaceflight @Erdayastronaut Static fire &amp; short flights with SN3; longer flights with SN4; but spooling up the whole Starship/Raptor production line is really what matters
1,@Erdayastronaut SN2 (with thrust puck) passed cryo pressure &amp; engine thrust load tests late last night
1,@nypost He studied the blade
1,@EvaFoxU Memes are powerful
1,@PPathole @FxzzOnTheBeat Ships with a lot of people &amp; limited medical facilities are a serious issue
1,@lexfridman Yeah; that’s a great one
1,@FxzzOnTheBeat Fatality rate also greatly overstated. Because there are so few test kits; those who die with respiratory symptoms are tested for C19; but those with minor symptoms are usually not. Prevalence of coronaviruses &amp; other colds in general population is very high!
1,@FxzzOnTheBeat Virality of C19 is overstated due to conflating diagnosis date with contraction date &amp; over-extrapolating exponential growth; which is never what happens in reality. Keep extrapolating &amp; virus will exceed mass of known universe!
1,@War_Remains @HardcoreHistory Thanks for taking us through this today. Hopefully; such horrors will never again be repeated in reality.
1,@cosmicdatabase Yeah
1,Accurate
1,Envelope expanded
1,@Alejandro_DebH Recent missed landing (at sea) was due to incorrect wind data. If this (land) landing fails; it will most likely be for a different reason.

1,The coronavirus panic is dumb
1,@Tesla Raising art to new heights
1,@ChrisDungeon Also; when tech is new; catalog engineering isn’t possible; as there is no catalog. Has to be first principles.
1,@justpaulinelol @Erdayastronaut @Sofiaan @Tesla We’re making progress. Improved rules are going through the EU standards committees. Hopefully better in a few months.
1,@Erdayastronaut @Sofiaan @Tesla Cool; we’re tracking to release more FSD features later this month
1,@Sofiaan @Tesla True. Oddly; those who complained didn’t actually order FSD. Perhaps they weren’t aware that the computer is upgraded for free if the FSD option is ordered even after delivery.
1,Mad respect for the makers of things
1,@Teslarati No matter what; we need to pressurize the production system. Rocket design is relatively easy; making one is hard; making many is extremely hard. Manufacturing is underrated.

1,Just want say that I support @Jack as Twitter CEO. He has a good ❤️.
1,@vincent13031925 Definitely
1,@flcnhvy @JaneidyEve We’re stripping SN2 to bare minimum to test the thrust puck to dome weld under pressure; first with water; then at cryo. Hopefully; ready to test in a few days.
1,@JaneidyEve There’s a puck at the base that takes the engine thrust load. Don’t shuck the puck!

1,@annerajb @RealEmirHan We need to finish work on Autopilot core foundation code &amp; 3D labelling; then functionality will happen quickly. Not long now.
1,@Universe_SkyArt @TwitterSupport I just sent a note to Twitter to clarify that posting SpaceX videos is fine by us and we paid for rights to Bowie song for the Falcon Heavy launch
1,@Teslarati It’s not that big really
1,@SpaceX Testing Raptor in vertical configuration (on the giant tripod) should allow us to simplify some aspects of the engine design
1,@newscientist It’s not mine
1,@Foxfire40900590 Definitely! What’s in that sky city thing!?  Needs a prequel even more than a sequel.
1,@Erdayastronaut @JaneidyEve @JakeTheHuman28 @tesla_truth @Twitter Sure
1,@JaneidyEve @JakeTheHuman28 @tesla_truth @Twitter Posting SpaceX videos is definitely not copyright infringement!
1,@j_brorsson @Teslarati Hopefully; in March. Checking …
1,@Teslarati I had no idea this existed. Sounds awesome though!
1,@RationalEtienne @Bryr32 Full disclosure; I’m actually a 3000 year old vampire. It’s such a trial assuming all these false identities over the centuries!
1,@Bryr32 We had the wrong settings! To make the welds super flat &amp; strong; we’re building a heavy duty; custom planisher; but just having the right settings is a major improvement.

1,Model 3 achieves 350 mile actual range vs 310 EPA sticker in Consumer Reports testing https://t.co/5hqRhjP4bV
1,@PPathole @Erdayastronaut @Teslarati Yes; will also show real-time changes to max acceleration; braking; cornering; speed on gradient &amp; range; latter factoring in route elevation changes &amp; cargo or tow mass &amp; drag impact
1,@Erdayastronaut @Teslarati It’s slightly better
1,@nichegamer Definitely worth trying imo
1,@Teslarati Btw; in some prior tweets I’d said production Cybertruck would be ~80” wide (vs ~84” body width at unveil). This is slightly too small. Will be closer to 82”; but come standard with upper laser blade lights.
1,@Teslarati Active ride height &amp; active damping are game-changing for a truck or any car with a high max/min weight ratio
1,Science has gone too far https://t.co/Ky65Q3s3JX
1,@flcnhvy @SciGuySpace F9 iteration slowed down as payloads became too important to risk. Little change is expected going forward with F9/FH or Dragon. Starship production &amp; thus iterative improvement will be much faster than Falcon. Driving hard for fully reusable orbital flight this year!
1,@PPathole @JohnHanzl It’s mostly to balance the ship during entry. After delivering satellites; the front is light &amp; back is heavy due to engines &amp; landing legs.
1,@JohnHanzl Sorry; meant to say LOX header tank in tip of nose. CH4 main tank is above LOX main.
1,@SciGuySpace These problems are fundamentally intertwined. Building many rockets allows for successive approximation. Progress in any given technology is simply # of iterations * progress between iterations.
1,@SciGuySpace Hardest problem by far is building the production system of something this big. 2nd hardest is achieving full &amp; rapid reuse with payload to orbit of ~2%.
1,@flcnhvy @sydney_ev Probably
1,@sydney_ev Attach wheels to the landing legs &amp; tow Starship to the launch pad
1,@RationalEtienne I rate it two Bugblatter Beasts of Traal up!
1,High bay for stacking Starship engine bay; propellant tanks &amp; fairing (fka nosecone) sections is almost done! https://t.co/G9h0430ns2
1,@pentaquarky @Erdayastronaut The whole nose tip has to have heat shielding for atmospheric entry at Mach 25+ anyway; so is effectively already insulated well in orbit
1,@tobyliiiiiiiiii @Erdayastronaut There will be a common area in the forward section with a big window like this. It will be a lot heavier than steel; but not dangerous. Consider astronauts on the moon with a very thin windowed helmet. They were fine.
1,@Erdayastronaut O2 header tank is tip of nosecone; CH4 header is in the main CH4 tank
1,@tesletter In the order that they were written
1,Worth reading Asimov’s Foundation https://t.co/OZfhcNNzyG
1,@tobyliiiiiiiiii SN 2+ will have better fit &amp; weld quality. Later serial numbers will use bigger stampings; so much less weld length.

1,@_KarenHao @OpenAI OpenAI should be more open imo
1,@vincent13031925 Initially; yes; but then will make sense to localize closer to customers. Pretty much same plan as vehicles.

1,@litgenstein Haha
1,@archillect Sorry; probably going to be a lot of rocket pics from @archillect 🤣🤣
1,@BLKMDL3 @jgrano305 @DMC_Ryan @Jason X will also improve by a similar amount
1,@jgrano305 @BLKMDL3 @DMC_Ryan @Jason Depends on when car was built; as there are many small hardware improvements; so most will be somewhere in between 373 &amp; 390
1,@jgrano305 @DMC_Ryan @Jason Regulations require calling it something else; so we added +
1,@DMC_Ryan @Jason There’s a tough performance vs range tradeoff. Plaid has absurd performance; while holding range roughly constant.
1,@PPathole Software just thinks the car is less efficient than it actually is
1,@PPathole Many small hardware improvements throughout the car that have been introduced gradually over past several months
1,All S/X cars made in recent months have actually been above stated EPA range. Will be unlocked soon for free via software update.
1,Tesla Model S estimated EPA range is now above 390 miles or ~630 km https://t.co/sNFzIkuJpC

1,@Erdayastronaut @robert_zubrin Unfortunately; Starship unlikely to survive LEO entry intact without shielding on windward side; but none required on leeward. Even windward shielding is very light.

1,The degree to which SolarGlass will positively effect the esthetics &amp; energy sustainability of neighborhoods throughout the world is not yet well appreciated. This is a very important product.
1,Tesla April company talk will be from our Giga New York factory; where we make SolarGlass &amp; several other products. Will also offer customer &amp; media tours.
1,Should preface this saying that feedback from early Tesla Solar roof owners has been v positive. It’s stunning vs a regular roof in person imo. Photos don’t do it justice.
1,@brittanygayle98 Its integrated roof &amp; solar; so should be light enough for almost any home
1,@dafuq_mac Coming hopefully later this year
1,@TarunBhatt161 I think will still be better than a normal roof; but adding a heating grid to automatically remove ice &amp; snow sounds like a good option. We have that already on car windows!
1,@_mantis_ Sounds should note that it gets less shiny automatically due to dust &amp; weathering. This pic is brand new.
1,@G_d_Photographr Sounds like we should open a Tesla Center there!
1,Please let us know what improvements we can make to any aspect of Tesla SolarGlass roof! Critical feedback is much appreciated.

1,@JaneidyEve You’re welcome! Was a fun recruiting event. Great to see all the excitement about helping build Starships.
1,@Teslarati @13ericralph31 Unmodified water tower machines do not work well for orbital rockets; as mass efficiency is critical for the latter; but not the former. Hopper; for example; was made of 12.5mm steel vs 4mm for SN1 orbital design. Optimized skins will be &lt;2mm in places across a 9000mm diameter.
1,@nextspaceflight @chraveesh @Teslarati No; they’re SN1. SN2 to follow shortly. Aiming to be a little better each time.
1,@chraveesh @Teslarati Yes; we’re tuning weld parameters to reduce puckering &amp; building a heavy duty planisher to flatten &amp; cold work the weld area
1,@Teslarati That said; although substantial capital &amp; engineering is required to achieve extreme precision; marginal production cost of the primary structure should actually be *less* than a water tower; because it’s built inside a factory in volume.
1,@Teslarati This isn’t quite correct. An orbital rocket needs precision that’s 3X to 4X better than a water tower; so super precise parts; fixtures &amp; welding are needed. Suborbital is much more forgiving.

1,Starship career day at the Stargate building (Boca Chica Blvd; TX) this Thursday from 3pm to 9pm!
1,Going max hardcore on design/production Starship here in Boca. It’s awesome! Feels a bit like a Mars simulator.
1,@justpaulinelol @reto_siegrist @flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla Definitely!
1,@CathieDWood @sbarnettARK @jwangARK @ARKInvest First; we need to make it super safe &amp; easy to use; then determine greatest utility vs risk. From initially working to volume production &amp; implantation is a long road. As with vehicle safety; it will be much harder to pass our internal standards than minimum regulatory standards.
1,@flcnhvy @Tesla @thirdrowtesla Ok sure 😀 Btw; we recruit great engineers from almost anywhere in the world; so this shouldn’t be thought of as USA only. Also; work location can be Bay Area (preferred); but Austin (many of our chip designers are there) or potentially any Tesla Gigafactory.
1,Nothing medically dangerous; but 5g is getting a bit too greedy with their spectrum land grab
1,@TeslaGong @indiealexh @mojosusan @BLKMDL3 @ElonsBrain @CathieDWood @ARKInvest Intuitively; that should be straightforward to address; but there could be complexities I’m unaware of
1,@indiealexh @mojosusan @BLKMDL3 @TeslaGong @ElonsBrain @CathieDWood @ARKInvest True; it has general applications beyond fast; high precision micro-electrode insertion that automatically avoids the vasculature
1,@TeslaGong @ElonsBrain @CathieDWood @ARKInvest It will ultimately be used to make up for entire lost sections of the brain due to stroke/accident/congenital. Don’t want to get too excited; but the potential is truly transformational for restoring brain &amp; motor functions. There is no other way to do it imo.
1,@DOfaquarius @CathieDWood @ARKInvest Wait until you see the next version vs what was presented last year. It’s *awesome*.
1,@ElonsBrain @CathieDWood @ARKInvest Probably this summer
1,@ajtourville @CathieDWood @ARKInvest Yeah; it looks like a medieval torture device; but is nonetheless currently used in many human studies! Not hard to be way better.
1,@PPathole PyTorch is the most frequently used external tool set/library
1,Our NN is initially in Python for rapid iteration; then converted to C++/C/raw metal driver code for speed (important!). Also; tons of C++/C engineers needed for vehicle control &amp; entire rest of car. Educational background is irrelevant; but all must pass hardcore coding test.
1,@CathieDWood @ARKInvest The profound impact of high bandwidth; high precision neural interfaces is underappreciated. Neuralink may have this in a human as soon as this year. Just needs to be unequivocally better than Utah Array; which is already in some humans &amp; has severe drawbacks.
1,@TheReal_Psyche Sorry!
1,@SamTalksTesla A PhD is definitely not required. All that matters is a deep understanding of AI &amp; ability to implement NNs in a way that is actually useful (latter point is what’s truly hard). Don’t care if you even graduated high school.
1,@John_Gardi Not needed; but will be very useful on Mars due to light speed latency
1,Tesla will hold a super fun AI party/hackathon at my house with the Tesla AI/autopilot team in about four weeks. Invitations going out soon.
1,We are (obviously) also looking for world-class chip designers to join our team; based in both Palo Alto &amp; Austin
1,Dojo; our training supercomputer; will be able to process vast amounts of video training data &amp; efficiently run hypersparce arrays with a vast number of parameters; plenty of memory &amp; ultra-high bandwidth between cores. More on this later.
1,Our custom 144 TOPS in-vehicle inference computer; where almost every TOP is useable &amp; optimized for NN; far exceeds anything else in volume production; giving you the hardware you need to run sophisticated nets
1,Tesla will soon have over a million connected vehicles worldwide with sensors &amp; compute needed for full self-driving; which is orders of magnitude more than everyone else combined; giving you the best possible dataset to work with
1,“At Tesla; using AI to solve self-driving isn’t just icing on the cake; it the cake” - @lexfridman   Join AI at Tesla! It reports directly to me &amp; we meet/email/text almost every day. My actions; not just words; show how critically I view (benign) AI.  https://t.co/iF97zvYZRz

1,@marialauraadr @justpaulinelol @nichegamer Haha true
1,@nichegamer @justpaulinelol The safest place to hide a dead body is the second page of Google search results!
1,@nichegamer @justpaulinelol Trolls/bots just need to be deemphasized relative to probable real people who aren’t being paid to push an agenda or scam. Google still shows bs/scam pages; they’re just several clicks away.
1,@justpaulinelol @nichegamer This was a huge problem for search engines until Google applied the citation relevance principle aka PageRank; among many other things https://t.co/qSfqTpfzb2
1,@justpaulinelol @nichegamer Report as soon as you see it. Troll/bot networks on Twitter are a *dire* problem for adversely affecting public discourse &amp; ripping people off. Just dropping their prominence as a function of probable gaming of the system would be a big improvement.

1,@iamyesyouareno Weird
1,💩 posting is now part of my actual job 😂
1,To be clear; I have not done any media interviews and this is not actually my checklist.   I am trying to make life multiplanetary to maximize the probable lifespan of consciousness. Some of the items below are needed for that.
1,Cool 😎
1,@dinkin_flickaa Yeah
1,Seriously.   If you want to know the real answer; it is because almost every one of them; once they become citizens; will vote Democrat.   Criminals vote overwhelmingly Democrat; because they are the soft-on-crime party. This is a fact.
1,@SenRickScott @HSGAC @realDonaldTrump Absolutely
1,There are well over 400 Federal agencies.   I was once in a meeting with a new agency that was being formed; but it didn’t have a name yet.   The reason it didn’t have a name was that all the good acronyms were taken!
1,@Linda_McMahon @A1Policy @America1stWorks Congratulations!

1,@AlecStapp Making GLP inhibitors super affordable seems like it would help in so many ways; but perhaps especially regarding the need for dialysis.   “Just eat healthier” isn’t realistic for most people.

1,@RuiHuang_art Looks awesome
1,@skorusARK @lukepuplett It’s funny how often the reaction to new technology is simultaneously:  1. It would never work.  2. It’s obvious and already being done.   😂
1,Special version of Starship: delete heat shield &amp; flaps; add landing legs.  This could (of course) only be used between trans lunar orbit and lunar surface; given no heat shield or flaps.
1,@SciGuySpace Starship is clearly not causing harm to the local environment; so this is just common sense.   You can’t even tell the difference between a before and after launch photo; except that the rocket is no longer on the launch mount!
1,So many life lessons to be learned from speedrunning video games on max difficulty. Teaches you to see the matrix; rather than simply exist in the matrix.  Diablo Tier 150 finished in under 2 mins.  (That's what she said😂) https://t.co/KYvKm2vIy5

1,@nypost I really enjoy spending time with President @realDonaldTrump. My direct experience is that he is a great guy with an excellent sense of humor. Haven’t seen him do one bad thing even once.  To be clear; while I have offered my opinion on some cabinet candidates; many selections
1,@pmarca JD is his own man; not Peter’s or anyone’s “political bet”
1,@stillgray They will be summoned to the United States of America to explain their censorship and threats to American citizens
1,@MarioNawfal Concerning
1,@matthewdmarsden @BuffyvDarkangel @cenkuygur You are proving your point by identifying the irrationality of the far left
1,@alx Good idea
1,@taraliyah If you disagree with the far left woke cult in any way; you are cast out and viciously attacked.   On the other hand; the so-called “far right” will generally respectfully disagree and hope to persuade you in the future.   Which one is more reasonable?  🇺🇸🇺🇸

1,@BillAckman There are many such situations.   It is utterly psychotic.
1,@LadoBitnar I am highly confident that we can send several uncrewed Starships to Mars in 2 years.  If those ships don’t increment the crater count on Mars; then crewed ships can be sent in 4 years.
1,The biggest technology challenge remaining for Starship is a fully &amp; immediately reusable heat shield.  Being able to land the ship; refill propellant &amp; launch right away with no refurbishment or laborious inspection. That is the acid test.
1,@kwharrison13 @jshieber It would not have been possible for SpaceX to spend so much money effectively. Good chance it would have been counterproductive.
1,Impressive progress in Argentina!
1,@VivekGRamaswamy @DOGE True
1,To the Moon and beyond!
1,Successful ocean landing of Starship!  We will do one more ocean landing of the ship. If that goes well; then SpaceX will attempt to catch the ship with the tower.
1,@howardlutnick Congratulations!
1,8 minutes to liftoff of Starship!  https://t.co/Ngu7VnFsh9
1,Starship will go halfway around the world in ~45 mins
1,@AlexanderSoros I would be curious to meet and understand your goals better

1,@alexisohanian @OffseasonFC Cool
1,@BillboardChris Crazy
1,@JudiciaryDems You’re making a convincing case for Matt Gaetz!! 😂
1,@SciGuySpace @GregWAutry His statement is false
1,@margomartin @realDonaldTrump @SpaceX Should be an exciting day!
1,The chart below is due for an update; but is roughly accurate.   Flight 6 liftoff thrust is ~7500 tons and mass is ~5000 tons.   The tanker version of Starship V3 will weigh over 7000 tons.  By comparison; the heaviest Boeing 747 is less than 500 tons fully loaded.
1,@BrianRoemmele Beautiful
1,@alifarhat79 Phew
1,@BrianRoemmele Awesome
1,A classic 😂  https://t.co/hTWfJJ37Ob

1,@Jaguar Do you sell cars?
1,@cenkuygur Yeah
1,@jgebbia Haha; indeed 😂
1,@AutismCapital Cinnamon Toast Crunch is great
1,It was necessary to increase the probable lifespan of civilization
1,Starbase is an area that experiences storms and hurricanes that are far more serious than Starship launches.   The real headline of this article is boring; because it would say “Starship Launches Cause No Damage” 😂
1,This is so crazy.
1,Stop the Swamp!
1,Far from how the media portrayed him
1,A fully reusable rocket with orbital refilling is the critical breakthrough needed to make life multiplanetary.  For the first time in 4.5 billion years.
1,@visegrad24 Absurd

1,Uh oh 😧
1,Crazy idea: let’s simplify the tax code 🤷‍♂️
1,20 years ago
1,@thebasemint1 Same diameter of 9m (~30 ft); but longer and at least 2 versions.   The propellant tanker version will be especially heavy; as the payload volume in the forward section will mostly contain  propellant.   Thrust goal will be ~10k tons (3X Saturn V) and liftoff mass of tanker
1,@krassenstein Cool 😀
1,@JDVance The cognitive dissonance is a marvel to behold 🤣🤣
1,Current Starship is more than twice as powerful as the Saturn V Moon rocket.  Starship V3; which hopefully flies in about a year; will be 3X more powerful.
1,The objectives for Starship Flight 6 are:  1. Restart of Raptor engines in vacuum. 2. Daylight landing of the ship. 3. Higher peak heating (steeper) reentry. 4. Faster/harder booster catch.   There are thousands of small design changes also being tested.
1,How new taxes start vs how they end
1,The fixed pie fallacy as at the heart of many bad government decisions
1,This is the top of Megabay at Starbase
1,Drop the @DOGE hammer 🔨
1,As for these accusations against him; I consider them worth less than nothing. Under our laws; a man is considered innocent until proven guilty.   If AG Garland (an unprincipled douchebag) could have secured a conviction against Gaetz; he would have; but he knew he could not.
1,Matt Gaetz has 3 critical assets that are needed for the AG role: a big brain; a spine of steel and an axe to grind.   He is the Judge Dredd America needs to clean up a corrupt system and put powerful bad actors in prison.  Gaetz will be our Hammer of Justice.
1,And we will
1,Interesting
1,Starlink is how we are paying for humanity to get to Mars.   That’s why there is a Hohmann transfer orbit diagram on the Starlink router.
1,Moreover; much of the fraud is driven by organized theft rings from other countries; so a lot of it is not even going to American crooks; which is extra galling!
1,That is just the tip of the iceberg.  The actual fraud and waste in government spending is much higher.
1,Yes; the legacy (formerly mainstream) media just literally lied relentlessly
1,This needs to stop

1,Guess not 🤣🤣
1,@GailAlfarATX Cool.   V13 will be another 5 to 10 times better in miles between interventions.
1,Last night with @realDonaldTrump &amp; @JMilei https://t.co/8AjQ8QMAIM
1,True!
1,@SawyerMerritt Yeah
1,I love Gorsuch. RIP PNut 🫡.
1,@PeterSweden7 Good!
1,@TiffanyFong_ 🤣🤣🤣 so true
1,@diana_dukic Making GLP inhibitors available at low cost to Americans who wish to use them would greatly improve health and reduce healthcare costs
1,@ajtourville As anyone who knows Ron would attest.  I never give false praise.
1,@RepThomasMassie @SKMorefield Absolutely
1,@Jason Sounds good to me 😂
1,Great video of Starship Super Heavy Booster landing as seen from Mexico! 🇲🇽   https://t.co/R695MUaicc
1,@ajtourville Exactly
1,@BenjaminNorton So silly
1,@teslaownersSV True
1,They are openly trying to count illegal ballots in Pennsylvania! Unreal …
1,The political party closest to the views of the “moderates” will win. That party is currently the Republicans.
1,This is so true.   Please send https://t.co/bOUOek5Cvy links to friends; so that they know what’s really going on!
1,@ajtourville Ron Baron is a real mensch. I love him.
1,Open dialogue between opposing viewpoints is vital to a healthy democracy
1,@jgebbia Indeed. Thank goodness we have a Constitutional right to freedom of speech 🇺🇸
1,@charliekirk11 Great to hear
1,Getting ready for Starship Flight 6!
1,The UK has become a police state
1,The censorship and advertising boycott cartel must end now!
1,@RadioGenoa Crazy
1,@stillgray Kinzinger is just smelling himself
1,@jaredpolis @RobertKennedyJr Yeah
1,This is the sort of reasoned debate that I like to see on this platform
1,This seems messed up
1,This seems very reasonable
1,@AlecStapp I am pro vaccine; but all medication should be subject to review and improvement
1,There are thousands of examples of taxpayer dollars being wasted. These just a few:
1,@AlexanderSoros The public also believes in his platform and rejected the far left ideology of the current Democratic Party.   If the Democrats become more centrist and shift towards the values and beliefs of the people; they will do better in the future.
1,@AlexanderSoros True
1,@BillAckman @realDonaldTrump 😂😂So true
1,Governing Mars will be up to the Martians; but these are some ideas
1,Interesting
1,@Rothmus This is real?
1,@LKrauss1 Yeah
1,@RepDougCollins @realDonaldTrump Congratulations!
1,@jaredpolis @RobertKennedyJr @HHSGov Cool
1,@FocusProb @cb_doge The magnitude of the waste is beyond what the public could possibly imagine
1,@stillgray Glad to have them back!
1,@argonerd Yikes
1,@MarioNawfal Interesting
1,@AutismCapital @RandPaul @DOGE I am kinda curious as to what the results were 😂
1,@SwipeWright @sciam Yes; put the science back in Scientific American!
1,Congratulations @RobertKennedyJr!
1,@fordnation @Starlink Cool!
1,@Geiger_Capital In my view; we should end all government subsidies; including those for EVs; oil and gas
1,@Rothmus Just do the opposite of whatever Bolton recommends 😂
1,@alx That’s the whole point! 😂
1,@stclairashley Yeah
1,Indeed; this will be tedious work; make lots of enemies &amp; compensation is zero.   What a great deal! 😂
1,@ajtourville @Starlink Cool
1,Hard to believe that things turned out this way
1,True
1,Another batch of Starlinks in orbit
1,Cool
1,Thanks!
1,@amuse Good
1,Super important to send https://t.co/bOUOek5Cvy links to friends to show them what’s really true!
1,Crazy
1,@TheRabbitHole84 😂  And annoying jerks
1,@DefiyantlyFree We have an opportunity to beat the machine
1,As predicted
1,@MarioNawfal Yeah; he’s a huge tool
1,@MikeBenzCyber Seriously
1,@libsoftiktok He should be
1,Exactly
1,@RoyalFamily Happy birthday!
1,@MikeBenzCyber Is that legal?
1,Looks like a lot of opportunity for @DOGE!
1,Another Falcon launch  https://t.co/hrsIMXGxYf
1,That is the goal
1,@diana_dukic Go woke; go broke
1,John Bolton; who is a staggeringly dumb warmonger; being against someone is a great sign!   Gaetz will be great.
1,@JoelWBerry Exactly
1,@Timcast Doesn’t sound like she reflects the view of her constituents
1,Cool
1,Even a brief stint in government by people with high competence and integrity would greatly help America
1,It is the only way to build a large enough city for Mars to be self-sustaining
1,@BillyM2k Correlation is 💯 so far 😂
1,Without rigorous pursuing truth; you obviously cannot understand the true nature of the universe
1,@JohnnaCrider1 Unless we do something about the rapidly rising national debt; America will go bankrupt. This is a severe crisis!  Our interest payments; at almost a quarter of national tax revenue; already exceed our military expenditures and are headed towards absorbing all tax revenue!
1,@Holden_Culotta @RonPaul Yeah; I have to say that cutting this much waste will make a lot of bad people angry.  Will need extra tight security.
1,Douglas Murray is an excellent writer
1,@MikeBenzCyber Indeed. Another dumb Russia hoax 😴
1,@MarioNawfal Sooo … electric helicopters? Still cool.
1,@MarioNawfal This is so crazy!  I was literally at Mar-a-Lago with @Caitlyn_Jenner last week.
1,@tunguz 🎶 @DOGE is coming to town 🎶
1,Crazy
1,@MattWalshBlog Great
1,@TRobinsonNewEra Crazy
1,@HeidiBriones @VivekGRamaswamy We will try very hard!
1,True
1,Starship Flight 6 coming up soon!  https://t.co/WgtLjxsP52
1,Yeah
1,Beautiful movie
1,True https://t.co/ogbH9AHwfi
1,@FoxNews Good
1,@chrismanfrank It is better for people to work at jobs that produce goods &amp; services of higher value than government jobs; which are too often of no or negative value
1,@naval Bullseye
1,@alifarhat79 @LibertyCappy Yeah
1,@LibertyCappy It’s a bit much at this point
1,20 more Starlinks in orbit
1,@WholeMarsBlog It really does work
1,Nature is healing
1,@MarioNawfal Is the borrowing rate really that low?  @CommunityNotes
1,@TeslaBoomerMama @EpochTimes Outstanding
1,@nicksortor Lovely dinner
1,@PU28453638 Much appreciated
1,End tribalism in entertainment!
1,@astupple Rockets don’t get to orbit unless you correct a *lot* of mistakes
1,@longmier @Starlink Almost there
1,@Rothmus Groan
1,This is so awesome 😎 😂
1,@chrismanfrank More accurate would be that I’m “George Soros” of the middle.  I don’t want the pendulum to swing too far right; but right now it’s just too far left.
1,@BaptisteVicini No; it actually was an act of charity.  But we can’t force other companies to make great electric vehicles. That is not within our power.   At SpaceX; we don’t even bother with patents. Copy our rockets if you want.
1,@MarioNawfal Yeah
1,@WallStreetSilv He’s great
1,@ShadowofEzra We will do weekly @DOGE updates via livestream
1,Wild times ahead for rocket launches
1,Good point
1,Seriously   https://t.co/kxcg2Arf8v
1,Amazing 😂  https://t.co/CmDmUFXptP
1,@nypost Unless you lock up career criminals; you will have nonstop crime!
1,The real number is far higher
1,@nima_owji Cool
1,@MarioNawfal True
1,The excess government spending is what causes inflation!   ALL government spending is taxation. This is a very important concept to appreciate.   It is either direct taxation; like income tax; or indirect via inflation due to increasing the money supply.
1,Merrick Garland is not a good person
1,The sheer magnitude of government waste is staggering to behold!
1,True of both parties 😂
1,@BillboardChris Good
1,@MikeBenzCyber @mattgaetz Garland is such a douchebag. At least he is not on the Supreme Court! Phew.
1,@GailAlfarATX He is a very kind man
1,@wlopwangling Beautiful
1,Awesome 😎
1,Keep sending https://t.co/bOUOek5Cvy links to friends so they know what’s actually happening!
1,@stevenmarkryan They are losing their mind 🤣🤣
1,Of course
1,@SawyerMerritt Cool
1,@Rep_Magaziner Swamp creatures like Magaziner will naturally complain when someone wants to drain the swamp.   Expect many such accusations from the guilty.
1,@DebbieHagedorn @MarioNawfal That was a big part of it
1,@MarioNawfal They still don’t understand why they lost all the swing states and key House districts outside of the swing states
1,@ajtourville It’s great
1,True
1,@SenWarren Unlike you; neither of us are being paid; so it is very efficient indeed.  @DOGE will do great things for the American people. Let history be the judge.
1,@Rothmus Yeah
1,@stclairashley Yikes
1,Do these expenditures seem like a good use of your taxes?  https://t.co/itgI9Np2m1
1,@libsoftiktok Awesome 😎
1,@ChrisMacchio @realDonaldTrump @MarALago Beautiful performance
1,@teslaownersSV Thanks :)
1,@DefiyantlyFree Exactly
1,@stclairashley Accurate 😂😂
1,@BillAckman True
1,@TheRabbitHole84 Coming right up!
1,This is awesome beyond words 🤣🤣
1,You are the media now!
1,@TheSubwaySean @AutismCapital I don’t like the esthetics of reposting too much
1,@BillboardChris Yeah
1,The big government machine https://t.co/5QL0b4xRBZ
1,The hidden regulatory cost burden on Americans in immense
1,@RubinReport I kinda hope they keep going for the memes
1,@EvaLovesDesign Amazing
1,@alx That was a huge mistake
1,@glennbeck @realDonaldTrump I’m having an awesome time!  @realDonaldTrump is such a great guy. He really is.   One person after another has told me how kind he has been to them. And that is my direct observation too.
1,@alx True 🤣
1,@stclairashley It is glorious to behold 🤣🤣
1,@diana_dukic @chronicles_o They are losing their minds
1,@diana_dukic That is so funny 🤣🤣
1,@MarioNawfal Amazing 🤩
1,@GadSaad @CBC Exactly
1,@PeterDiamandis It’s not for sure going to be good; but probably 80% likely
1,@Rothmus The Hammer of Justice is coming
1,@Rothmus How else? 🤷‍♂️  There is no other way.
1,@kcoleman Good progress
1,While others partied; Cybertruck studied the blade
1,@PapiTrumpo Based
1,@shayne_coplan Indeed
1,@shaunmmaguire Ginger is cool
1,@stevenmarkryan Bigtime
1,@DonaldJTrumpJr I’m all-in
1,@MarioNawfal Schiff is as dirty as they come
1,Send https://t.co/bOUOek6al6 links to friends so they know what’s really going on!
1,@ElonFactsX High time we exceeded our high-water mark
1,@WesternLensman DC freaking out means we are over the target 😂
1,The absurd regulations get worse every year. Unless we push back; everything will become illegal.
1,@brian_armstrong This seems messed up
1,@realDonaldTrump Congratulations @MarcoRubio!
1,@RepAdamSchiff The Hammer of Justice is coming
1,@EndWokeness She sounds mean
1,The Hammer of Justice is coming
1,@JTLonsdale No more political prosecutions
1,@AutismCapital @TulsiGabbard is great!
1,@TulsiGabbard @realDonaldTrump Congratulations!
1,@mattgaetz Congratulations!
1,It begins
1,@GBNEWS @AllisonPearson @Nigel_Farage This is insane.   Make Orwell Fiction Again!!
1,Takes 5 mins from receiving your @Starlink to it working!
1,@Rothmus Legacy media will continue to decline
1,@Dr_Manhattanx 😂 great question
1,@TexasLindsay_ $10M from Gates … hmm
1,@VivekGRamaswamy 💯probable 😂
1,@Austen True
1,@VivekGRamaswamy True
1,@OmarSAlolama @VivekRammaswamy @zerobureaucracy Thanks!
1,@SenJohnThune Congratulations
1,@levie That was cool
1,@charliekirk11 This is a tragically accurate description
1,@BillyM2k I think the flat inflation of Dogecoin; which means decreasing percentage inflation; is a feature; not a bug
1,@stclairashley @BillyM2k Lmaooo
1,@BillyM2k Oh the irony 😂
1,@WesternLensman Make Orwell Fiction Again!  Guys like this think 1984 is an instruction manual 😂
1,“Government-funded non-governmental organizations” is obviously a contradiction in terms 😂  They are just an illegal arm of the government.
1,The Democratic Party senate candidate in Pennsylvania is trying to change the outcome of the election by counting NON-CITIZEN votes; which is illegal.   That has been their goal all along. They are just flat-out openly doing crime now.
1,@MostlyPeacefull The citizens of America voted overwhelmingly for this
1,@StephenKing Hi Steve!
1,@SethDillon The legacy media is dying
1,Exactly
1,The world is suffering slow strangulation by overregulation. Every year; the noose tightens a little more.   We finally have a mandate to delete the mountain of choking regulations that do not serve the greater good.
1,@ajtourville @Starlink True
1,The “approve cookie” banner is super annoying. It should be removed.
1,@micsolana @PirateWires Actually; I think education will improve
1,It will be done much faster
1,@ajtourville They are a dying publication
1,@pmarca Europe should be massively increasing nuclear power
1,@realDonaldTrump Great
1,@JamesEsses They are a laboriously vile propaganda machine
1,@PeterSweden7 Great!
1,@realDonaldTrump Excellent choice
1,Sure will 🚀🚀🚀
1,@Telegraph They are irrelevant
1,This is the only way
1,@Austen It is soooo crazy!
1,@Austen True
1,Some of this stuff is not merely a waste of money; but outright evil
1,This is unacceptable. Do the people of Italy live in a democracy or does an unelected autocracy make the decisions?
1,This needs to stop
1,Exactly
1,@MarioNawfal Tunnels will be important on Mars
1,This platform is at all-time highs.   You are the media now.
1,Make Orwell Fiction Again!
1,Incentives matter. There should be rewards for wise spending; but those who waste taxpayer funds cannot be allowed to keep doing so without consequences.
1,A weak faker vs the real deal
1,Yeah
1,@robbystarbuck So crazy
1,Congrats @PeteHegseth!
1,@Jason True
1,@BillAckman Perfect
1,The public deserves to know
1,99 Federal agencies is more than enough
1,@TheRabbitHole84 Yes; super urgent
1,It morning in America again!
1,It really is
1,So … what would you say you do here? 😂
1,Progress
1,@SwipeWright So true 😂
1,@BillAckman @VivekGRamaswamy True
1,@MarshaBlackburn Cool
1,Same in government
1,Either we get government efficient or America goes bankrupt.   That’s what it comes down to.  Wish I were wrong; but it’s true.
1,@EndWokeness That program has achieved nothing. Deleted.
1,Definitely not!
1,Cool
1,Your tax dollars at “work” 😂
1,@BillboardChris The entertainment value will be epic
1,Making Government Fun Again!
1,@stclairashley America was saved by a squirrel and a meme coin!
1,All actions of the Department of Government Efficiency will be posted online for maximum transparency.  Anytime the public thinks we are cutting something important or not cutting something wasteful; just let us know!  We will also have a leaderboard for most insanely dumb
1,The people are indeed watching
1,So true!
1,@edwards345 Indeed 😂  This will require generating many anomalies in the matrix.
1,Interesting thread
1,Sure does …
1,@RubinReport People have no idea how much this will move the needle!
1,Threat to democracy?   Nope; threat to BUREAUCRACY!!!
1,@cb_doge True 🤣🤣
1,Department of Government Efficiency   The merch will be 🔥🔥🔥
1,@alx The merch will be amazing
1,The prophecy has been fulfilled
1,Cool!
1,Something wrong with this chart; but I can’t quite figure it out 😂 https://t.co/Fp8wMvioaT
1,@shaunmmaguire Strong picks
1,Lara Trump is genuinely great
1,@charliekirk11 Great choice
1,@Gfilche Cool
1,𝕏 is #1 in Italy!
1,@RichardDawkins I very much disagree with your assessment of Trump. He has been the subject of extreme media propaganda.   He won the hearts and minds of the American people for good reasons.
1,@andst7 Sea Watch is a criminal organization
1,Starship Flight 6 coming up soon
1,@chamath This would help so many kids
1,Congratulations Tesla Powerwall team!  These will make a big difference around the world. With a Powerwall; your home or business has guaranteed continuous power during utility blackouts or brownouts.   Add solar to your roof and/or nearby ground and you can operate off grid.
1,@GadSaad True
1,@PeterSweden7 Time for change
1,@PeterSweden7 They want to go somewhere where they can still lie and not be corrected
1,@alx Good idea
1,@DonaldJTrumpJr Still much work to do; but the tide of the battle has turned
1,@GuntherEagleman @CollinRugg True
1,@kevinnbass She is an extinctionist
1,“Scientific” American needs a change in management
1,Solar power will be the vast majority of power generation in the future
1,@realDailyTrite @nypost Yeah
1,@SethDillon @nypost Seriously 😐
1,@RandPaul Wow; this is insane
1,@Austen They are subtarded
1,Becoming multiplanetary will greatly increase the lifespan of our civilization and it is the critical next step to becoming multistellar
1,The latter
1,@DefiyantlyFree Yeah
1,Trust in the legacy media is rightfully at an all-time low and declining.   Send https://t.co/bOUOek5Cvy links to friends; especially of actual source material; so that they know the truth of what’s going on.
1,@MikeBenzCyber Good question
1,Nonstop rocket launches!
1,Exactly right
1,Absolutely!
1,Should your tax dollars really be paying for an organization run by people who think the truth is a “distraction”?
1,@LKrauss1 I think so
1,@WesternLensman As that chart shows; nobody takes the lying legacy media seriously anymore. They are a 🤡 show 😂
1,@SwipeWright Yeah
1,Very telling
1,@DeAngelisCorey True
1,@NASASpaceflight Flight 6 is coming soon
1,@ElonFactsX That is what it is
1,@DefiyantlyFree Great idea
1,Any activist judge being pushed through by Pocahontas is bad for the country
1,@PrimeXAI @america Exactly
1,@RobertMSterling The trend to extinction
1,@allanldsantos @america I’m open to the idea
1,@DefiyantlyFree My pronouns are still prosecute/Fauci
1,And; of course; play a significant role in primaries.
1,Normally; PACs go somewhat dormant after a big election.  @America PAC is going to do the opposite and keep grinding; increasing Republican registrations in key districts around the country; in preparation for special elections and the midterms.
1,@chrissgardner Frankly; it was only on the Thursday before the Saturday that ANY of the sketches generated laughs. I was worried.   I was like damn my SNL appearance is going to be so fucking unfunny that it will make a crackhead sober!!  But then it worked out in the end 😮‍💨
1,@DefiyantlyFree Does seem odd
1,@GadSaad @realDonaldTrump Indeed. Phew.
1,@MxHedroom @GadSaad Trump broke his brain
1,@GadSaad Yeah
1,@DefiyantlyFree Yeah
1,@ProgressingCali @stclairashley Yeah
1,@KonstantinKisin His Dad sounds awesome
1,@DefiyantlyFree Busted 🤷‍♂️
1,@BillyM2k @Grummz Exactly
1,@TheRabbitHole84 The computers are deciding our mating patterns 🤔
1,Interesting  https://t.co/61G9RKibAY
1,@ajtourville @Starlink Cool
1,@MikeBenzCyber Global censorship center is shutting down ✌️
1,@iAnonPatriot Pricey
1,@levie They can’t help it 😂
1,@alx Interesting
1,@howardlutnick Very productive day of work by the transition team
1,@MarioNawfal These judges need to go
1,@AutismCapital Good times
1,More Starlinks
1,@Cernovich Sam is subtarded 😂
1,@Cernovich Sam Harris is an utter idiot
1,@Plandemic3Movie Wow; that sure is a scary alliance 🤣🤣
1,@DefiyantlyFree Does seem odd
1,@isabelleboemeke Reactors should be way bigger imo
1,@MarioNawfal I’m happy to be first buddy! 😂
1,@ajtourville It’s way too small though. Needs to be at least twice the size.
1,@ajtourville Looks familiar 😂
1,@ajtourville They are subtarded.   A string of satellites increases bandwidth; not latency.
1,@JonErlichman Wild
1,Starlink now available in Chad!
1,@TheRabbitHole84 Yeah
1,Government Efficiency FTW!!
1,@DavidDeutschOxf True
1,Good idea  https://t.co/AiBnhUwp8U
1,Not exactly great value for money! https://t.co/i9jcpIWfnZ
1,@charliekirk11 Absolutely
1,@sriramk @Scobleizer @nxthompson Wired is a dead publication
1,Exactly
1,@amuse This is crazy
1,@Rothmus Yeah
1,The new Senate Majority Leader must respond to the will of the people
1,@teslaownersSV You will not find a better friend than me; nor a worse enemy
1,Use Grok for answers that are based on up-to-date info!
1,Congratulations @RealTomHoman on being given responsibility for enforcing our borders!
1,@charliekirk11 @RealTomHoman is BASED
1,@amuse Elise is awesome; but it might be too dicey to lose her from the House; at least for now
1,Indeed; the obstacles are overcoming the Kafkaesque nature of the rules governing this vast bureaucracy and ensuring that maniacally dedicated small-government revolutionaries join this administration!
1,@KaiTrumpGolfs Lil X is being such a troll 😂
1,Absolutely! Would be interesting to hear recommendations for roles in the new administration for consideration by the President.
1,@BillyM2k Wow; I don’t even want to look at mine 😂
1,Great!
1,Happy birthday!
1,@DimaZeniuk Faster
1,Perfectly articulated
1,Occupy Mars!
1,The general public is on 𝕏
1,@spacesudoer @KathyLueders We will be much faster than that
1,@jasondebolt True
1,This would be cool 🇺🇸🚀❤️
1,@DillonLoomis22 Yeah
1,True
1,@howardlutnick It is the only way
1,@MarcMerrill Cool
1,Rick Scott for Senate Majority Leader!
1,𝕏 predicted the election outcome; because it represents America
1,Exactly!  I have great respect for the American people; who saw through the relentless propaganda and voted for change.
1,@realDonaldTrump This is essential. There is no other way.
1,Without recess appointments; it will take two years or more to confirm the new administration!   This would make it impossible to enact the change demanded by the American people; which is utterly unacceptable.
1,(Republican) Senator Thune is the top choice of Democrats 🤣🤣
1,@WesternLensman Exactly
1,@the_boring_dad @sriramk Yeah
1,@PeterSweden7 I hope they attack me more
1,𝕏 is back to being #1 in Brazil!
1,@Caitlyn_Jenner True
1,@amuse Dana Carvey just sounds like Dana Carvey
1,Yeah
1,@stormrobinson Send them a link to the source material on https://t.co/bOUOek6al6; like the actual speech given by @realDonaldTrump
1,Must be a coincidence 🙄 https://t.co/npsMqqatx0
1,@america True
1,@alx @nbcsnl They are so mad that @realDonaldTrump won 🤣🤣
1,Who should be Senate Majority Leader?
1,Essential to stop fraud in elections
1,They did and they will get it
1,Exactly
1,Couldn’t agree more
1,@clairlemon Yeah
1,From impossible to late
1,@TheRabbitHole84 Canada is dying
1,@DefiyantlyFree SNL has been dying slowly for years; as they become increasingly out of touch with reality.  Their last-ditch effort to cheat the equal airtime requirements and prop up Kamala before the election only helped sink her campaign further. @nbcsnl
1,@naval Yeah
1,True.   Send them https://t.co/bOUOek6al6 to debunk the hoaxes pushed by the legacy media.
1,@omni_american Yes; and it would have become far worse
1,@MarioNawfal No way to solve speed of light latency; but we can solve for super high bandwidth
1,@jasondebolt She is a far left activist pretending to be a judge
1,@charliekirk11 Yeah
1,You are the media now
1,@NPCliberator @Rothmus That would make a big difference
1,@mchmr96 @MickeySteamboat @AdamLowisz @Chesschick01 Good idea
1,Great rebuttal
1,@stclairashley True
1,This debt growth is unsustainable
1,@JohnCornyn That is encouraging
1,@Rothmus Almost all
1,You are the media now https://t.co/gcTz2DN0P0
1,@visegrad24 He won’t be in power for much longer
1,@CollinRugg That’s what happens when teachers lie to kids. Trump has been clear that he will veto a national abortion ban.
1,@GadSaad Their feedback loop is disconnected from reality. If they were on this platform; they would be more likely to understand.
1,@stevenmarkryan This will be next-level
1,@AlecStapp So many crazy regulations that aren’t in the public interest
1,@robbystarbuck I am encouraged by the discussion so far regarding the key members of the new administration
1,@TuckerCarlson @alppouch The fun police fear that someone somewhere is having a good time and they’re going stop it! 🤣🤣
1,Fidias has a good point
1,It’s crazy
1,It is the only way to understand the universe
1,The unelected and unconstitutional Federal bureaucracy currently has more power than the presidency; legislature or judiciary!  This needs to change.
1,@GadSaad That was a close one
1,@TheRabbitHole84 True
1,@stclairashley Great idea
1,@fentasyl It absolutely demands a thorough investigation
1,@pmarca Interesting
1,@RandPaul @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson @BasedMikeLee Excess government spending is driving America into bankruptcy
1,@ELuttwak Interesting
1,@StephenKing Why do you hate America? That’s messed up.
1,@kevinnbass Seriously
1,@SethDillon Yeah
1,@robbystarbuck Great name
1,@kimbal @thekitchen @exploreatx_ Congrats!!
1,@TheRabbitHole84 They want legacy media to continue to deceive the people of Australia; just as they were deceived about @realDonaldTrump
1,@ToscaMusk @Wise1Philosophy Love you 🥰
1,@TheRabbitHole84 Such intolerance!
1,@ID_AA_Carmack A long chain of modified future generation Starlink satellites between 1 and 1.5 AU would do it
1,Try out the @xAI API!
1,@westcoastbill True!
1,@DeAngelisCorey Wow; this guy is super racist
1,@fentasyl Not for long
1,Yeah
1,@cb_doge True
1,Grok can explain memes
1,I asked Grok to generate an image of The View 😂 https://t.co/UIX2L47Sgv
1,Of Course I Still Love You
1,@amuse Yeah
1,@MarioNawfal @joerogan Cool
1,I was just reading 𝕏 and combining that with real-time swing state voting data sent to me by my @America PAC team
1,You can upload any image to Grok; including medical imaging and get its (non-doctor) opinion.   Grok accurately diagnosed a friend of mine from his scans.
1,That is why
1,@amuse There were an encouraging number of Trump/Vance signs around Austin
1,@ArthurMacwaters @ajtourville A weekly email of accomplishments seems like it should be mandatory for all government employees
1,@stclairashley Yeah
1,Washington DC swamp creatures trying to join the @realDonaldTrump administration right now 🤣🤣 https://t.co/K3vJ6byDwy
1,@Chesschick01 Exactly
1,A launch a day keeps the … away
1,That’s not easy 🤣
1,@pmarca He never not misses
1,@sriramk @markpinc Same 😂
1,The real loser was not the puppet; but rather the big government machine behind the puppet https://t.co/QWhzI2kamT
1,@AutismCapital Does sound cool
1,@AutismCapital Mental illness is a tragedy
1,@MeredithMarsha1 @stillgray Yeah
1,@Tim_Denning Naval is based
1,Embarrassingly slow vote counting in California; where requiring voter ID was recently made illegal …  That said; almost 40% of California voted for @realDonaldTrump.
1,@DimaZeniuk It’s true
1,That would be much appreciated
1,@DimaZeniuk Yeah
1,True
1,@kevinnbass Mental illness
1,Interesting
1,@philthatremains @peterboghossian Yeah
1,@Rothmus True
1,@SleepMoneyMaker @APompliano Yeah
1,@TheRabbitHole84 It’s crazy and unfair
1,Yeah
1,@BasedMikeLee @JDVance Interesting
1,@cerebralblonde @AutismCapital Oprah was paid $1M? Hmm
1,@pmarca Yeah
1,@Texas_jeep__guy True!
1,@TRHLofficial Yup; it’s there for sure 😂
1,@ryanjaycowan @farzyness They’ve been programmed that way by the propaganda in the legacy media.   Send them https://t.co/bOUOek6al6 links so they know the truth.
1,@TheRabbitHole84 Lol; no
1,Working on it
1,@farzyness America has benefited from an influx of very talented Iranians
1,@TheRabbitHole84 Yeah
1,@MostlyPeacefull So true
1,Interesting
1,Troubling
1,@stevenmarkryan The times they are a-changin’
1,@BasedMikeLee Interesting
1,@realDailyWire Wow; this is crazy
1,Yeah!
1,The problem is that she places political activism above science
1,You are the media now
1,@SteveGuest @joerogan @jordanbpeterson He should consider TRT
1,You are the media now
1,True
1,The Norwegian media lied to their people.   They should join 𝕏 to know the truth.   Please send https://t.co/bOUOek6al6 links to your friends.
1,@TheAlexStrenger @TheMeanShowOnX @marycatedelvey You should get an Oscar for that 🤣🤣
1,@jaritacco @MarioNawfal Exactly
1,Exactly
1,@Rothmus Damn; she would be a buzzkill at parties 😮‍💨 🤣🤣🤣🤣
1,Their propaganda isn’t even consistent 😂
1,@MarioNawfal They should at least get a thesaurus
1,@Rothmus Lib therapists are rolling in💰this week 😂
1,@Jim_Jordan @RepLoudermilk Jack Smith’s abuse of the justice system cannot go unpunished
1,@JudiciaryGOP @OversightAdmn Indeed; that was an incredibly improper prosecution
1,@Rothmus Science
1,@MarioNawfal Accurate
1,@MaryTilesTexas Yeah; it’s crazy
1,@StephenKing How’s your week going?
1,@alx He is easily distracted by snacks.   Just put some donuts on the table and make sure he doesn’t knock you over on his way to eat them.
1,You; the individual; are the media now
1,The legacy media lied to you  https://t.co/TuylN2IqYi
1,The legacy media wants to destroy your right to freedom of speech.  They are saying it out loud and repeatedly.
1,@iAnonPatriot He needs TRT; since his balls clearly don’t work 😂
1,@CollinRugg @America PAC utterly crushed them in the swing states ground game and they still don’t realize it 😂
1,@sellthedip6 @ajtourville @UAW The last two guys who ran the UAW went to prison for stealing money from the union members they’re supposed to represent
1,Community Notes 🙌
1,Great summary edit of my conversation with @JoeRogan   https://t.co/Y2yG503Du8
1,@garrytan Things are looking better for California and San Francisco; thanks to your efforts and those of many Californians who are sick of legalized theft and violent streets!
1,@kerrikgray @EndWokeness He is one of the best humans
1,@SethDillon Pathetic
1,@MarioNawfal The senseless killing will end soon.   Time is up for the warmonger profiteers.
1,This is just a very basic first step.   Earth and Mars will ultimately need &gt;petabit/sec connectivity.
1,@shaunmmaguire Incentives drive behavior
1,@EndWokeness This is such bs. Joe Rogan is a great human being and everyone knows it!  That’s why he has a vastly bigger audience than MSNBC; which peddles puerile propaganda.
1,@ILA_NewsX Sowell was brilliant
1,@Travis_4_Trump Yeah; they lost their minds when a single bus load of illegals was sent there; but have no empathy at all for small towns in the Midwest that are deluged with tens of thousands of illegals
1,@shaunmmaguire Yeah
1,@MarioNawfal Most importantly; American taxpayer money will be spent far more effectively and for projects that are truly inspiring
1,Government handouts at the national and state level enable illegals who come here to have a standard of living that is better than half of Earth.   This creates a forcing function for half of Earth to move here.  They will do so; unless the border is secure.   QED.
1,@ajtourville @Starlink They don’t want competition; but competition is good for the people; as it results in better products and services.
1,Let’s push https://t.co/bOUOek6al6 to #1 in Norway!
1,@levie I agree
1,Susie Wiles is great https://t.co/h56f2LIn6d
1,@AutismCapital Thank goodness
1,@shaunmmaguire @sequoia @X It will work out well
1,@ajtourville It’s gonna be 🤩
1,Much appreciated!
1,@teslaownersSV Yeah
1,@Thompsonklay @elon_docs Exactly
1,News by the people; for the people!

1,@ElonFactsX True
1,@jasondebolt Riots require getting off the couch
1,@farzyness High DJT percentage!
1,@FischerKing64 Exactly

1,@BigImpactHumans True
1,@The_Kyle_Mann Seriously … the dots aren’t that hard to connect!
1,Exactly
1,@GuntherEagleman This is the way
1,@Caitlyn_Jenner Sure sounds like he wants to subvert the will of the people!
1,@stclairashley @ProgressLibs @RealMayaLuna Charming
1,@JohnFetterman Calling Green voters “dipshits” is not a great way to win them over
1,@DefiyantlyFree He won’t deport his illegal voters unless he is forced to do so
1,@ns123abc @ylecun Yann is just fully an idiot
1,@ID_AA_Carmack Well; Optimus is already doing some tasks in the factory and the scope of its ability is increasing rapidly.   The toughest part by far is improving the design of Optimus for ease of manufacturing and tooling up a complex supply chain; so it can be made in significant numbers.
1,@pmarca Marc is awesome. All’s well that ends well!
1,@crit_architect @BillyM2k 💯  People should be able to walk around their city without being assaulted!
1,@ScotsFyre @mikeallen @axios @JimVandeHei If I’m so powerful; why does my back still hurt so much!? Sigh.
1,@ScotsFyre @mikeallen @axios @JimVandeHei Yeah
1,That would just cause Democrats to lose even more than they already have; since they way outspend Republicans.   And they have almost all of legacy media and social media on their side!
1,Sounds pretty bad
1,Wow; electricity prices are crazy high in the UK and Europe!
1,In a properly functioning democracy; the people should get what the people want!
1,@Rothmus Haha
1,America’s A team is usually building companies in the private sector   Once in a long time; reforming government is important enough that the A team allocates time to government.   This is that time.
1,❤️🚀🇺🇸 Woohoo LFG!!! 🇺🇸🚀❤️
1,@stillgray @nypost The woke mind virus killed my son
1,Wow; this is crazy!
1,@naval Yeah
1,#1 News App in Canada!
1,@DefiyantlyFree Weird
1,@TheRabbitHole84 Exactly
1,When there are egregiously wrong legal judgments in a single state that substantially harm American citizens in all other 49 states; the Federal government should take immediate corrective action
1,CCDH should be prosecuted for interference in US elections by a foreign entity; among their many crimes
1,@RonningJ He will be gone in the upcoming election
1,Worth showing this again. You can see the mind virus spread rapidly; just like a physical virus.
1,@PeterSweden7 Major housecleaning is needed
1,The New York Times is pure propaganda
1,True; that is encouraging to see 💫
1,@amasad Very sensible
1,@isabelleboemeke Even 10 new reactors in America would be great
1,@TrudgingSoul @GadSaad It’s now ok to state your political views
1,@NikoWrex Yeah
1,@BasedMikeLee Absolutely
1,@Chesschick01 So soothing
1,Yup.   Something is seriously wrong with our “elite” colleges.
1,@WallStreetSilv Thanks
1,Justice prevails.   Meanwhile; none of the many short sellers who egregiously manipulated Tesla stock for years and lied repeatedly on TV have been prosecuted. Not one.
1,Absolutely
1,They say red light helps you sleep better https://t.co/XvVFnmcF9O
1,@TheGlobal_Index The others were sitting on yachts sipping cocktails; while I was giving talks on the ground in Pennsylvania.   Turns out; people find the latter to be far more persuasive …
1,@jasondebolt 💯  Many PhDs have the Ego/Abilty&gt;&gt;1 problem; so weak feedback loop.
1,@Breaking911 Those high-strung harpies must have taken at least 3 hits of Xanax on election night 😂
1,@jk_rowling JCO is a bit of an extinctionist
1,@Rothmus Someone should tell her that there is a cure for Toxoplasmosis
1,Starship is now more than twice as powerful as the Saturn V Moon rocket and; in a year or so; it will be three times as powerful at 10;000 metric tons of thrust.  More importantly; it is designed to be fully reusable; burning ~80% liquid oxygen and ~20% liquid methane (very low
1,@wideawake_media Kimmel is an insufferable nonsense propaganda puppet
1,@RichardDawkins That’s a major factor
1,@3DancingMaidens @TaraBull808 @realDonaldTrump Yeah
1,@Catheri24117613 @GadSaad @realDonaldTrump Absolutely
1,Academia and some “think tanks” are the origin of the extinctionist mind viruses
1,@ajtourville @Starlink Promising
1,Worth noting that far more “billionaires” backed Harris than Trump and she raised almost 50% more money.  Nonetheless; America showed that elections aren’t just a function of money and gave Trump a resounding victory!
1,@SwipeWright Yeah
1,True
1,@pmarca Yeah
1,@shaunmmaguire Yeah
1,@elon_docs Play to win or don’t play at all
1,@YourAnonNews Change your handle to @YourLibtardNews. It’s more accurate.
1,@nicksortor Interesting thread
1,@nic__carter Guess they’ll have to dismantle that gulag they were building for me 🤣🤣
1,@naval Since the dawn of civilization
1,@andrewmichaelio @naval Republicans are the centrist party that wants to restore freedom to the people; have a merit-based society; secure the border and put dangerous criminals in prison.   This was the Democratic Party platform not that long ago.
1,@StephenM @realDonaldTrump The American people have made it absolutely clear that they utterly reject the current ruling class.   Radical reform of government is what they want.
1,@AutismCapital Barron is great
1,Propaganda is far less effective when there is a real-time source of truth on 𝕏
1,For anyone; whether in America or other countries; who finds this result shocking; they should reconsider where they get their information.   This trend was obvious on 𝕏 for months; but almost all the legacy mainstream media pushed a completely false reality.  They lied to you.
1,@markpinc This is nuts. Schools are pushing radical leftist ideology on students instead of actually teaching them things!
1,Arizona just declared for @realDonaldTrump; making it a clean sweep of all swing states!  Massive red wave success! It is beyond a landslide; as Republicans won:  – Presidency – Popular vote – Senate majority – House majority – State governor majority – State legislature majority
1,@VampishBeef @Rothmus Massive red wave
1,@Sentdex Cool
1,@stevenmarkryan Interesting idea
1,@lexfridman It’s gonna be great 💫
1,@KarluskaP Woohoo 🇺🇸🇺🇸
1,I agree!
1,@ZubyMusic Thank you for speaking truth at great risk

1,@nicksortor Awesome
1,@ColtFrank5 @stevenmarkryan That would genuinely be amazing
1,@charliekirk11 Those are great
1,@DefiyantlyFree Nobody cares. Nails on a chalkboard are preferable to hearing Maddow talk.
1,@alexandrosM Good advice
1,@greg_price11 @TrumpWarRoom @TeamTrump @RealDylanMO @jacobkschneider Great work!
1,@RealKidPoker @TulsiGabbard @RobertKennedyJr Exactly
1,Given the unequivocal mandate given to @realDonaldTrump from the people of America; winning not just the electoral college by a landslide; but also the popular vote; Senate AND House; there will be none of that nonsense this time.   They won’t even try.
1,@TheRabbitHole84 Absolutely
1,@Thib_DP Must be absolute propaganda that people are getting in Europe.   X is the antidote!
1,@farzyness Crazy
1,@farzyness @SawyerMerritt Radical reform of government is coming that will end stifling bureaucracy; insane deficit spending and return individual freedoms to the people
1,@Rothmus That would be so next-level awesome
1,@DouglasKMurray It was epic
1,@Stefan3334 @stclairashley They really don’t
1,@cb_doge @alx Lil X gets the vibe 🔥🔥  Out of nowhere several weeks ago; he said “Dad; we have to help Trump!”.
1,@cb_doge Exactly.   Also; if you count total real people with X accounts; including those who only check in during major world events; the number is closer to 1 billion.
1,@PeterSweden7 Wow; that shows what level of propaganda they are being fed!
1,@shellenberger Indeed
1,Accurate assessment
1,@Rob_2628 @JoshuaDReynolds 😂  That’s because too many people in Germany believe the legacy media.   They should use this platform to find out what’s really going on.
1,@Rob_2628 The people of Europe want change!
1,@Liv_Boeree Exactly
1,Huge thank you to everyone who supported this platform and our mutual quest to support freedom of speech!
1,@SebastianThrun Thank goodness!
1,@ajassy @realDonaldTrump Indeed
1,@krassenstein I agree
1,@shellenberger They really don’t get it
1,@sundarpichai @realDonaldTrump Cool
1,@shaunmmaguire Yeah
1,@shaunmmaguire @lindayaX @X Indeed
1,@ChrisJBakke 😂   I love @JoeRogan. He is a mensch.
1,@micsolana Yeah
1,@TheRabbitHole84 America one of the least racist nations on Earth! Definitely; the least so of any large country.
1,@ajtourville @SpaceX This is now possible
1,@benshapiro If you think of a country like a pro sports team that wants to win the championship; which is the right model in general; a good coach makes sure that the best players can play their best game
1,News should come from the people.   From those actually on the scene and those who actually are subject-matter experts!
1,@ScottPresler Thanks Scott!
1,The reality of this election was plain to see on 𝕏; while most legacy media lied relentlessly to the public.   You are the media now.   Please post your thoughts &amp; observations on 𝕏; correct others when wrong and we will have at least one place in the world where you can come
1,@DogecoinNorway I kept meaning to go to sleep; but this app kept dragging me back to wake 😂
1,@LKrauss1 Efficient spending on things that matter to the public (which includes furthering our understanding of the Universe) is the goal

1,@shaunmmaguire NYT sucks. Years ago; I read it all the time. Now; I never do.
1,@jackfarrington @stclairashley @BillyM2k The Californians I know who moved to Texas are even extra Texan marinated in Texas sauce. For the love of God; please don’t let Texas become California 🙏
1,@BillyM2k @stclairashley Yeah; it’s not a money problem at all
1,@YunTaTsai1 Player of Games is a great book
1,@Polymarket It was inevitable
1,@Rothmus He really is
1,@stevenmarkryan Nope
1,The future is gonna be fantastic https://t.co/I46tFsHxs3
1,The people of America gave @realDonaldTrump a crystal clear mandate for change tonight
1,@MikeBenzCyber This outcome was highly likely; given the 2024 early vote numbers vs 2020
1,You are the media now

1,@farzyness Yeah
1,@stevenmarkryan Yeah
1,Sure it was a lot of pressure; but it pales by comparison with President @realDonaldTrump; who they tried to kill twice; bankrupt and imprison for eternity
1,America is a nation of builders Soon; you will be free to build
1,@alx We will free the giant that is America.   Too long; it has been tied down; like Gulliver; with millions of little strings.
1,@stevenmarkryan True
1,@AOC The reality is that an enormous number of sensible; smart women voted for @realDonaldTrump. He would not have won without them.
1,Exactly
1,@farzyness Yeah
1,@EdKrassen This is the way
1,@Austen So lit
1,@ElonFactsX I think so
1,@lexfridman Long-form podcasts are by far the best way for people to understand candidates

1,@ShadowofEzra According to my @America PAC team; this is on track to be solved
1,Thanks for the clarification
1,@Rob_2628 Major buffs to the other classes would be good.   Should be possible for perfectly geared; max level characters of all classes to clear T150 with good gameplay and right mobs/map.

1,What today’s election feels like!  🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸Team America 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 https://t.co/uwlscqDzMz
1,@cb_doge That was priority #1.   Democrat vs Republican early voting in Pennsylvania was better for Dems than 2020 until just after 10/10.  Then a series of things happened that dramatically changed the picture to where Dems are now ~600k votes worse than 2020 going into election day. https://t.co/hxTD0p1NMW
1,@dkardonsky_ Of course
1,And let us strive for ever greater heights!
1,@farzyness I know it’s sacrilege 😂  But; honestly; slices of beef sautéed in a pepper sauce are 🔥🔥
1,@Geiger_Capital Yeah
1,@Austen I switched by breakfast steak to medium-well sautéed in strips. It’s amazing.  TBone or filet medium-rare with a warm center is what I usually have at a restaurant.
1,The cavalry has arrived.  Men are voting in record numbers.   They now realize everything is at stake.
1,This is a massive sea change
1,@ajtourville @SpaceX Yeah
1,@alexsalvinews These voting machines have terrible reliability
1,Test drive a Tesla and see for yourself!
1,@benshapiro Good chance NH goes red
1,@MarioNawfal Literally
1,Send https://t.co/bOUOek5Cvy links to your friends so that they know what’s really going on
1,The legacy media hope that a hoax a day keeps DJT away. It won’t work.
1,@micsolana For sure
1,@ElonFactsX I’m still sad about a harmless pet squirrel &amp; racoon being executed by the government
1,@stillgray Can’t believe that this is actually happening in Britain!
1,@SciGuySpace Strange that no one has copied SpaceX after all this time
1,@naval @PidgeonTrades Yeah
1,@stillgray Yeah
1,@TheHoleTweet Pretty accurate 😂
1,Congrats @SpaceX on the 400th launch!
1,Below are the R minus D early vote deltas in swing states before tomorrow.   Republican turnout on election day is usually much higher than Democrat; so any state currently leaning R in early voting is very likely to side with Trump.  Pennsylvania; while still leaning D; has a https://t.co/1RziVhte02

1,@JohnBasham @willchamberlain @america @TPAction_ They are part of our coalition
1,@willchamberlain The @America PAC team and partner orgs have put immense effort into the Republican ground game.   If there was ever a better executed Republican ground game; I would like to learn from it.
1,@Jason Same
1,@DavidSacks @willchamberlain @megynkelly Would be great to have Megyn in some capacity in the new administration
1,Great speech by @MegynKelly!

1,Yeah
1,@Thompsonklay @AutismCapital Make Orwell Fiction Again!
1,@Rob_2628 1:59 is insanely fast. People have no idea how difficult that is.

1,@stillgray Warlock shield activated! 😂
1,@Geiger_Capital New Hampshire is naturally pro Trump imo.   Live free or die.
1,@AutismCapital Yeah
1,@SimonSaysKnow @stevenmackeyman @eyeslasho True 😂
1,@LeedsExplore @cb_doge @oskararnarson Yeah
1,The only reason to ban voter ID is to make fraud impossible to prove
1,@Thompsonklay @elon_docs Just one
1,@Kristennetten @ZubyMusic @BillyM2k My kids introduced me to the game!  I went down a deep Polytopia rabbit hole for a while. Got to #1 on Perfection once and a 1609 ELO; then had to pull the plug; as it was taking up too much cognitive load even when I wasn’t playing the game.
1,@willchamberlain Wow; the situation is even more insane than I realized!
1,@ZubyMusic @BillyM2k Actually; I do play Diablo with my eldest boy (and friends in different cities).   Online games are a good way to stay in touch with people around the world.
1,@BillyM2k I play Diablo during my daily 3 hour conversations with Putin

1,Tomorrow’s vote is a fork in human destiny
1,@stat_sherpa @TheRabbitHole84 Just followed
1,Absolutely
1,The counter to misinformation is not censorship; but better information
1,Vote for @realDonaldTrump or the Dems will legalize so many illegals in swing states that this will be the last real election in America.   @JoeRogan agrees.    https://t.co/AtPVm3lSr2
1,@StephenKing Vote for @realDonaldTrump!
1,Speaking of misinformation …
1,8 years ago
1,It just gets crazier and crazier!
1,Instead of a town hall Q&amp;A tonight; I recommend listening to this discussion about the election I had today with Joe Rogan
1,@stillgray He never not misses 😂
1,@AutismCapital Epic party trick tbh
1,Worth listening to this @JoeRogan episode before end of voting tomorrow   https://t.co/qNchBVR0f9
1,@AndrewGray7734 @AutismCapital The OCD level required for this is extremely high 🤣🤣

1,I’m doing a digital town hall on 𝕏 tonight at 8:30 ET
1,@PeterSweden7 That’s what happens when people believe the legacy “mainstream” media
1,@ajtourville @SpaceX It is the best system
1,@ajtourville @ResilientRye Arresting me is their wet dream!
1,It will get far worse under a Kamala puppet regime
1,The Dems will tell whatever lie wins the election

1,So here’s the thing … https://t.co/X9En85Qw1Z
1,@FischerKing64 Exactly
1,How ironic that the same people on the left who say that they want to stop “disinformation” are also the ones pushing debunked hoaxes relentlessly …
1,@stevenmarkryan Occasional bs or exaggeration is one thing – anyone in politics does that – but pushing repeated; deliberate; calculated lies over and over again is outrageous
1,@jasondebolt Yeah; if we lose this election it is game tf over
1,@pmarca Yeah 😔
1,@naval True; that instinct runs deep
1,@stevenmarkryan Exactly
1,Last election; I didn’t know a single independent/swing voter who was voting for Trump.   This time; I don’t know anyone who isn’t.  And one person after another has confided in me that they’re voting for Trump; but they’re afraid to say so publicly; because it will affect their
1,Yeah; it’s totally insane.   The only reason to ban ID is to make voting fraud untraceable.   Obviously.

1,@realDonaldTrump Indeed; enough is enough
1,@SwipeWright @naval Exactly
1,@naval Having kids is a vote for the future
1,@diana_dukic @StephenKing One day; he will admit his love 💕
1,@bindureddy Yeah!
1,@WilliamShatner @NYSDEC So messed up.   How many times does this happen that we never hear about?
1,@StephenKing Stephen; you pay more attention than my biggest fans 🥰
1,@StephenKing I can’t believe you counted how many posts I’ve made lmaooo
1,Vote  For PNut! For Liberty! For Freedom!
1,Whoa; this is crazy!
1,Funny that she has never said a word about Soros; who has cumulatively put a hundred times more money into elections than I have 🤔  If I can figure out 🚀science with SpaceX and 🧠 surgery with Neuralink; then maybe I can figure out politics too 🤷‍♂️
1,@ajtourville There isn’t even enough helium produced on Earth to supply a high flight rate Starship
1,@markpinc I’ve seriously had it with this bullshit!  It’s such an insult to the American public.
1,@Brick_Suit @CollinRugg True. They stole the nomination from @BernieSanders. It was wrong.
1,The number of times that the Dems have deliberately pushed this hoax – a calculated lie – is unconscionable!

1,@GailAlfarATX Nice piece
1,It is unfair; even if SNL did so unintentionally; given that NBC is allowed to use public airwaves for free

1,@DefiyantlyFree Exactly
1,Good point

1,@DavidSHolz Inevitable
1,@Benioff Indeed
1,Thanks Steve!
1,@TheRabbitHole84 @SkepResCenter The propaganda level is crazy
1,Send people links to the actual source data on https://t.co/bOUOek5Cvy!  All it takes is for people to hear @realDonaldTrump’s actual speeches or to see a compilation of Jewish speakers at the MSG rally to start realizing how much they were lied to by legacy media.
1,@EndWokeness Yeah
1,True
1,But the legacy media says this never happens
1,@iam_smx Making good progress
1,@Rothmus They never actually move to Canada (unfortunately)
1,It is NOT ok for the government to barge into your home and kill your pets!  What has become of the Land of the Free?
1,@fentasyl The Trump administration will make evidence-based decisions. For my part; I will certainly strongly and publicly oppose anything based on mystical nonsense!  My inclination is in favor of fluoride; but I am open to hearing evidence against it too.
1,@stillgray She’s so out of touch
1,What it’s like if someone only watches legacy media 😂  They aren’t just drinking the Kool-Aid; they’re swimming in it!  Vital to send https://t.co/bOUOek6al6 links to your friends. https://t.co/HbrTXax8VN
1,@shellenberger @KamalaHarris @realDonaldTrump @BrendanCarrFCC Yeah; that futile attempt to sway the election using public airwaves was not cool
1,💯  Those are their stated goals!  Unless @realDonaldTrump wins; this will be the last election.   The Dems will legalize all the illegals in swing states; so there be no more swing states. America will become a one-party; deep blue socialist state.
1,@SaltyGoat17 @CollinRugg Literally zero
1,Yeah
1,@stillgray Yeah
1,@MdBreathe The hypocrisy level is astounding
1,@natemcgrady Cool
1,@_johnnymaga I’m pretty sure that never happened even once
1,Power to the people!
1,@nypost Obviously
1,@DefiyantlyFree Correct.   As of yesterday’s data; D vs R early votes are 602k worse for D than 2020 when Biden only had an 80k margin of victory.   That is almost 10% of the probable electorate (6.9M voted in 2020)!  Unless something very strange happens; Ds will have a blowout loss in PA.
1,Citizen journalism is the only way to break out of the legacy media propaganda machine.   Send https://t.co/bOUOek5Cvy link to your friends!
1,@ajtourville @Starlink Cool
1,Putting only one Presidential candidate on right before the election was not cool; but this is very funny 😂  https://t.co/CEGZj6O868

1,@WesternLensman Their new name is DNN (Disinformation News Network)
1,@alx She’s the nitwit who claimed people in the hood don’t know how to use the Internet🤦‍♂️
1,Absolutely
1,Doesn’t that seem insanely messed up?
1,There should be no need for FOIA requests. All government data should be default public for maximum transparency.
1,@shellenberger They are so desperate that they’re willing to violate election laws!
1,I’m this accurate @CommunityNotes?
1,@RealPatrickWebb What??
1,@Caitlyn_Jenner @mayemusk So true
1,She wants to break the Constitution
1,@amuse @DefiantWorld What a cruel thing to say
1,Exactly.   It is easy for Cheney to send others to die while having fancy dinners in DC; but she would think very differently if on the front lines herself.
1,Correct.   In fact; SpaceX received only half the money that Boeing did to develop a crewed spacecraft; yet has done ALL the completed missions!
1,Every year; your freedom is eroded with millions of new rules.   High time your freedom was restored!
1,Exactly
1,@JonErlichman I put the last of my the money I made from PayPal into that round. Had nothing  left; not even a house.
1,@MarioNawfal Does seem to break the equal airtime on public spectrum rule
1,@VishBurra Yeah
1,Support the right to bear arms!
1,@stillgray Deeply wrong
1,@_johnnymaga Her sad question to the SNL cast member hoping she was registered to vote in Pennsylvania tells it all: that state is the key to the election and she’s losing badly.
1,@farzyness Yeah
1,@MarioNawfal @jordanbpeterson @GadSaad @mayemusk Yeah
1,Cool 😎
1,@WesternLensman Ironically; the Democrats are massively outspending Republicans in this election!!  I would gladly take the deal that all money needs to come out of politics. The Dems would be far worse off.
1,Pennsylvania is on track for a major Republican victory.   The gap between 2024 and 2020 is now over 600k; which almost 10% of the entire electorate! https://t.co/1IGuyjM0Xx
1,@DavidSacks Yeah
1,Exactly
1,@spyflips @pmarca Her name is Shrub; the Hedgehog
1,@pmarca Many of these NGOs are heavily funded by the government; which makes them a GNGO self-licking ice cream cone.   Only way to break this is to elect politicians who will stop funding them.
1,@westcoastbill Same. Raccoon too.   Why not just release them into the woods?

1,@AravSrinivas Thanks!
1,@gopher_marc @charliekirk11 Haha exactly
1,True
1,@angadc @AutismCapital Our hedgehog loves running on her wheel for hours!
1,The government should not be allowed to barge into your house and kill your pet! That’s messed up.   Even if it is illegal to have a pet squirrel (which it shouldn’t be); why kill PNut instead of simply releasing him into the forest!?
1,Yeah
1,This is something new for an historically deep blue city!
1,@teslaownersSV @mayemusk True.   I would actually tell my Mom that she should be more skeptical that I’m right!

1,Democratic Party priority list … https://t.co/t25wGNeoVO
1,Actually true.   Worth noting that criminals vote overwhelmingly for Democrats; because they are the soft-on-crime party.   The Democratic Party is literally the party of criminals! Just a statement of fact.

1,The government should leave people and their animals alone
1,The legacy media is the propaganda arm of the radical leftists; so will immediately go after anyone who merely wants centrist policies and fairness for all.   The policy positions of my @America PAC are just common sense and moderate by any reasonable definition.
1,@TiffanyFong_ The illusion of him being in charge has been broken. He was always just a puppet; as is Kamala.
1,Government overreach kidnapped an orphan squirrel and executed him …
1,Exactly. The reason that the public no longer trusts the legacy media is that the media has been exposed as lying too many times to count.   Legacy media absolutely deserves the lack of respect and ridicule it gets.  Just yesterday; the legacy media tried to claim that

1,@shaunmmaguire Thanks 🫡
1,@neilsiegel @Tesla Coming very soon
1,@Kreative Vastly better maps/nav coming soon
1,@Jason @Tesla Sure
1,@kabirakhtar Yeah; it’s terrible. Had to upgrade old Linux OS and a bunch of drivers first. Major browser upgrades coming to all cars in a few months. Note; will be slower at first until code is optimized.
1,@sustainableanna @VanSeedBank Similar total size. Maybe slightly bigger to account for a really gamechanging (I think) feature I’d like to add.
1,@IamSamCrompton Sustainable energy production with solar and batteries will grow much faster than auto on a percentage basis. That will be a big focus next year; with primary remaining Model 3 ramp.
1,@MCFlashTube Was gonna say we’ll do all but the last; but that last one sounds like good; cheesy fun :)
1,@MadsVeiby Should be in next update
1,@moskov Done
1,@VanSeedBank I promise that we will make a pickup truck right after Model Y. Have had the core design/engineering elements in my mind for almost 5 years. Am dying to build it.
1,@SeanMahoneyAP Sorry for the delay. We have the most advanced AI neural net of any consumer product by far; so it’s going through exhaustive testing. The results are blowing me away though and I think you will have a similar experience.
1,Wanted again to send a note of deep gratitude to Tesla owners WW for taking a chance on a new company that all experts said would fail.   So much blood; sweat &amp; tears from the Tesla team went into creating cars that you’d truly love. I hope you do.  How can we improve further?

1,@ben_made_new @paulkrugman I would only call someone an idiot if people were mistakenly under the impression that the person was smart
1,@paulkrugman However; public transit is obviously not fully solving the problem; as most major cities have been in traffic hell for decades with no solution in sight. Multi-level tunnels can solve this; but we need much better tunneling technology; as it is currently super slow and expensive.
1,@Youri_Hart Major navigation overhaul coming in early 2018. Will be light-years ahead of current system; but we are testing it rigorously before rolling out.
1,@paulkrugman For the record; I actually love trains; most subways and London buses.
1,@paulkrugman Idiots can be very dangerous when they seem smart; but aren’t (having “PhD” in their bio is a dead giveaway); as some policymakers may get fooled. That’s what really bothered me about that human cat meme / transit “expert”.
1,Glad to see that Tesla owners are having a good experience. Working to improve further. Some cool software updates coming soon. https://t.co/16NabnHeuD

1,@sally_alcot @NASA If things go perfectly; all three rocket booster cores will come back and land. Sides back at the Cape; center on the droneship.
1,Falcon Heavy launching from same @NASA pad as the Saturn V Apollo 11 moon rocket. It was 50% higher thrust with five F-1 engines at 7.5M lb-F. I love that rocket so much.
1,Max thrust at lift-off is 5.1 million pounds or 2300 metric tons. First mission will run at 92%.

1,@WIRED Good point. It’s just a really bad and fundamentally misleading article that doesn’t actually represent my point of view at all. Other publications referred to it as an “interview”.
1,@humantransit You’re an idiot
1,@WIRED This depressingly misleading &amp; misanthropic article came from a very brief digression at an AI conf; not from an interview with Wired as is falsely implied. This is why I stopped following Wired long ago. There are way better tech pubs out there.

1,"@FredericLambert @MacTechGenius @blundell_apps There is only one config being built right now; so the only question is ""What color?"". Don't need a configurator for that."
1,@FredericLambert @MacTechGenius @blundell_apps Bear in mind that the production ramp is an exponential curve. Late Oct is possible; but not certain. Literally every day makes a big difference.
1,@MacTechGenius @blundell_apps Dec will be a big month; so probably; but it is impossible to be certain right now
1,@OutOnALumb @engadget Yeah

1,@MacTechGenius @Jon4Lakers @solarcity @Tesla Not good. Sounds like some 3rd party installers are taking advantage of Powerwall demand &gt;&gt; supply. Taking action …
1,@ismailnathij @stapf @Tesla The internal Tesla Powerwall install team in PR is very small right now. Sending experienced installers from continental US to hire &amp; train local team as fast as possible.
1,@ismailnathij @stapf @Tesla Tesla always charges the same price for a Powerwall (only taxes &amp; shipping costs vary); so something is messed up here. I've asked my team to stop shipment to any installers charging excessive premiums.
1,@ricardorossello Sounds good; I look forward to talking later today
1,@ricardorossello I would be happy to talk. Hopefully; Tesla can be helpful.

1,@SU3UR3ANLegend Sorry! Coming next year; along with completing the Trans-Canada Highway and interconnecting US; Mexico and Central America.
1,@bobbyblackstock @c12olivas Funny thing is; whenever I suggest all companies go to zero incentives; room gets very quiet. That's because others get a lot more than us.

1,@alexeheath @RolfeWinkler @julieverhage It was misinterpreted by Rolfe at WSJ as a fundraising effort. Neuralink is not seeking investors.
1,@berlinhedgehog @jmackin2 WSJ has been laboriously negative for over a decade. I'm surprised they haven't bored their readers to death by now.
1,Max recovered booster velocity was Mach 7.9 (BulgarianSat). Energy is velocity squared; so this is a bigger difference than it appears
1,Max velocity: Mach 6.9 Max altitude: 247 km Highest so far; but velocity matters much more

1,If you want this to happen fast; please let your local &amp; federal elected representatives know. Makes a big difference if they hear from you.
1,Still a lot of work needed to receive formal approval; but am optimistic that will occur rapidly

1,@SpaceX @INTELSAT Thanks @INTELSAT! Really proud of the rocket and SpaceX team today. Min apogee requirement was 28;000 km; Falcon 9 achieved 43;000 km.
1,SpaceX team reviewed all systems again late last night. Done our best to ensure all is good. https://t.co/R3YrF6PEt4
1,@SpaceX We're going to spend the 4th doing a full review of rocket &amp; pad systems. Launch no earlier than 5th/6th. Only one chance to get it right …
1,Wanted to say thanks to all that own or ordered a Tesla. It matters to us that you took a risk on a new car company. We won't forget.
1,Looks like we can reach 20;000 Model 3 cars per month in Dec
1,Handover party for first 30 customer Model 3's on the 28th! Production grows exponentially; so Aug should be 100 cars and Sept above 1500.

1,Sped up version of today's rocket landing on the Droneship Just Read the Instructions (guess it… https://t.co/0wFgXMgeqZ
1,@nullpointr More aero effectiveness to create steep spires on windward side at the grid fin intersections
1,@amirmasoudabdol Down the road; they will not even be repainted between launches. Aiming to be able to relaunch same orbital rocket booster in &lt;24 hours.
1,@BenjaminCoop3 Getting closer to fairing recovery and reuse. Had some problems with the steerable parachute. Should have it sorted out by end of year.
1,New titanium grid fins worked even better than expected. Should be capable of an indefinite number of flights with no service.
1,@mjmdavis Still humans
1,@TheCocoaNaut Significantly improves control force

1,@dnathe4th @DJSnM We used to have a (lame) open loop hydraulic system; but that was upgraded to closed about 2 years ago
1,@CrappyUsername Not only that; it has all the wifis and 3G is coming soon
1,@EcoHeliGuy Rocket was suddenly slammed sideways right before landing. Heavy gust or something malfunctioned onboard. Reviewing telemetry.
1,@zerosixbravo @john_gilleran True; but that's a minor factor for rockets
1,@ClovenLife No; but shielding got fragged every flight. More control authority is for Falcon Heavy; but also enables Falcon 9 to land in heavier winds.
1,@DJSnM They will; but the hydraulic system is closed loop; so no fluid lost. They do need more power &amp; energy; but rocket has plenty of that.
1,@zerosixbravo Slightly heavier than shielded aluminum; but more control authority and can be reused indefinitely with no touch ups
1,Flying with larger &amp; significantly upgraded hypersonic grid fins. Single piece cast &amp; cut titanium. Can take reentry heat with no shielding. https://t.co/SmyCCQRt2F
1,@sajo Sticking to 100
1,@Emerald0013 It's an aluminum honeycomb cartridge; so only a couple of hours to replace
1,Rocket is extra toasty and hit the deck hard (used almost all of the emergency crush core); but otherwise good
1,Falcon 9 will experience its highest ever reentry force and heat in today's launch. Good chance rocket booster doesn't make it back.

1,@FredericLambert @samabuelsamid @TeslaMotors Heard about it. Our experience doing projects with big car companies was not great. They move slowly &amp; are reluctant to adopt new tech.
1,@samabuelsamid @TeslaMotors I've written two forward-looking master plans; but haven't told the Tesla history of how we got there. Lot of drama … Prob worth doing?
1,@samabuelsamid @TeslaMotors Mostly right. The feasibility study Martin commissioned about the Lotus Elise was dead wrong though. Only 7% of parts ended up being common.

1,@WaldekKubicki @shazm01 Interesting idea. Would give a dynamic 360 deg surround view as you're driving. Have this in dev mode. Can be a bit distracting though.
1,@sethjacob14 Early next year. To start with; we're making the simplest Model 3 first; like we did with S. Didn't do it with X; because I was an idiot.
1,@shazm01 We could add that function pretty easily from a technical standpoint. Just need to add in the billing software.

1,@noradio @MCornell0 @marks22 Exactly
1,@tony_lo Still on for end of year. Just software limited. Any Tesla car with HW2 (all cars built since Oct last year) will be able to do this.
1,@freerobby @jetkohli There's just no way. Hundreds of parts and most of wiring harness would have to be replaced. Would cost more to retrofit than trading in.
1,@marks22 HW2. HW1 doesn't have enough sensors and computing power.
1,@harropj Hopefully June for those too
1,@MacBenTosh S for sure. It is a bigger car.
1,@jetkohli I'd highly recommend upgrading to latest Model S (which is approx version 4). Only if you really want a smaller sedan; should you get a 3.

1,@samgalaviz_ Tesla needs to iterate fast on solar roof prefab/install technology; so all installs will be done by Tesla techs at first
1,@Tragik187 Third one will be from Frost. Maybe the second.
1,@Armstrong_Anth Yes. Good.
1,First machine is Godot. Still waiting ... Don't know why; when or where.
1,Naming theme for tunnel boring machines will be poems &amp; plays. Decided against plays &amp; poems. Too obvious.
1,@sahilmalik That's how the tiles sit on the roof. There is no difference in strength for the Tesla tile based on orientation (not like wood).
1,@Lee_Ars This is true. The economics are not yet compelling where housing and utility costs are low and property taxes are high.
1,Slo-mo hail cannonball impacting Tesla solar roof tile https://t.co/MMBAcUD9iC
1,@cubamark Will do our best. Hopefully; yes.
1,Solar roof can be ordered for almost any country. Deployment this year in the US and overseas next year.
1,@torbenanderson U.K. delivery and installation next year
1,Tesla solar glass roof orders open this afternoon. I think it will be great. More in about 10 hours ...

1,@jovanik21 Thanks for doing it!
1,Headed to see Guardians 2 w my bro and kids. Loved the first one.
1,@keithdcohen I do love Banks; but perhaps we should reserve his names for the droneships
1,@zanesloanbc Simple. I like it.
1,Kinda like Snoop Dug
1,@AndrewHws I don't want to be presumptuous
1,"I know what you're thinking … then why not ""the Third""? Well; I've learned my lesson about 3's."

1,@juancarlosrs @elpilot That is the aspiration: to avoid AI becoming other.
1,@FredericLambert @TaylorSMarks @FlipperB @pkingdesign Yeah; sorry I missed that. This would only work for 75 kWh packs that are software created to 60; so not 2013.

1,@SamGonzales Next gen Roadster will be convertible
1,Tesla Semi truck unveil set for September. Team has done an amazing job. Seriously next level.
1,@danahull @Reuters Yeah
1,@Reuters Besides; I already said we'd add more independent members during SCTY merger. Will announce soon; but this group has nothing to do with it.

1,Technology breakthrough: turns out chemtrails are actually a message from time-traveling aliens describing the secret of teleportation
1,@BadAstronomer We can def bring it back like Dragon. Just a question of how much weight we need to add.
1,@tesla_addict @TeslaMotors Working on it
1,@jasonlamb Looks like it could do 20% more with some structural upgrades to handle higher loads. But that's in fully expendable mode.
1,@cheron A lot
1,@Cardoso Silliest thing we can imagine! Secret payload of 1st Dragon flight was a giant wheel of cheese. Inspired by a friend &amp; Monty Python.
1,@redletterdave Good point; odds go from 0% to &gt;0% :)
1,Falcon Heavy test flight currently scheduled for late summer
1,Considering trying to bring upper stage back on Falcon Heavy demo flight for full reusability. Odds of success low; but maybe worth a shot.
1,@oxfordteddy Browser is already a little better. Kernel and browser update in prob 6 weeks or so (lots of underlying changes) with a few nice features.
1,@BadAstronomer @SpaceX Thanks Phil!
1,Incredibly proud of the SpaceX team for achieving this milestone in space! Next goal is reflight within 24 hours.
1,If you just downloaded V8.1; tap the the T on center screen three times
1,@drmanejwala @arctechinc On center screen. Also; center screen *will* show speed as an overlay that changes opacity according to relevance.

1,Here is the latest SpaceX travel ad for the flight around the moon &amp; into deep space. Maybe needs a few edits ... https://t.co/mA8ZgutrbE
1,Long Neuralink piece coming out on @waitbutwhy in about a week. Difficult to dedicate the time; but existential risk is too high not to.
1,@erikhaaland We cannot make all country versions simultaneously or the production start would be a disaster. You would get first in Norway.
1,@nickbaum I believe so
1,@Mr_Ewe_Guy Oh so little faith
1,@kryniog The shorter wheelbase only allows for a 75 kWh pack in Model 3 at current cell/module energy densities
1,@ToddGerkens Yeah
1,@HolsMichael Start taking orders in April
1,@dr_angus Yeah; probably a year from now. S will still win on acceleration though; due to having more space for a larger battery.
1,@akaWrecks @ckalapala Only Model S will have the seven seater option; more cargo space; plus higher range; acceleration; two screens vs one; auto extend handles …
1,@CamKode The Model S produced today is arguably version 4. Let me put it this way: it is the car I will keep driving even after Model 3 arrives.
1,@BlueBowles If fate is on our side; it will be amazing. Will talk about that in detail next week.
1,@juanmlemao No problem :)
1,@DJBurges Should be summer next year. Sorry; really wish we could get RHD done sooner. We truly are working as fast as we can.
1,@faultywarrior @matt_trulli @FredericLambert @TimShelton @JimPengelly Let me just go fetch my magic wand ...
1,@TimShelton @FredericLambert @JimPengelly First in line for dual motor as soon as we can make it; which is probably in 6 to 9 months.
1,@meangene2030 Damn straight we do! Coming with 8.1 next week.
1,First drive of a release candidate version of Model 3 https://t.co/zcs6j1YRa4
1,@FredericLambert It still has one display
1,@VoltzCoreAudio Nothing majorly new that a consumer would notice. Lots of new tech in the design and production process though.
1,@arctechinc The more autonomous a car is; the less dash info you need. How often do you look at the instrument panel when being driven in a taxi?
1,@asimo3089 How about the video we just took of the first Model 3 release candidate drive?
1,@trabru Yup; machine arrives next month and we start digging the tunnel!
1,@oakhaller I think so
1,@FredericLambert @JimPengelly No; we are minimizing configuration complexity to keep the production ramp on schedule. RWD only for early production; just like Model S.
1,@Trojan81 Tues/Wed
1,@jDaz Because I was a dumb idiot and didn't realize at the time that it would cause confusion
1,@timothymjr Tues/Wed next week
1,@Skate_a_book Yes. Model S will always be the fastest Tesla until next gen Roadster; which is a few years away.
1,@JimPengelly Yes; but not until next year
1,@AlSaibie Yes. Hardware already on all production S and X cars.
1,@theKen_Miller Sorta. Model 3 is like a BMW 3 series or Audi A4. Model S is like BMW 5 and 6 series; but much faster; more storage space + Autopilot
1,@Greg525 How about now?
1,@varunfatehpuria Oh Model Y is coming too in a few years. Kinda have to.
1,@luciojr All Tesla cars built since Oct last year will be capable of self-driving as software improves
1,@swindeez Definitely
1,Model 3 was going to be called Model E; for obvious dumb humor reasons; but Ford sued to block it; so now it is S3X. Totally different :)
1,Model 3 is just a smaller; more affordable version of Model S w less range &amp; power &amp; fewer features. Model S has more advanced technology.
1,"Am noticing that many people think Model 3 is the ""next version"" of a Tesla; like iPhone 2 vs 3. This is not true."
1,@macwalterslives Looking forward to playing the game with my kids!
1,@aaronpaul_8 I used to be one. You're welcome. Trying my best; at least. Hope it's a bit useful.
1,@nextspaceflight @inversedotcom Just because I'm building a spaceship to get back to my home planet doesn't mean I'm an alien
1,@lennart375 @inversedotcom The number of extinct single planet civilizations probably exceeds live civs by at least a thousand to one. I'm being optimistic.

1,@karaswisher Perhaps there will be some future bill that makes a difference for Mars; but this is not it.
1,@karaswisher I am not. This bill changes almost nothing about what NASA is doing. Existing programs stay in place and there is no added funding for Mars.
1,@CapnJesus @Lurpatron @MKBHD @jakerawr 3 is a great car; but definitely Model S

1,@BizbuilderUSA @mcannonbrookes It's been a bear to get done; but prob 10 days or so; depending on full speed autosteer test results
1,@Legit_bacon @mcannonbrookes Looking forward to it. I know it's cliche; but LotR is my favorite book ever :) Want to see the set and take my kids on tour of greater NZ.
1,@5AllanLeVito @mcannonbrookes @VGroysman Sure. Just check out my prior tweet on pricing ($250 kWh at pack level). Website will be updated soon; so there is complete transparency.
1,.@mcannonbrookes Can only happen with your support; and working closely with key govt and utility leaders who are strongly committed to trying new approaches
1,Just wanted to write a note of appreciation to the many Australians who came out in support of the battery plan; especially @mcannonbrookes
1,@ah_pton16 I love Wikipedia. Just gets better over time.
1,"@JMMZHerrera Answer is complex for electric motors. We use an AC induction motor fed by a DC pack thru an IGBT inverter; which kinda ""digitizes"" DC power"
1,@williamwinters High voltage DC is for sure the best way to transmit electricity over long distances. Good explanation at https://t.co/FOjClHhYiL
1,Ironically; direct current is the right approach today; even though alternating was right in the past. Solar power &amp; electronics both DC.
1,You're most welcome. Very exciting to discuss the future of electricity. Renewables + storage arguably biggest disruption since DC to AC. https://t.co/7uXoUQf29f
1,@mcannonbrookes Just spoke with @JayWeatherill; Premier of South Australia. Very impressed. Govt is clearly committed to a smart; quick solution.
1,@shails Yes; but shipping; taxes/tariffs and installation labor vary by country; as those costs are beyond our control
1,@mcannonbrookes $250/kWh at the pack level for 100MWh+ systems. Tesla is moving to fixed and open pricing and terms for all products.
1,@mcannonbrookes Tesla will get the system installed and working 100 days from contract signature or it is free. That serious enough for you?
1,@Zedd Will send you one

1,@MacTechGenius of course
1,@DueDiamond maybe one of those too

1,@donbarbieri @GreenCarReports Good chance it will
1,@davidshepardson @BW @ATT @ToysRUs Exactly :)
1,@adrianvolts Minor improvements update this weekend. High speed autosteer in about two weeks.
1,Just posted a video https://t.co/RCV7MVi8rs
1,@Xuan_Thai System was green for launch. I called it off.
1,@spacecom They are often right; but; in this case; we have already retired so much R&amp;D risk on Dragon 2; that I feel very confident of 2018.
1,@zperrin99 Uses high pressure bleed off the fuel side (RP-1 kerosene) turbopump; so no dedicated pump or fluid needed
1,Btw; 99% likely to be fine (closed loop TVC wd overcome error); but that 1% chance isn't worth rolling the dice. Better to wait a day.
1,@Zybbby Not obviously related to the (very tiny) helium leak; but also not out of the question
1,If this is the only issue; flight would be fine; but need to make sure that it isn't symptomatic of a more significant upstream root cause
1,All systems go; except the movement trace of an upper stage engine steering hydraulic piston was slightly odd. Standing down to investigate.

1,@mdcdave yes; altitude improves performance for electric. Opposite of combustion cars.
1,@jovanik21 @Veidit No; will be lower. Wheelbase can't fit 100.
1,@jovanik21 Also; Tesla service can remove front trunk liner if you don't use it and improve performance further
1,@Veidit No plans to take X; S (or 3) above 100 kWh. Semi necessarily and pickup truck maybe will go above.

1,@christesla @FredericLambert Almost there. We are just being very careful with the rollout.
1,@trylks A lot of terrible things could happen in four years of extremism. Do you really want another war? That's where extremism leads.
1,@FredericLambert Yeah; it is hard to convey complex ideas in 140 chars and tone is lost in text
1,@CycleTrades @rtoro20 People should push to have as many moderates advising the President as possible. Blind hate is never the right answer.

1,@BitterMercy @CallumK24 Actually; I think it's kinda cool :)
1,@EricHaegler @iLexomat Isn't that basically like having a jury of peers? That is a default option in the US.
1,@vladsavov Those countries have strong justice systems; but I'd put them roughly on par with US. That rating system conflates many factors.
1,@FifthRocket Did you read my tweets? I attacked it hard. Did not defend.
1,@KENEMONICS You're right. Politics is a no-win situation. Somebody is going to hate what you say no matter what that is.
1,@martinengwicht Also good. There are several that are on par with US. Just don't think any are better. People confuse laws with courts.
1,@paulvankeep Mostly anti-drug laws
1,@zgiarrizzo Exactly
1,@TheLAAdams The laws need to change. Judges are responsible for evaluating whether an action breaks the law; not making law.
1,@humplik The remedy for that is changing the law
1,@CallumK24 Ok; but what's up the wigs?
1,@iLexomat There are many good legal systems on par with US. Just don't know any that are better.
1,@Biesseman True!
1,Many in America don't realize how proud they should be of the legal system. Not perfect; but nowhere is the cause of justice better served.
1,@nintendomaniac @alext4627 I wish!

1,There has already been and there will be progress on this matter
1,Regarding the meeting at the White House: https://t.co/8b1XH4oW6h
1,@SarahFKessler @qz Headline &amp; article is misleading. I said it won't be retracted (ie withdrawn by Pres). It may be revoked by judicial or legislative means.

1,Auto steer limited to 45 mph on highways for now; i.e. heavy traffic; where it is needed most. Limit will raise as we get more data.
1,@dnansink40 Autonomy capability should improve via OTA every 2 to 6 weeks
1,@TheSammyyyD For now
1,@HendrikStruik The 100D price takes into account exchange rate shifts; whereas other vehicle prices haven't yet been adjusted
1,@gdoehne @reddit Yes. Block 5 is the final upgrade of the Falcon architecture. Significantly improves performance &amp; ease of reusability. Flies end of year.
1,@dtweiseth If we applied resources to doing super complex retrofits; our pace of innovation would drop dramatically
1,@dtweiseth Tesla will never stop innovating. People are buying the wrong car if they expect this. There will be major revs every 12 to 18 months.
1,@VinnyLingham Unfortunately; that would require stripping down the entire car and replacing 300+ parts. Wish there was an easy way.
1,Giant X made of Model X's by Tesla owners in China! https://t.co/54wXBKiKvp
1,@gdoehne Expendable. Future flights will go on Falcon Heavy or the upgraded Falcon 9.
1,@jakebathman Car won't complete camera calibration. Working on software solution to adjust image crop dynamically; so camera more robust to pitch angle.
1,Autopilot for HW2 rolling out to all HW2 cars today. Please be cautious. Some cars will require adjustment of camera pitch angle by service.
1,Validating a GPU driver fix and camera pitch angle health check for HW2
1,@UKPJD Similar to SpaceX; the T is like a cross section of an electric motor; just as the X is like a rocket trajectory
1,@TOCHOTE Our target is a 90% reduction with HW2 as the software matures
1,@cameronrad Not specifically; but there have been several incidences of pedestrian and bicyclist lives saved by Autopilot
1,@ModularLifeSys @NHTSAgov It might. Am not sure.
1,@gavinnwaters Looking good so far. Should roll out this weekend.
1,Report highlight: “The data show that the Tesla vehicles crash rate dropped by almost 40 percent after Autosteer installation.”
1,Final report on Autopilot issued by @NHTSAgov is very positive https://t.co/KsOZSrr3l9
1,@visakanv One million
1,Falcon before launch https://t.co/QqxvtBijoF

1,@OlivierW4 There will be many improvements to HW1 over the course of the year
1,@Brian_Ashcraft Yeah; it has a lot of potential
1,"Rewatched ""Ghost in the Shell"" and the end of ""Colossus: The Forbin Project"" https://t.co/ZVUR5RzE5C"
1,HW2 Autopilot now downloading to all HW2 cars; but in non-actuating mode to assess reliability. If looks good; actuation by end of week.
1,@JimDeKort @SpaceX Rotates 180 degrees and does a retro burn
1,@JimDeKort @SpaceX It does
1,Liftoff https://t.co/pcVJOvFHY2
1,All satellites deployed
1,Mission looks good. Started deploying the 10 Iridium satellites. Rocket is stable on the droneship.
1,@brandonr182 @sama Have you tried steam engines? They are amazing.
1,@MotorTrend Sarah should be in contact with you soon about doing a benchmark test
1,@gurnam @brianstucki @reddit It is
1,@JRMYGRNBRGR Hopefully; early next week. Results from limited release look good so far. Trying our best to be super careful.
1,@trevoclark Good point. 2.34 would be a production Tesla. Stripped down; maybe as low as 2.1.
1,@robsmallshire @ClareMacraeUK It will
1,Promising early results from the Ludricrous Easter egg. Looks like 0 to 60 mph in 2.34 sec (Motor Trend spec) might be achievable...
1,@mjreddyMD If the results look good from the latest point release; then we are days away from a release to all HW1 and to all HW2 early next week
1,@redletterdave The least cool characters...it's embarrassing
1,@mbhnyc It will in an upcoming release later this year
1,@TeslaMotors Tesla's approach to building an autonomy platform is focused on high compute efficiency machine learning. Primarily vision w radar &amp; sonar.
1,@matt_mantyla @TeslaMotors Increasing capacity at existing Supercharger locations now has top priority. Some are overflowing while a nearby one is empty.
1,@OlivierW4 Longitudinal control will; but lateral (steering) control will cap at 35 mph for a bit longer. Will raise after full fleet data rolls in.
1,If all looks good; HW2 Autopilot functionality will switch from shadow to active mode by end of week for cars beyond initial 1000
1,New rev for Autopilot HW2 rolling out Mon to first 1000 &amp; to rest of fleet in shadow mode. Also improves HW1 and enables Ludicrous+.
1,@fatihorhan @SpaceX That was a great game
1,Hold-down firing of @SpaceX Falcon 9 at Vandenberg Air Force completed. All systems are go for launch next week.
1,HW2 Autopilot software uploading to 1000 cars this eve. Will then hold to verify no field issues and upload to rest of fleet next week.
1,@vicentes @DragTimes Late Jan; along with Linux kernel upgrade
1,@DragTimes Yes; but held up by Autopilot . It def works tho in shaving 0.1 sec off 0-60mph &amp; 1/4 mile. If AP goes tmrw; then perf upgrade goes Thurs.
1,Resolving an Autopilot HW2 bug that shows up when booting from a subzero cold-soak. If that fix works; software will start uploading tmrw.

1,@djsearle @FredericLambert Yes; grid won't be needed for moderate use Superchargers in non-snowy regions
1,@FredericLambert A mere 350 kW ... what are you referring to; a children's toy?
1,@yamenalhaddad Brain is full right now and that's a hard one
1,@FredericLambert There are some installed already; but full rollout really needs Supercharger V3 and Powerpack V2; plus SolarCity. Pieces now in place.
1,@ddaogaru If you don't like the P100DL; you can give it back
1,@wpconner Good idea
1,@SweensChris Should complete in 2017. One is def planned for Swift Current; near my cousin's wheat farm where I had my 18th bday.
1,@darkdude203 It is keyed off the volume of music in the car. If you turn that down w left scroll wheel; it will be quieter.
1,@CMaggiore50 Typing Mars after holding down the T symbol on the center console works on S and X. Also try renaming your car 42.
1,Make sure your car is connected to wifi for the update. Will update over its cell connection too; but takes much longer.
1,To activate the Model X holiday performance; just type holidays or ModelXmas after pressing the logo. Also; Mars. https://t.co/8Cy7YPlECX
1,@CJDSB Looking promising for next week
1,@pcwizardllc No major precipitating event; but people in general were going a bit too fast on winding roads
1,@pcwizardllc Will be restored soon where there is a lead vehicle; ie you are being overtaken a lot due to true traffic speed being higher than the sign
1,@Thebeazles Night is easy. Twilight is hardest.
1,@vicentes That is actually rolling out to all Model X's right now
1,@SamLawrence 8.1; which hopefully goes out next week.
1,@DragTimes Hoping for next week. Also going through validation.
1,Looks like we might be ready to rollout most of Autopilot functionality for HW2 towards the end of next week
1,Tesla receives highest owner satisfaction score of any carmaker in Consumer Reports survey https://t.co/NpJYkz8MgA

1,@adrianvolts @TeslaMotors @TeslaMotorsClub @Teslarati Tesla software team is working seven days a week to complete testing and validation. Getting close.
1,@ChromeJS10 Should start changing soon
1,I am actually going to do this
1,@TeslaMotors We are going to modify this so that people only pay a fee if most bays are occupied. If the site is basically deserted; no problem to park.
1,Boring; it's what we do
1,"It shall be called ""The Boring Company"""
1,Traffic is driving me nuts. Am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging...

1,@Contra_9077 sounds right
1,@ArminKeyani All P100D vehicles produced to date; as well as new. This is purely a software optimization.
1,Model X numbers should also improve by 0.1 sec on 0 to 60 and 1/4 mile
1,Looks like the Model S P100D Easter egg will allow it to do 0 to 60 mph in 2.4 sec and a 10.6 sec 1/4 mile via software update next month
1,@ID_AA_Carmack we could enable that; although the cameras use grey; grey; grey; red detection; so it would look a little greyish red :)

1,@John_Gardi We will probably offer that as an option
1,@John_Gardi exactly
1,@MrRoryReid @MykalSoCal @BBC_TopGear @TeslaMotors Loving this thread :)
1,@balaji_kann Primarily aluminium with hot-stamped boron steel reinforcements. B pillar has a glass overlay.

1,My favorite new feature is the always-on max temp control for keeping kids and pets safe from overheating.
1,This is a major overhaul on almost every level compared to V7.

1,@RuthEdick especially well
1,@pfierens Logs were downloaded for NHTSA and NTSB. Identical copies to all.
1,Good thing about radar is that; unlike lidar (which is visible wavelength); it can see through rain; snow; fog and dust
1,@erik_smith1 @ihavetweets certainly moderate and maybe big advances w no incremental hardware

1,Blog on Autopilot by @PeterDiamandis https://t.co/LR5zuw3J9X
1,@bolayer @SwiftOnSecurity US is ~11 deaths per billion miles. WW is 17 deaths per billion. Autopilot already much better than either so far.
1,@c4757p @SwiftOnSecurity Unless we get there and find it isn't enough. Just won't be before 1B.
1,@FantaAIex It is extensively tested in the lab and in the Tesla test fleet. However; there is no substitute for real world experience.
1,@SwiftOnSecurity With less than 1B miles; there simply isn't enough data. 1B is a necessary but not necessarily sufficient condition.
1,"@nicatronTg @SwiftOnSecurity Thanks. Point of calling it ""beta"" was to emphasize to those who chose to use it that it wasn't perfect."

1,@gdoehne @disinformatico @Eddy_Jahn The Google term of self-driving would probably be more appropriate then.
1,@disinformatico @Eddy_Jahn In other words; the intended implication is that a driver must remain alert; just as a pilot must remain alert.

1,Turns out the landing was not as fast we thought; but still hard enough to destroy the primary airframe and accordion the engines
1,@fucktyler Thanks Tyler
1,Landing video will be posted when we gain access to cameras on the droneship later today. Maybe hardest impact to date. Droneship still ok.
1,Upgrades underway to enable rocket to compensate for a thrust shortfall on one of the three landing engines. Probably get there end of year.
1,@AstroOrionMK @BadAstronomer Quite rapid... Yes
1,RUD = Rapid Unscheduled Disassembly :)

1,@spoite @rsmoz Hence the urgency of making life as we know it multiplanetary as soon as possible
1,@rsmoz That; speed of light constraint and quantum mechanics
1,And; no; I'm not an alien...but I used to be one
1,@BenjaminRPhoto @StephenPace Yeah; that matches what we've found so far. More likely unhinged than nefarious.
1,Would seem to indicate that one or more people sought to create the false impression of a safety issue where none existed. Q is why?
1,Of greater concern: 37 of 40 suspension complaints to NHTSA were fraudulent; i.e. false location or vehicle identification numbers were used
1,NHTSA confirmed today that they found no safety concern with the Model S suspension and have no further need for data from us on this matter

1,Fast replay of today's rocket landing on SpaceX droneship OCISLY https://t.co/I0QQ2D3BtE
1,@dfjsteve Very similar. The crush core in the Falcon legs is reusable after soft landings; but needs to be replaced after hard.
1,Crush core is aluminum honeycomb for energy absorption in the telescoping actuator. Easy to replace (if Falcon makes it back to port).
1,Rocket landing speed was close to design max &amp; used up contingency crush core; hence back &amp; forth motion. Prob ok; but some risk of tipping.
1,Satellite deployed to 91;000 km apogee. All looks good.

1,@Erdayastronaut Cool
1,@DefiantLs What a retard
1,@MikeBenzCyber By “we”; you mean you think it was done by Ukraine with US support?
1,So is this a Republican bill or a Democrat bill? 🤔
1,Absolutely
1,The goal of 𝕏 is to return power to the people
1,@jglisson @stillgray Yes; it is a calculated lie by @RepJeffries
1,@robbystarbuck Because he’s a liar
1,@visegrad24 It will get MUCH worse
1,@robbystarbuck Those who allowed this are traitors!

1,@stillgray AP stands for Associated Propaganda
1,@HSajwanization True
1,Exactly
1,@BigImpactHumans @grok No new logo for now. Just xAI and GROK.
1,Obviously NOT “far-right”!  Just common sense policies.
1,He did
1,@AdrianDittmann Ok; but now prove the stuff used to prove that!
1,@diana_dukic Same 😂
1,@Inevitablewest An entirely reasonable position to take
1,@twatterbaas True
1,What a huge liar.   The AfD policies are identical to those of the US Democratic Party when Obama took office! I don’t think there is a single difference.
1,@TheBabylonBee I really do love @realDonaldTrump. He’s awesome.
1,Terrible

1,Such hypocrisy!
1,Exactly
1,@AutismCapital All his puppets said the same thing at the same time.   Deeaaad giveaway!
1,Voter fraud is real
1,@GadSaad I think she was just yelling about me in Congress 😂
1,This platform is more alive than ever!
1,@MarioNawfal Sneaky Sam
1,How to share links:
1,Send your followers to 𝕏!
1,@Rothmus Poster of “DC Swamp Creatures”
1,@DefiantLs They are losing it 😂
1,@ZubyMusic Seriously
1,Wow; some politician in Germany went after 800 citizens just for posting memes!
1,How can a judge cancel an election and not be considered a dictator?
1,@profstonge Is Biden even still alive? Has anyone seen him lately?
1,@mayemusk Yeah
1,I can’t help it I just can’t 🤣🤣
1,The Democrats are lying again 🤨
1,@diana_dukic Rosa before makeup
1,@FilosofiaPolti When is the new election?
1,It’s good that they found this gang; but why are illegals allowed to remain in America after being arrested for serious crimes multiple times?
1,It is obviously meaningless to call our country a democracy if the elected leaders are unable to read legislation before voting!!
1,That is exactly the goal.   The political &amp; legacy media puppets all got their new instructions yesterday and are now parroting the same message to drive a wedge between @realDonaldTrump and me.   They will fail.
1,To bad; so sad he won’t be leader of the senate next year 😢😂

1,@catturd2 He is quite entertaining 😂😂
1,@stillgray It looks like the evil is seeping out of her
1,Has anyone read it?   Radical suggestion:  FIRST read bill; THEN vote.
1,There is legal trickery in length
1,Shifting people from the government sector; which is low productivity; to the private sector; which is high productivity; results in greatly increased prosperity.   Deregulation helps tremendously too.
1,This is the only way to make rapid progress
1,𝕏 provides the platform for the people to pull together for the common good! https://t.co/e1fLlrPYiG

1,@stclairashley Cool
1,Yeah
1,@JeffWCarlton @MarioNawfal Good question
1,@BillAckman @X I hope this passes!
1,Exactly!
1,Incredibly well said  https://t.co/wQloRXMuUP
1,@DanielHarder82 @RepJeffries You got me 😂
1,@KeithOlbermann You elevate Tourette’s to poetry
1,Yeah; it’s absurd to call something a “deal” if almost no one in Congress had even seen the bill until yesterday!
1,@Liberacrat @WallStreetMav Looks like an extra from Wicked 😂
1,@WallStreetMav Oh … forgot to mention that I’m also going to be funding moderate candidates in heavily Democrat districts; so that the country can get rid of those who don’t represent them; like this jackass
1,@stclairashley Yeah!
1,@WallStreetMav What percentage of the government is even working a week before Christmas anyway? My guess is very low.
1,Objectively; the vast majority of Republican House members voted for the spending bill; but only 2 Democrats did.   Therefore; if the government shuts down; it is obviously the fault of @RepJeffries and the Democratic Party.   Plain &amp; simple.
1,@BaldCowboy @MikeBenzCyber Lmaooo
1,@MikeBenzCyber The crazy lady with the purple hair is the top House Dem in charge of spending taxpayer money!? 🤯
1,Shame on @RepJeffries for rejecting a fair &amp; simple spending bill that is desperately needed by states suffering from hurricane damage!
1,A super fair &amp; simple bill was put to a vote and only 2 Democrats in Congress were in favor.   Therefore; responsibility for the shutdown rests squarely on the shoulders of @RepJeffries.
1,@mazemoore I have no power; but also too much power?  🤡 🤣
1,@AutismCapital This is so awesome 😎
1,Unfortunately; propaganda works (sigh).  We need to teach people that any given piece of legislation will do the OPPOSITE of its name!
1,@BasedMikeLee True
1,@JDVance True
1,Oh the irony 😂
1,@SpeakerJohnson Cool
1,@AutismCapital Sam is an evil swindler
1,Exactly
1,First of all; I’m not the author of this proposal. Credit to @realDonaldTrump; @JDVance &amp; @SpeakerJohnson.   Second; this is a MUCH better bill that is closer to being a real continuing resolution (not an omnibus masquerading as a CR); but with support for hurricane victims &amp;
1,@libsoftiktok Giant improvement
1,This shows how much your voice matters!  And having a President like @realDonaldTrump means that your voice is finally heard.
1,@TheRabbitHole84 Major improvement
1,Yesterday’s bill vs today’s bill 😂 https://t.co/L3Omn964mw
1,@chrispavlovski Interesting
1,@matteosalvinimi You did the right thing
1,@Jason @DOGE Yeah
1,@farzyness @KettlebellDan Fine by me
1,America is headed for disaster; with no money for anything; unless the government overspending is addressed
1,@amuse Not a bad idea 🤔
1,Worth getting @Starlink as a backup; even if you already have great Internet.   Your landline connection might go down just when you most need it!
1,@MarioNawfal They are just upset that; for once in a long while; their attempt to pillage taxpayers failed!
1,Deleting nonsense regulations that fail to serve the greater public good will lead to a new age of prosperity
1,It’s getting to the point where doing anything at all is illegal
1,@MarioNawfal @Cobratate Interesting
1,Gives new meaning to “fake it ‘til you make it” 😂
1,@SmallPettingZoo @Rob_2628 @Starlink As you know; being one of the best Druids; killing Lilith in Eternal as that class has at times been absurdly difficult; but you could try 100+ times and only need to visit the blacksmith occasionally for equipment repair
1,@nfergus @TuckerCarlson It is worth hearing Sach’s arguments
1,@ZubyMusic Whoa; it’s happening in the UK too?  That’s been happening in a lot of US cities for several years.

1,@DefiyantlyFree Exactly. The will of the people prevailed.
1,@MarioNawfal It was a great conversation
1,@farzyness Great idea
1,@DefiyantlyFree @RepJeffries Shows how much they want to sneak in legislative changes and major spending increases!
1,@Liv_Boeree Cool!
1,@GuntherEagleman @EricLDaugh 😂  You know it hit home when the people complaining that it didn’t pass are the Dems!
1,@teslaownersSV True 😂
1,@alx @politico Politico are such liars
1,@nicksortor Good question
1,Crazy
1,@jk_rowling Thank you for speaking out. You saved so many.
1,@BillAckman Great idea! That should be required.
1,@stillgray Exactly.   I would have made no progress without the support of the people.
1,@charliekirk11 If we get spending under control pronto; that debt ceiling will be much further out.   Maybe we never hit it.

1,Welcome to the group chat for Earth!
1,@DerrickEvans4WV The people of central Florida will kick this jackass out in 2 years
1,Absolutely.   All I can do is bring things to the attention of the people; so they may voice their support if they so choose.
1,@WallStreetMav The government doesn’t actually shut down when they say “shut down”; as all essential personnel keep working.   So … shut it down.
1,@TheRabbitHole84 I realized it was retarded of me to say retard 😂
1,Total active users on 𝕏 is ~1 billion; but about 40% only come to this platform during major world events
1,@EricLDaugh He’s just mad he didn’t get his 40% raise to a quarter million dollars a year.   “Empathy for working people” my ass.
1,@Austen It’s insane
1,@RepJeffries You seem to think the public is dumb.   They are not.
1,@WholeMarsBlog Asking a Magic 8-Ball whether we should change rates is ACTUALLY better than the Fed!
1,@AutismCapital *Retarded
1,@AutismCapital Retard
1,@AdrianDittmann Such a crazy bill
1,Cool
1,Either there is massive change or America goes bankrupt; therefore there must be massive change!
1,@JDVance Awesome 😎
1,@Liv_Boeree Congrats!
1,@EricLDaugh I’m just pointing it out to the people; so that the politicians can’t do sneaky things
1,@EricLDaugh Indeed; bravo @realannapaulina!
1,Your elected representatives have heard you and now the terrible bill is dead. The voice of the people has triumphed!  VOX POPULI VOX DEI
1,Thank you!
1,Actions matter; sweet talk is irrelevant.   Kill the Bill.
1,Thank you!
1,Great!
1,@megynkelly Same
1,@GuntherEagleman @SenSchumer Exactly
1,Thank you!
1,I meant what I said
1,One of the worst bills ever written
1,Indeed; this is an inflection point.
1,Unless @DOGE ends the careers of deceitful; pork-barrel politicians; the waste and corruption will never stop.   Therefore; there is no choice but to do so.  I wish there was another way; but there is not.
1,@EricLDaugh That’s because they’re too cowardly to do so publicly
1,Thank you!
1,Thank you!
1,Kill the Bill
1,Thank you!
1,Absolutely
1,Exactly; it contains major spending increases and changes to the law.  That is NOT a “continuing” resolution.
1,How to use Grok to understand any piece of legislation or large document on the Internet
1,@SenTuberville Absolutely
1,KILL BILL!
1,“Shutting down” the government (which doesn’t actually shut down critical functions btw) is infinitely better than passing a horrible bill
1,Great!
1,Thank you!
1,@WholeMarsBlog True
1,Stop the steal of your tax dollars!
1,Exactly right. ALL government spending is taxation.   The government either taxes you directly or; by increasing the money supply; taxes you through inflation.   That means the spending bill IS the taxation bill. Very important concept to understand.  @RepThomasMassie
1,@MarioNawfal So many sneaky things in this bill
1,@JohnCornyn It’s a nightmare bill
1,Thank you!
1,@WallStreetMav @SpeakerJohnson What the heck is going on?
1,Thank you!
1,Unconscionable
1,Outrageous!
1,This should not be funded by your tax dollars!
1,The bill they’re trying to pass right now would prevent investigating their wrongdoing!
1,America voted for change; but Congress is not listening. UNACCEPTABLE!!
1,No bills should be passed Congress until Jan 20; when @realDonaldTrump takes office.  None.  Zero.
1,Absolutely
1,Exactly
1,Call your elected representatives today to stop the steal of your tax dollars!  https://t.co/6suIuQMcO4
1,We’re funding bioweapon labs in this bill!
1,Stop the steal of your tax dollars!  Call your elected representatives now.   They are trying to railroad this thing through today!
1,This is insane! This is NOT democracy!  How can your elected representatives be asked to pass a spending bill where they had no input and not even enough time to read it!!??
1,What a scam!
1,Absolutely
1,Thank you!
1,By now; they should know that I mean what I say
1,@KevinKileyCA Thank you!
1,@SenRandPaul @DrJBhattacharya @NIH Absolutely
1,They want to spend YOUR tax dollars on censorsing YOU!!
1,Stop the steal of your tax dollars!
1,@alx Absolutely
1,The more we learn about this criminal bill they are trying to pass today; the worse it gets!!
1,Absolutely; this bill should NOT pass.   A new bill that isn’t an insane crime against the American people should be done in 33 days.
1,Thank you!
1,This bill is criminal
1,This crazy bill needs to stop now
1,@DefiyantlyFree Doesn’t make sense
1,This bill is terrible
1,Please call your elected representatives right away to tell them how you feel!  They are trying to get this passed today while no one is paying attention.
1,Please call your elected representatives right now to stop this madness!
1,This is an outrage
1,THIS CRIMINAL BILL MUST NOT PASS
1,This is insane and has nothing to do with a “continuing resolution”!
1,@TammieMcDonal17 @BrianKempGA Exactly
1,Any member of the House or Senate who votes for this outrageous spending bill deserves to be voted out in 2 years!
1,@TheRabbitHole84 This bill is an outrage!
1,What the heck!!??
1,The more I learn; the more obvious it becomes that this spending bill is a crime.  It even includes funding for the worst illegal censorship operation in the entire government (GEC)!!
1,@Austen Starlink will have 20k to 30k satellites in operation by the time the EU satellites are  all launched; so about 1% of Starlink!  This is a child’s toy compared to Starlink.
1,This bill should not pass
1,@KettlebellDan Yeah; absolutely needs to be rethought
1,Exactly
1,You cell phone in New Zealand now works anywhere!
1,@SmallPettingZoo @Rob_2628 @Starlink Much easier than Lilith; actually; but the catch is that you only get one attempt for each set of stones and the stones are hard to get.   Lilith has almost no penalty for as many attempts as you want.
1,@SmallPettingZoo @Rob_2628 @Starlink Easier than Lilith
1,@GadSaad @PierrePoilievre He seems great
1,@HuinGuillaume @McDonaldsJapan Cool

1,Yes; if action is not taken to curb the deficit; America is in deep trouble.   No different than a person who gets into too much debt.
1,Tap on the box with a slash for Grok to explain any post
1,@cb_doge Yeah. On the list of things to do.
1,Grok can explain almost anything
1,Try the free Grok API

1,@RangarajSrikan1 Yeah
1,@nima_owji Long overdue!
1,@cz_binance Thanks!
1,Try Grok for answering any question; creating any images &amp; analyzing any images; even medical scans!  It’s by far the best at answers requiring latest information; due to integration with 𝕏.  You’ll be surprised at how much Grok can do &amp; it only gets better from here!

1,@jgebbia So crazy. They need to restart/rebuild fission and greatly increase power output.
1,Well-articulated analysis of @Neuralink.  Important edit: bit rate and patient number will increase hyperexponentially over the next 5+ years.   My guess is combined I/O Bit rate &gt; 1Mbs and augmented humans &gt;1M by 2030.
1,@bennyjohnson I will join too
1,@SmokeAwayyy English has the highest bit rate if both parties in the conversation have a large vocabulary.   English has the greatest number of words to describe things by a significant margin.   The more single words you have that can substitute for many words; or even a whole phrase;

1,@sundarpichai That will probably happen.   Any self-respecting civilization should at least reach Kardashev Type II.  In my opinion; we are currently only at &lt;5% of Type I. To get to ~30%; we would need to place solar panels in all desert or highly arid regions.

1,@MarioNawfal One of my SNL sketch ideas was “Woke James Bond”. Sadly; this has become reality.
1,@chamath Little Eric here suffers from a classic case of the zero-sum game fallacy.   The reality is that creating a trillion dollar company from nothing generates wealth for millions of people.   And the reason the company is worth so much is that it makes great products &amp; services that

1,Starlink’s giant latency advantage is the real killer.   Current Starlink satellites at ~550km are ~65 times closer than geosynchronous satellites.   Our next generation satellites will be at ~350km; so &gt;100 times closer.
